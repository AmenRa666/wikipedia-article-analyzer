The '''raccoon''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|k|uː|n}} or {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-raccoon.ogg|US|r|æ|ˈ|k|uː|n}}, ''Procyon lotor''), sometimes spelled '''racoon''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seidl|first=Jennifer|author2=McMordie, W. |editor=Fowler, F.

The raccoon is the largest of the [[procyonidae|procyonid]] [[Family (biology)|family]], having a body length of {{convert|40|to|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a body weight of {{convert|3.5|to|9|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense [[underfur]] which insulates it against cold weather. Two of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front [[paw]]s and its [[Domino mask|facial mask]], which are themes in the [[Native American mythology|mythology of several Native American ethnic groups]]. Raccoons are noted for their [[Animal cognition|intelligence]], with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for up to three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;h7172&quot;&gt;Hohmann, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; The diet of the [[omnivore|omnivorous]] raccoon, which is usually [[nocturnality|nocturnal]], consists of about 40% [[invertebrate]]s, 33% [[plant]] foods, and 27% [[vertebrate]]s.

The original [[habitat]]s of the raccoon are [[deciduous]] and [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas, [[Salt marsh|coastal marshes]], and [[urban area]]s, where some homeowners consider them to be [[Pest (organism)|pests]]. As a result of escapes and deliberate [[introduced species|introductions]] in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across mainland [[Europe]], [[Caucasus|Caucasia]], and [[Japan]].

Though previously thought to be solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in gender-specific [[social behavior]]. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season, and other potential invaders. [[Home range]] sizes vary anywhere from {{convert|3|ha|acre}} for females in cities to {{convert|5000|ha|acre}} for males in [[prairie]]s. After a [[gestation]] period of about 65 days, two to five young, known as &quot;kits&quot;, are born in spring. The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersal in late fall. Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1&amp;nbsp;years. In many areas, [[hunting]] and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Raccoon (Procyon lotor) 2.jpg|thumb|The mask of a raccoon is often interrupted by a brown-black streak that extends from forehead to nose.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The word &quot;raccoon&quot; was adopted into English from the native [[Powhatan language|Powhatan]] term, as used in the [[Virginia Colony]]. It was recorded on [[Captain John Smith]]'s list of Powhatan words as ''aroughcun'', and on that of [[William Strachey]] as ''arathkone''.&lt;ref&gt;Other attested colonial spellings of the Powhatan word include: ''racone'', ''arrathcune'', ''arathcoon'', ''aroucoun'', and ''rahaughcun''. {{cite journal | last1 = Vogel | first1 = Virgil J. | year = 1962 | title = Indian Place Names in Illinois | journal = Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society | volume = 55 | issue = 4 | page = 400 | jstor = 40190265}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been identified as a [[Proto-Algonquian]] root ''*ahrah-koon-em'', meaning &quot;[the] one who rubs, scrubs and scratches with its hands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmgren|first=Virginia C.|title=Raccoons: In Folklore, History &amp; Today's Backyards|year=1990|publisher=Capra Pres|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonists]] adopted the Spanish word {{lang|es|''mapache''}} from the [[Nahuatl]] ''mapachitli'' of the [[Aztec]]s, meaning &quot;[the] one who takes everything in its hands&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;holmgren52&quot;&gt;Holmgren, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In many languages, the raccoon is named for its characteristic dousing behavior in conjunction with that language's term for ''bear'', for example {{lang|de|''Waschbär''}} in German, {{lang|it|''orsetto lavatore''}} in Italian, {{lang|hu|''mosómedve''}} in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and ''araiguma'' ({{lang|ja|アライグマ}}) in Japanese. In French and European Portuguese, the washing behavior is combined with these languages' term for ''rat'', yielding, respectively, {{lang|fr|''raton laveur''}} and ''ratão-lavadeiro''. The raccoon's scientific name, ''Procyon lotor'', is [[New Latin|neo-Latin]], meaning &quot;before-dog washer&quot;, with ''lotor'' [[Latin]] for &quot;washer&quot; and ''Procyon'' Latinized [[Greek language|Greek]] from προ-, &quot;before&quot; and κύων, &quot;dog&quot;.

The [[colloquialism|colloquial]] abbreviation ''coon'' is used in words like ''coonskin'' for [[fur clothing]] and in phrases like ''old coon'' as a self-designation of [[animal trapping|trappers]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, pp. 75–76; Zeveloff, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1830s, the U.S. [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] used the raccoon as an emblem, causing them to be pejoratively known as 'coons' by their political opponents, who saw them as too sympathetic to African-Americans. Soon after that it became an [[ethnic slur]],&lt;ref&gt;Sotiroupoulos, Karen, ''Staging Race: Black Performers in Turn of the century America'', Harvard University Press, 2006, pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt; especially in use between 1880 and 1920 (see ''[[coon song]]''), and the term is still considered offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188830,00.html |title=Radio Talk Show Host Fired for Racial Slur Against Condoleezza Rice – Politics &amp;#124; Republican Party &amp;#124; Democratic Party &amp;#124; Political Spectrum |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=March 22, 2006 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy ==
{{double image|right|Raccoons of North &amp; Middle America (1950) Skins of subgenera procyon &amp; euprocyon.png|65|Raccoons of North &amp; Middle America (1950) P. lotor &amp; P. cancrivorus.png|180|Skins of ''P. lotor'' and ''[[crab-eating raccoon|P. cancrivorus]]''|Skulls of ''P. lotor'' and ''P. cancrivorus''}}

In the first decades after its discovery by the members of the expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was the first person to leave a written record about the species, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] thought the raccoon was related to many different species, including [[Canidae|dogs]], [[Felidae|cats]], [[badger]]s and particularly [[bear]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, pp. 47–67&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus]], the father of modern taxonomy, placed the raccoon in the genus ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'', first as ''Ursus cauda elongata'' (&quot;long-tailed bear&quot;) in the second edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1740), then as ''Ursus Lotor'' (&quot;washer bear&quot;) in the tenth edition (1758–59).&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, pp. 64–67; Zeveloff, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1780, [[Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr]] placed the raccoon in its own genus ''[[Procyon (genus)|Procyon]]'', which can be translated as either &quot;before the dog&quot; or &quot;doglike&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, pp. 68–69; Zeveloff, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Storr had its [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] lifestyle in mind and chose the star [[Procyon]] as eponym for the species.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 44; Holmgren, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution ===
Based on [[fossil]] evidence from France and Germany, the first known members of the family ''[[Procyonidae]]'' lived in Europe in the late [[Oligocene]] about 25 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Similar tooth and skull structures suggest procyonids and [[Mustelidae|weasels]] share a common ancestor, but molecular analysis indicates a closer relationship between raccoons and bears.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 16–18, 26&lt;/ref&gt; After the then-existing species crossed the [[Bering Strait]] at least six million years later in the early [[Miocene]], the center of its distribution was probably in Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 20, 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coati]]s (''Nasua'' and ''Nasuella'') and raccoons (''Procyon'') have been considered to share common descent from a species in the genus ''Paranasua'' present between 5.2 and 6.0&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption, based on morphological comparisons of fossils, conflicts with a 2006 genetic analysis which indicates raccoons are more closely related to [[Bassariscus|ringtails]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koepfli|first=Klaus-Peter|author2=Gompper, Matthew E. |author3=Eizirik, Eduardo |author4=Ho, Cheuk-Chung |author5=Linden, Leif |author6=Maldonado, Jesus E. |author7= Wayne, Robert K. |date=June 2007|title=Phylogeny of the Procyonidae (Mammalia: Carnivora): Molecules, morphology and the Great American Interchange|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=1076–1095 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |issn=1055-7903 |url=http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/6026/1/Koepfli_2007phylogeny_of_the_procy.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=December 7, 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.10.003 |pmid=17174109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other procyonids, such as the [[crab-eating raccoon]] (''Procyon cancrivorus''), the ancestors of the common raccoon left [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] areas and migrated farther north about 2.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago, in a migration that has been confirmed by the discovery of fossils in the [[Great Plains]] dating back to the middle of the [[Pliocene]].&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 46; Zeveloff, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Its most recent ancestor was likely ''Procyon rexroadensis'', a large [[Blancan]] raccoon from the [[Rexroad Formation]] characterized by its narrow back teeth and large lower jaw.&lt;ref name=&quot;kurten1980&quot;&gt;[[Björn Kurtén|Kurtén, Björn]] (1980). ''Pleistocene Mammals of North America''. pp. 175-6. Columbia University Press. ISBN 0-231-03733-3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subspecies ===
[[File:Raccoon Cudjoe Key Florida.jpg|thumb|A Torch Key raccoon (''P. l. incautus'') in  [[Cudjoe Key]], Florida. Subspecies inhabiting the [[Florida Keys]] are characterized by their small size and very pale fur.]]

As of 2005, ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' recognizes 22 subspecies.&lt;ref name=&quot;msw3&quot;&gt;{{MSW3 Carnivora | id = 14001664 | page = 627–628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of these subspecies [[Endemism|found only]] on small Central American and [[Caribbean]] islands were often regarded as distinct species after their discovery. These are the [[Bahaman raccoon]] and [[Guadeloupe raccoon]], which are very similar to each other; the [[Tres Marias raccoon]], which is larger than average and has an angular skull; and the [[extinction|extinct]] [[Barbados raccoon]]. Studies of their morphological and genetic traits in 1999, 2003 and 2005 led all these [[island raccoon]]s to be listed as [[subspecies]] of the common raccoon in ''Mammal Species of the World's'' third edition. A fifth island raccoon population, the [[Cozumel raccoon]], which weighs only {{convert|3|to|4|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} and has notably small teeth, is still regarded as a separate species.&lt;ref name=&quot;msw3b&quot;&gt;{{MSW3 Carnivora | id = 14001687 | page = 628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 42–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helgen|first=Kristofer M.|author2=Wilson, Don E. |date=January 2003|title=Taxonomic status and conservation relevance of the raccoons (''Procyon'' spp.) of the West Indies|journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=259|issue=1|pages=69–76|publisher=The Zoological Society of London|location=Oxford|issn=0952-8369|doi=10.1017/S0952836902002972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Helgen|first=Kristofer M.|author2=Wilson, Don E. |editor=Sánchez-Cordero, Víctor |editor2=Medellín, Rodrigo A.|title=Contribuciones mastozoológicas en homenaje a Bernardo Villa |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=PQphdAd9KKcC }} |accessdate=December 7, 2008|year=2005|publisher=Instituto de Ecología of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México|location=Mexico City|isbn=978-970-32-2603-0|page=230|chapter=A Systematic and Zoogeographic Overview of the Raccoons of Mexico and Central America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four smallest raccoon subspecies, with a typical weight of {{convert|1.8|to|2.7|kg|lb|1|sp=us|abbr=on}}, are found along the southern coast of [[Florida]] and on the adjacent islands; an example is the Ten Thousand Island raccoon (''Procyon lotor marinus'').&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 59, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other 15 subspecies differ only slightly from each other in coat color, size and other physical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 9; Zeveloff, pp. 79–89&lt;/ref&gt; The two most widespread subspecies are the eastern raccoon (''Procyon lotor lotor'') and the Upper Mississippi Valley raccoon (''Procyon lotor hirtus''). Both share a comparatively dark coat with long hairs, but the Upper Mississippi Valley raccoon is larger than the eastern raccoon. The eastern raccoon occurs in all U.S. states and Canadian provinces to the north of [[South Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]]. The adjacent range of the Upper Mississippi Valley raccoon covers all U.S. states and Canadian provinces to the north of [[Louisiana]], [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 79–81, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The taxonomic identity of feral raccoons inhabiting Eurasia is unknown, as the founding populations consisted of uncategorized specimens from zoos and fur farms.&lt;ref name=&quot;s1383&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical characteristics ===
Head to hindquarters, raccoons measure between {{convert|40|and|70|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, not including the bushy tail which can
measure between {{convert|20|and|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, but is usually not much longer than {{convert|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 77; Lagoni-Hansen, p. 15; Zeveloff, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The shoulder height is between {{convert|23|and|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lagoni-Hansen, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The body weight of an adult raccoon varies considerably with [[habitat]], making the raccoon one of the most variably sized mammals. It can range from {{convert|2|to|14|kg|lb|sigfig=1}}, but is usually between {{convert|3.5|and|9|kg|lb|sigfig=1}}. The smallest specimens are found in southern Florida, while those near the northern limits of the raccoon's range tend to be the largest (see [[Bergmann's rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; Males are usually 15 to 20% heavier than females.&lt;ref&gt;Lagoni-Hansen, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of winter, a raccoon can weigh twice as much as in spring because of fat storage.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p.47–48; MacClintock, p. 44; Zeveloff, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The largest recorded wild raccoon weighed {{convert|28.4|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} and measured {{convert|140|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length, by far the largest size recorded for a procyonid.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 8; Zeveloff, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boitani, Luigi, ''Simon &amp; Schuster's Guide to Mammals''. Simon &amp; Schuster/Touchstone Books (1984), ISBN 978-0-671-42805-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The most characteristic physical feature of the raccoon is the area of black [[fur]] around the eyes, which contrasts sharply with the surrounding white face coloring. This is reminiscent of a &quot;[[Domino mask|bandit's mask]]&quot; and has thus enhanced the animal's reputation for mischief.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p.6; Zeveloff, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The slightly rounded ears are also bordered by white fur. Raccoons are assumed to recognize the facial expression and posture of other members of their species more quickly because of the conspicuous facial coloration and the alternating light and dark rings on the tail.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mc5-6z63&quot; /&gt; The dark mask may also reduce [[glare (vision)|glare]] and thus enhance [[night vision]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mc5-6z63&quot;&gt;MacClintock, pp. 5–6; Zeveloff, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; On other parts of the body, the long and stiff [[guard hair]]s, which shed moisture, are usually colored in shades of gray and, to a lesser extent, brown.&lt;ref name=&quot;z60&quot;&gt;Zeveloff, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Raccoons with a very dark coat are more common in the German population because individuals with such coloring were among those initially released to the wild.&lt;ref name=&quot;stellungnahme&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projekt-waschbaer.de/aktuelles/stellungnahme-oekologie/|title=Ökologische und ökonomische Bedeutung des Waschbären in Mitteleuropa – Eine Stellungnahme|accessdate=December 7, 2008|last=Michler|first=Frank-Uwe|author2=Köhnemann, Berit A.|date=May 2008|work=&quot;Projekt Waschbär&quot;|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dense [[underfur]], which accounts for almost 90% of the coat, insulates against cold weather and is composed of {{convert|2|to|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long hairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;z60&quot; /&gt;

The raccoon, whose method of [[Terrestrial locomotion|locomotion]] is usually considered to be [[plantigrade]], can stand on its hind legs to examine objects with its front paws.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 57; Zeveloff, p. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; As raccoons have short legs compared to their compact torso, they are usually not able either to run quickly or jump great distances.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 93; Zeveloff, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Their top speed over short distances is {{convert|16|to|24|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Andrew D.|title=Adirondack Mammals|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, New York|date=March 1989|isbn=978-0-8156-8115-1|page=256| chapter=Raccoon|chapterurl=http://www.esf.edu/aec/adks/mammals/raccoon.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raccoons can swim with an average speed of about {{convert|5|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and can stay in the water for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 33; Zeveloff, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; For climbing down a tree headfirst—an unusual ability for a mammal of its size—a raccoon rotates its hind feet so they are pointing backwards.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 30; Zeveloff, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Raccoons have a dual cooling system to [[Thermoregulation|regulate their temperature]]; that is, they are able to both sweat and pant for heat dissipation.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 29; Zeveloff, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Raccoon skulls have a short and wide facial region and a voluminous [[braincase]]. The [[Facial skeleton|facial]] length of the skull is less than the [[Neurocranium|cranial]], and their [[nasal bone]]s are short and quite broad. The [[auditory bulla]]e are inflated in form, and the [[sagittal crest]] is weakly developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;s1375&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1375–1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dentition]] — 40 teeth with the [[dental formula]]:{{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.2|lower=3.1.4.2}} — is adapted to their [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet: the [[carnassial]]s are not as sharp and pointed as those of a full-time [[carnivore]], but the [[molar (tooth)|molars]] are not as wide as those of a [[herbivory|herbivore]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[baculum|penis bone]] of males is about {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and strongly bent at the front end.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 27; MacClintock, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile males are distinguished from mature males by the shape and extrusibility of their penis bones.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Glen C., and Andrew Vladimir Nalbandov. &quot;[https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/44058/Bulletin31(2).pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y The reproductive cycle of the raccoon in Illinois.]&quot; Illinois Natural History Survey Bulletin; v. 031, no. 02 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okuyama, Minami W., et al. &quot;[http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/58177/1/Minami_Okuyama.pdf Timing of puberty and its relationship with body growth and season in male raccoons (Procyon lotor) in Hokkaido.]&quot; Journal of Reproduction and Development 59.4 (2013): 361-367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SchwartzSchwartz2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Walsh Schwartz|author2=Elizabeth Reeder Schwartz|title=The Wild Mammals of Missouri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEWl0ZM6DfUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=(genital%20OR%20penis%20OR%20baculum)&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1359-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the thirteen identified vocal calls are used in [[Animal communication|communication]] between the mother and her kits, one of these being the birdlike twittering of newborns.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 66; MacClintock, p. 92; Zeveloff, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Senses ===
The most important sense for the raccoon is its [[Somatosensory system|sense of touch]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 13; Hohmann, p. 55; Zeveloff, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;hyper sensitive&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; front paws are protected by a thin [[Stratum corneum|horny layer]] which becomes pliable when wet.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 56–59; MacClintock, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The five digits of the paws have no webbing between them, which is unusual for a [[carnivoran]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Almost two-thirds of the area responsible for [[perception|sensory perception]] in the raccoon's [[cerebral cortex]] is specialized for the interpretation of tactile impulses, more than in any other studied animal.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; They are able to identify objects before touching them with [[vibrissa]]e located above their sharp, nonretractable [[claw]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 57; Zeveloff, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The raccoon's paws lack an opposable [[thumb]]; thus, it does not have the agility of the hands of [[primate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 15; Zeveloff, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; There is no observed negative effect on tactile perception when a raccoon stands in water below 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F) for hours.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Raccoons are thought to be [[color blindness|color blind]] or at least poorly able to distinguish color, though their eyes are well-adapted for sensing green light.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 63; MacClintock, p. 18; Zeveloff, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Although their [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] of 11 [[dioptre]] is comparable to that of humans and they see well in twilight because of the [[tapetum lucidum]] behind the [[retina]], [[visual perception]] is of subordinate importance to raccoons because of their poor long-distance vision.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 63–65; MacClintock, pp. 18–21; Zeveloff, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being useful for orientation in the dark, their [[olfaction|sense of smell]] is important for intraspecific communication. Glandular [[secretion]]s (usually from their [[anal glands]]), urine and feces are used for marking.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 67–70; MacClintock, p. 17; Zeveloff, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; With their broad [[hearing (sense)|auditory range]], they can perceive tones up to 50–85&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]] as well as quiet noises, like those produced by [[earthworm]]s underground.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 66, 72; Zeveloff, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligence ===
Zoologist [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] described raccoons as &quot;clever beasts&quot;, and that &quot;in certain directions their cunning surpasses that of the fox.&quot; The animal's intelligence gave rise to the epithet &quot;sly coon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam1884&quot;&gt;Merriam, C. H. (1884), ''[https://archive.org/stream/mammalsofadirond00merr#page/90/mode/2up The mammals of the Adirondack region, northeastern New York : with an introductory chapter treating of the location and boundaries of the region, its geological history, topography, climate, general features, botany, and faunal position]'', New York : Published by the author, pp. 91-95&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few studies have been undertaken to determine the mental abilities of raccoons, most of them based on the animal's sense of touch. In a study by the [[ethology|ethologist]] H. B. Davis in 1908, raccoons were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in fewer than 10 tries and had no problems repeating the action when the locks were rearranged or turned upside down. Davis concluded they understood the [[abstraction|abstract]] principles of the locking mechanisms and their [[learning speed]] was equivalent to that of [[rhesus macaque]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=H. B.|date=October 1907|title=The Raccoon: A Study in Animal Intelligence|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=18|issue=4|pages=447–489|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Champaign, Illinois|doi=10.2307/1412576|jstor=1412576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in 1963, 1973, 1975 and 1992 concentrated on raccoon [[memory]] showed they can remember the solutions to tasks for up to three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;h7172&quot; /&gt; In a study by B. Pohl in 1992, raccoons were able to instantly differentiate between identical and different symbols three years after the short initial learning phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;h7172&quot; /&gt; [[Stanislas Dehaene]] reports in his book ''The Number Sense'' raccoons can distinguish boxes containing two or four grapes from those containing three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Dehaene|first= Stanislas|title= The number sense|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511004-8|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior ==

=== Social behavior ===
[[File:Three raccoons in a tree.jpg|thumb|Eastern raccoons (''P. l. lotor'') in a tree: The raccoon's social structure is grouped into what [[Ulf Hohmann]] calls a &quot;three class society&quot;.]]

Studies in the 1990s by the ethologists Stanley D. Gehrt and [[Ulf Hohmann]] suggest that raccoons engage in gender-specific [[social behavior]]s and are not typically solitary, as was previously thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;gehrt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehrt|first=Stanley D.|title=Raccoon social organization in South Texas|year= 1994}} (Dissertation at the University of Missouri-Columbia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 133–155&lt;/ref&gt; Related females often live in a so-called &quot;[[fission-fusion society]]&quot;, that is, they share a common area and occasionally meet at feeding or resting grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, pp. 10–12; Hohmann, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Unrelated males often form loose male social groups to maintain their position against foreign males during the [[mating season]]—or against other potential invaders.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 152–154&lt;/ref&gt; Such a group does not usually consist of more than four individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 12; Hohmann, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Since some males show aggressive behavior towards unrelated kits, mothers will isolate themselves from other raccoons until their kits are big enough to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 124–126, 155&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to these three different modes of life prevalent among raccoons, Hohmann called their [[social structure]] a &quot;three class society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel I. Zeveloff, professor of [[zoology]] at [[Weber State University]] and author of the book ''Raccoons: A Natural History'', is more cautious in his interpretation and concludes at least the females are solitary most of the time and, according to Erik K. Fritzell's study in [[North Dakota]] in 1978, males in areas with low population densities are solitary as well.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 137–139&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape and size of a raccoon's [[home range]] varies depending on age, sex, and habitat, with adults claiming areas more than twice as large as juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; While the size of home ranges in the inhospitable habitat of North Dakota's [[prairie]]s lie between {{convert|7|and|50|km2|sqmi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} for males and between {{convert|2|and|16|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} for females, the average size in a [[marsh]] at [[Lake Erie]] was {{convert|0.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of whether the home ranges of adjacent groups overlap, they are most likely not actively defended outside the mating season if food supplies are sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; Odor marks on prominent spots are assumed to establish home ranges and identify individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Urine and feces left at shared [[raccoon latrine]]s may provide additional information about feeding grounds, since raccoons were observed to meet there later for collective eating, sleeping and playing.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 142–147&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the general behavior patterns of raccoons, Gehrt points out that &quot;typically you'll find 10 to 15 percent that will do the opposite&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagowildernessmag.org/issues/summer2002/raccoons.html|title=The City Raccoon and the Country Raccoon|accessdate=December 7, 2008|last=Riddell|first=Jill|year=2002|work=Chicago Wilderness Magazine|publisher=Chicago Wilderness Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; of what is expected.

=== Diet ===
Though usually nocturnal, the raccoon is sometimes active in daylight to take advantage of available food sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;b10z99&quot;&gt;Bartussek, p. 10; Zeveloff, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Its diet consists of about 40% [[invertebrate]]s, 33% [[plant]] material and 27% [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Since its diet consists of such a variety of different foods, Zeveloff argues the raccoon &quot;may well be one of the world's most omnivorous animals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; While its diet in spring and early summer consists mostly of insects, worms, and other animals already available early in the year, it prefers fruits and nuts, such as [[acorn]]s and walnuts, which emerge in late summer and autumn, and represent a rich calorie source for building up fat needed for winter.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 85–88; MacClintock, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, raccoons only occasionally eat active or large prey, such as [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s.
They prefer prey that is easier to catch, specifically [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s and bird eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; When food is plentiful, raccoons can develop strong individual preferences for specific foods.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern parts of their range, raccoons go into a [[winter rest]], reducing their activity drastically as long as a permanent snow cover makes searching for food impossible.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, pp. 108–113&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dousing ===
[[File:Procyon lotor 7 - am Wasser.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Captive raccoons often douse their food before eating.]]

One aspect of raccoon behavior is so well known that it gives the animal part of its scientific name, ''Procyon lotor''; &quot;lotor&quot; is neo-Latin for &quot;washer&quot;.  In the wild, raccoons often dabble for underwater food near the shore-line.  They then often pick up the food item with their front paws to examine it and rub the item, sometimes to remove unwanted parts.  This gives the appearance of the raccoon &quot;washing&quot; the food. The tactile sensitivity of raccoons' paws is increased if this rubbing action is performed underwater, since the water softens the hard layer covering the paws.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 55; Zeveloff, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; However, the behavior observed in captive raccoons in which they carry their food to water to &quot;wash&quot; or douse it before eating has not been observed in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Lagoni-Hansen, p. 41; MacClintock, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural history|Naturalist]] [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], believed that raccoons do not have adequate [[salivary gland|saliva production]] to moisten food thereby necessitating dousing, but this hypothesis is now considered to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, p. 70; Lagoni-Hansen, p. 41; MacClintock, p. 57; Zeveloff, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Captive raccoons douse their food more frequently when a watering hole with a layout similar to a stream is not farther away than {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;mc57&quot;&gt;MacClintock, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The widely accepted theory is that dousing in captive raccoons is a [[fixed action pattern]] from the dabbling behavior performed when foraging at shores for aquatic foods.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 44–45; Lagoni-Hansen, pp. 41–42; MacClintock, p. 57; Zeveloff, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the observation that aquatic foods are doused more frequently. Cleaning dirty food does not seem to be a reason for &quot;washing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mc57&quot; /&gt; Experts have cast doubt on the veracity of observations of wild raccoons dousing food.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, p. 22 (pro); Lagoni-Hansen, p. 41 (contra); MacClintock, p. 57 (contra)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Raccoons usually [[mating|mate]] in a period triggered by increasing daylight between late January and mid-March.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 150; MacClintock, p. 81; Zeveloff, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are large regional differences which are not completely explicable by solar conditions. For example, while raccoons in southern states typically mate later than average, the mating season in [[Manitoba]] also peaks later than usual in March and extends until June.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; During the mating season, males restlessly roam their home ranges in search of females in an attempt to court them during the three- to four-day period when conception is possible. These encounters will often occur at central meeting places.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 148–150; Lagoni-Hansen, p. 47; MacClintock, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual intercourse|Copulation]], including foreplay, can last over an hour and is repeated over several nights.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; The weaker members of a ''male social group'' also are assumed to get the opportunity to mate, since the stronger ones cannot mate with all available females.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in southern Texas during the mating seasons from 1990 to 1992, about one third of all females mated with more than one male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehrt|first=Stanley|author2=Fritzell, Erik K. |date=March 1999|title=Behavioural aspects of the raccoon mating system: determinants of consortship success|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=57|issue=3|pages=593–601|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|issn=0003-3472|doi=10.1006/anbe.1998.1037|pmid=10196048}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a female does not become [[pregnancy|pregnant]] or if she loses her kits early, she will sometimes become fertile again 80 to 140&amp;nbsp;days later.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 125; Lagoni-Hansen, p. 45; Zeveloff, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Common Raccoon (Procyon lotor) in Northwest Indiana.jpg|left|thumb|An eastern raccoon (''P. l. lotor'') kit]]

After usually 63 to 65&amp;nbsp;days of [[gestation]] (although anywhere from 54 to 70&amp;nbsp;days is possible), a [[litter (animal)|litter]] of typically two to five young is born.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 131; Zeveloff, pp. 121, 126&lt;/ref&gt; The average litter size varies widely with habitat, ranging from 2.5 in [[Alabama]] to 4.8 in [[North Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;Lagoni-Hansen, p. 50; Zeveloff, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Larger litters are more common in areas with a high mortality rate, due, for example, to [[hunting]] or severe winters.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 32; Zeveloff, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; While male yearlings usually reach their sexual maturity only after the main mating season, female yearlings can compensate for high mortality rates and may be responsible for about 50% of all young born in a year.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 163; MacClintock, p. 82; Zeveloff, pp. 123–127&lt;/ref&gt; Males have no part in raising young.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 12; Hohmann, p. 111; MacClintock, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The kits (also called &quot;cubs&quot;) are blind and deaf at birth, but their mask is already visible against their light fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;zp127&quot;&gt;Hohmann, pp. 114, 117; Zeveloff, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The birth weight of the about {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}-long kits is between {{convert|60|and|75|g|oz|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Their ear canals open after around 18 to 23&amp;nbsp;days, a few days before their eyes open for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Once the kits weigh about {{convert|1|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, they begin to explore outside the den, consuming solid food for the first time after six to nine&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 119; MacClintock, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; After this point, their mother [[Lactation|suckles]] them with decreasing frequency; they are usually weaned by 16&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall, after their mother has shown them dens and feeding grounds, the juvenile group splits up.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 126–127. Zeveloff, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; While many females will stay close to the home range of their mother, males can sometimes move more than {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 130; Zeveloff, pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered an [[instinct]]ive behavior, preventing [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 128; Zeveloff, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; However, mother and offspring may share a den during the first winter in cold areas.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life expectancy ===
[[File:Racoon crossing road.JPG|right|thumb|Young Florida raccoon (''P. l. elucus'') crossing a road]]

Captive raccoons have been known to live for more than 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, the species' life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1&amp;nbsp;years, depending on the local conditions in terms of traffic volume, hunting, and weather severity.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual for only half of the young born in one year to survive a full year.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 163; Zeveloff, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; After this point, the annual mortality rate drops to between 10% and 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Young raccoons are vulnerable to losing their mother and to starvation, particularly in long and cold winters.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequent natural cause of death in the North American raccoon population is [[Canine distemper|distemper]], which can reach [[epidemic]] proportions and kill most of a local raccoon population.&lt;ref name=&quot;ergebnisse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projekt-waschbaer.de/erste-ergebnisse/|title=Erste Ergebnisse|accessdate=December 7, 2008|last=Michler|first=Frank-Uwe|author2=Köhnemann, Berit A.|date=June 2008|work=&quot;Projekt Waschbär&quot;|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas with heavy vehicular traffic and extensive hunting, these factors can account for up to 90% of all deaths of adult raccoons.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a broad range of range overlap with these predators, the most important natural [[predation|predators]] of the raccoon are [[bobcat]]s, [[coyote]]s, and [[great horned owl]]s, the latter mainly preying on young raccoons but capable of killing adults in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Fritts, S.

== Range ==
[[File:Raccoon in bayou.jpg|left|thumb|Mississippi Delta raccoon (''P. l. megaloudus'') searching for food on a lake shore]]

=== Habitat ===
Although they have thrived in sparsely wooded areas in the last decades, raccoons depend on vertical structures to climb when they feel threatened.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 93–94; Zeveloff, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they avoid open terrain and areas with high concentrations of [[beech]] trees, as beech [[bark]] is too smooth to climb.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tree hollow]]s in old [[oak]]s or other trees and rock crevices are preferred by raccoons as sleeping, winter and litter dens. If such dens are unavailable or accessing them is inconvenient, raccoons use [[burrow]]s dug by other mammals, dense [[undergrowth]] or tree crotches.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 97–101; Zeveloff, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in the [[Solling]] range of hills in Germany, more than 60% of all sleeping places were used only once, but those used at least ten times accounted for about 70% of all uses.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Since amphibians, [[crustacean]]s, and other animals found around the shore of lakes and rivers are an important part of the raccoon's diet, lowland [[deciduous]] or [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]] abundant with water and marshes sustain the highest population densities.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 160; Zeveloff, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; While population densities range from 0.5 to 3.2 animals per square kilometer (1.3 to 8.3 animals per square mile) in prairies and do not usually exceed 6 animals per square kilometer (15.5 animals per square mile) in upland hardwood forests, more than 20 raccoons per square kilometer (51.8 animals per square mile) can live in lowland forests and marshes.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 160; Zeveloff, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution in North America ===
[[File:Albino raccoon.png|thumb|An [[albino]] Florida raccoon (''P. l. elucus'') in [[Virginia Key]], Florida]]

Raccoons are common throughout North America from Canada to [[Panama]], where the subspecies ''Procyon lotor pumilus'' coexists with the [[crab-eating raccoon]] (''Procyon cancrivorus'').&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 12, 46; Zeveloff, pp. 75, 88&lt;/ref&gt; The population on [[Hispaniola]] was exterminated as early as 1513 by Spanish colonists who hunted them for their meat.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Raccoons were also exterminated in [[Cuba]] and [[Jamaica]], where the last sightings were reported in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; When they were still considered separate species, the Bahamas raccoon, Guadeloupe raccoon and Tres Marias raccoon were classified as [[Endangered species|endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 42–45&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that in [[pre-Columbian]] times raccoons were numerous only along rivers and in the woodlands of the [[Southeastern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; As raccoons were not mentioned in earlier reports of [[American pioneer|pioneers]] exploring the central and north-central parts of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; their initial spread may have begun a few decades before the 20th century. Since the 1950s, raccoons have expanded their range from [[Vancouver Island]]—formerly the northernmost limit of their range—far into the northern portions of the four south-central Canadian provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; New habitats which have recently been occupied by raccoons (aside from urban areas) include mountain ranges, such as the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], prairies and [[Salt marsh|coastal marshes]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; After a population explosion starting in the 1940s, the estimated number of raccoons in North America in the late 1980s was 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;times higher than in the 1930s, when raccoons were comparatively rare.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urbanization]], the expansion of [[agriculture]], deliberate introductions, and the extermination of natural predators of the raccoon have probably caused this increase in abundance and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution outside North America ===
As a result of escapes and deliberate [[introduced species|introductions]] in the mid-20th century, the raccoon is now distributed in several European and Asian countries. Sightings have occurred in all the countries bordering Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Lagoni-Hansen, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Another stable population exists in northern France, where several pet raccoons were released by members of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] near the [[Laon-Couvron Air Base]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, raccoons have been known to be in the area around [[Madrid]] since the early 1970s. In 2013 the city authorized &quot;the capture and death of any specimen&quot; found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/22/madrid-raccoon-parrot-plague|title = Madrid declares war on plague of raccoon and parrot invaders|last = Burger|first = Stephen|date = July 22, 2013|work = |access-date = May 4, 2015|via = |newspaper = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also present in [[Italy]], with one reproductive population in [[Lombardy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mori|first1=Emiliano|last2=Mazza|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Menchetti|first3=Mattia|last4=Panzeri|first4=Mattia|last5=Gager|first5=Yann|last6=Bertolino|first6=Sandro|last7=Di Febbraro|first7=Mirko|title=The masked invader strikes again: the conquest of Italy by the Northern raccoon|journal=Hystrix|date=2015|volume=26|issue=1|pages=47–51|doi=10.4404/hystrix-26.1-11035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki /&gt;About 1,240 animals were released in nine regions of the former [[Soviet Union]] between 1936 and 1958 for the purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur. Two of these introductions were successful — one in the south of [[Belarus]] between 1954 and 1958, and another in [[Azerbaijan]] between 1941 and 1957. With a seasonal harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500&amp;nbsp;animals, in 1974 the estimated size of the population distributed in the [[Caucasus]] region was around 20,000&amp;nbsp;animals and the density was four animals per square kilometer (10&amp;nbsp;animals per square mile).&lt;ref&gt;Lagoni-Hansen, pp. 90–92&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distribution in Japan ====
In Japan, up to 1,500&amp;nbsp;raccoons were imported as pets each year after the success of the [[anime]] series ''[[Rascal the Raccoon]]'' (1977).

==== Distribution in Germany ====
In Germany—where the raccoon is called the ''Waschbär'' (literally, &quot;wash-bear&quot; or &quot;washing bear&quot;) due to its habit of &quot;dousing&quot; food in water—two pairs of pet raccoons were released into the German countryside at the [[Edersee]] reservoir in the north of [[Hesse]] in April 1934 by a forester upon request of their owner, a poultry farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; He released them two weeks before receiving permission from the [[Prussia]]n hunting office to &quot;enrich the [[fauna]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Several prior attempts to introduce raccoons in Germany were not successful.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 11; Lagoni-Hansen, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; A second population was established in eastern Germany in 1945 when 25 raccoons escaped from a [[fur farming|fur farm]] at Wolfshagen, east of Berlin, after an air strike. The two populations are parasitologically distinguishable: 70% of the raccoons of the Hessian population are infected with the [[Nematode|roundworm]] ''[[Baylisascaris procyonis]]'', but none of the [[Brandenburg]]ian population has the parasite.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Hohmann, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated number of raccoons was 285 animals in the Hessian region in 1956, over 20,000 animals in the Hessian region in 1970 and between 200,000 and 400,000&amp;nbsp;animals in the whole of Germany in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ergebnisse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 it was estimated that Germany now had more than a million raccoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-overrun-by-raccoon-invasion-a-847847.html|title = Raccoon Invasion: Germany Overrun by Hordes of Masked Omnivores|last = Schulz|first = Matthias|date = August 3, 2012|work = |access-date = May 4, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The raccoon was a protected species in Germany, but has been declared a [[game (food)|game animal]] in 14 [[States of Germany|states]] since 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 18, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hunters and [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] argue the raccoon spreads uncontrollably, threatens protected bird species and supersedes domestic [[carnivora]]ns.&lt;ref name=&quot;stellungnahme&quot; /&gt; This view is opposed by the zoologist Frank-Uwe Michler, who finds no evidence a high population density of raccoons has negative effects on the [[biodiversity]] of an area.&lt;ref name=&quot;stellungnahme&quot; /&gt; Hohmann holds that extensive hunting cannot be justified by the absence of natural predators, because predation is not a significant cause of death in the North American raccoon population.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distribution in the former USSR ====
Experiments in acclimatising raccoons into the USSR began in 1936, and were repeated a further 25 times until 1962. Overall, 1,222 individuals were released, 64 of which came from zoos and fur farms (38 of them having been imports from western Europe). The remainder originated from a population previously established in [[Transcaucasia]]. The range of Soviet raccoons was never single or continuous, as they were often introduced to different locations far from each other. All introductions into the [[Russian Far East]] failed; melanistic raccoons were released on Petrov Island near [[Vladivostok]] and some areas of southern [[Primorsky Krai]], but died. In [[Middle Asia]], raccoons were released in [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s [[Jalal-Abad Province]], though they were later recorded as &quot;practically absent&quot; there in January 1963. A large and stable raccoon population (yielding 1000–1500 catches a year) was established in [[Azerbaijan]] after an introduction to the area in 1937. Raccoons apparently survived an introduction near [[Terek River|Terek]], along the [[Sulak River]] into the [[Dagestan]]i lowlands. Attempts to settle raccoons on the [[Kuban River]]'s left tributary and [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] were unsuccessful. A successful acclimatization occurred in [[Belarus]], where three introductions (consisting of 52, 37 and 38 individuals in 1954 and 1958) took place. By January 1, 1963, 700 individuals were recorded in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;s1380&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=1380–1383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban raccoons ===
[[File:Waschbaer auf dem Dach.jpg|thumb|On the roof of a house in Albertshausen, Germany]]

Due to its adaptability, the raccoon has been able to use [[urban area]]s as a habitat. The first sightings were recorded in a [[suburb]] of [[Cincinnati]] in the 1920s. Since the 1950s, raccoons have been present in [[metropolitan area]]s like [[Washington, DC]], [[Chicago]], and [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;untersuchungen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Frank-Uwe|last=Michler|title=Untersuchungen zur Raumnutzung des Waschbären (''Procyon lotor'', L. 1758) im urbanen Lebensraum am Beispiel der Stadt Kassel (Nordhessen)|page=7|date=June 25, 2003|url=http://www.projekt-waschbaer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Diplomarbeit-Waschbaer-Michler.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=December 7, 2008 |language=German}} (Diploma thesis at the University of Halle-Wittenberg)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2010s, a nuisance population of raccoons has been present in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/423942/news/rascally-raccoons-wreaking-havoc-across-the-duke-city.html|title=Rascally Raccoons wreak havoc across Duke City|author=Joline Gutierrez Krueger|date=2 July 2014|work=Albuquerque Journal |accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, [[Kassel]] has hosted Europe's first and densest population in a large urban area, with about 50 to 150&amp;nbsp;animals per square kilometer (130 to 390&amp;nbsp;animals per square mile), a figure comparable to those of urban habitats in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;untersuchungen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Home range sizes of urban raccoons are only 3 to 40&amp;nbsp;hectares (7.5 to 100&amp;nbsp;acres) for females and 8 to 80&amp;nbsp;hectares (20 to 200&amp;nbsp;acres) for males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stand der Wissenschaft&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projekt-waschbaer.de/stand-der-wissenschaft/|title=Stand der Wissenschaft|accessdate=December 7, 2008|last=Michler|first=Frank-Uwe|author2=Köhnemann, Berit A.|work=&quot;Projekt Waschbär&quot;|publisher=Gesellschaft für Wildökologie und Naturschutz e.V.|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small towns and suburbs, many raccoons sleep in a nearby forest after foraging in the settlement area.&lt;ref name=&quot;untersuchungen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Fruit and insects in gardens and leftovers in municipal waste are easily available food sources.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a large number of additional sleeping areas exist in these areas, such as hollows in old garden trees, cottages, garages, abandoned houses, and attics.

Some of the most important [[bacteria]]l diseases which affect raccoons are [[leptospirosis]], [[listeriosis]], [[tetanus]], and [[tularemia]]. Although internal [[parasitism|parasites]] weaken their [[immune system]]s, well-fed individuals can carry a great many roundworms in their [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tracts]] without showing symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, pp. 73–74; Zeveloff, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The larvae of the ''[[Baylisascaris procyonis]]'' roundworm, which can be contained in the feces and seldom causes a severe illness in humans, can be ingested when cleaning [[raccoon latrine]]s without wearing breathing protection.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, pp. 169, 182&lt;/ref&gt;

Since raccoons in high mortality areas have a higher rate of reproduction, extensive hunting may not solve problems with raccoon populations. Older males also claim larger home ranges than younger ones, resulting in a lower population density.

After persistent population increases began in the 1940s, the seasonal hunt reached about one million animals in 1946/47 and two million in 1962/63.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, pp. 75, 160&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcast of three television episodes about the [[Frontier#American frontier|frontiersman]] [[Davy Crockett]] and the film ''[[Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier]]'' in 1954 and 1955 led to a high demand for [[coonskin cap]]s in the United States, although it is unlikely either Crockett or the actor who played him, [[Fess Parker]], actually wore a cap made from raccoon fur.&lt;ref&gt;Zeveloff, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The seasonal hunt reached an all-time high with 5.2&amp;nbsp;million animals in 1976/77 and ranged between 3.2 and 4.7&amp;nbsp;million for most of the 1980s. In 1982, the average pelt price was $20.&lt;ref&gt;The Red Panda, Olingos, Coatis, Raccoons, and Their Relatives: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for Procyonids and Ailurids By A. R.

While primarily hunted for their fur, raccoons were also a source of food for Native Americans and early American settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, pp. 18–19, Zeveloff, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], young specimens killed without a fight are palatable, whereas old raccoons caught after a lengthy battle are inedible.&lt;ref name=&quot;seton1028&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1909|pp=1028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raccoon meat was extensively eaten during the early years of California, where it was sold in the San Francisco market for $1–3 apiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;g14&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldman|Jackson|1950|pp=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery in the United States|American slaves]] occasionally ate raccoon at [[Christmas]], but it was not necessarily a dish of the poor or rural.

=== Pet raccoons ===
Raccoons are sometimes kept as [[pet]]s, which is discouraged by many experts because the raccoon is not a [[domestication|domesticated]] species. Raccoons may act unpredictably and aggressively and it is usually impossible to teach them to obey commands.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; In places where keeping raccoons as pets is not forbidden, such as in Wisconsin and other U.S. states, an [[exotic pet]] permit may be required.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bluett|first=Robert|author2=Craven, Scott |title=The Raccoon (''Procyon lotor'')|page=2|publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System|year=1999|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/pdf/G3304.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their propensity for unruly behavior exceeds that of [[Skunks as pets|captive skunks]], and are even less trustworthy when allowed to roam freely. Because of their intelligence and nimble forelimbs, even inexperienced raccoons are easily capable of unscrewing jars, uncorking bottles and opening door latches, with more experienced specimens having been recorded to open door knobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam1884&quot; /&gt; Sexually mature raccoons often show aggressive natural behaviors such as biting during the mating season.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neutering]] them at around five or six months of age decreases the chances of aggressive behavior developing.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Raccoons can become [[obesity|obese]] and suffer from other disorders due to poor diet and lack of exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; When fed with [[cat food]] over a long time period, raccoons can develop [[gout]].&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the research results regarding their social behavior, it is now required by law in Austria and Germany to keep at least two individuals to prevent loneliness.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutachten&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gutachten über Mindestanforderungen an die Haltung von Säugetieren |url=http://www.lotor.de/download/haltung_saeugetiere.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=January 31, 2009|date=June 10, 1996|publisher=Bundesministerium für Verbraucherschutz, Ernährung und Landwirtschaft|location=Bonn, Germany|language=German|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mindestanforderungen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Mindestanforderungen an die Haltung von Säugetieren |url=http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/BgblAuth/BGBLA_2004_II_486/COO_2026_100_2_155421.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=August 21, 2010|date=December 17, 2004 |publisher=Bundesministerium für Gesundheit und Frauen|language=German|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raccoons are usually kept in a [[pen (enclosure)|pen]] (indoor or outdoor), also a legal requirement in Austria and Germany, rather than in the apartment where their natural [[curiosity]] may result in damage to property.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutachten&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mindestanforderungen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 184, 187; MacClintock, p. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;

When orphaned, it is possible for kits to be [[wildlife rehabilitation|rehabilitated]] and [[Reintroduction|reintroduced]] to the wild. However, it is uncertain whether they readapt well to life in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;MacClintock, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Feeding unweaned kits with [[cow's milk]] rather than a kitten replacement milk or a similar product can be dangerous to their health.&lt;ref&gt;Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;
