A New York City native, Reines obtained his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Political Science from [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]].&lt;ref name=parnes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0408/9641_Page2.html |title=Top Clinton hand shields Chelsea|last=Parnes|first=Amie|publisher=[[Politico.com]]|date=April 16, 2008|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===2000-2003===
Reines was a member of the [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|2000 Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign's]] rapid response operation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeff Gerth|Gerth, Jeff]]; [[Don Van Natta Jr.|Van Natta, Don]] (2007). ''[[Her Way|Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton]]''. New York: Little, Brown. ISBN 978-0-316-00784-9. Chapter 19, &quot;The Club&quot;. &quot;Working on the Gore-Lieberman 2000 presidential campaign, [Reines] honed his skills in reconnaissance, communications, and 'digging up the dirt' on the opposition.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Reines remained involved in former [[Al Gore|Vice President Gore's]] public activities after Gore left office in 2001, going on to serve as Gore's teaching assistant and de facto spokesperson at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], when Gore taught the course &quot;Covering National Affairs in the Information Age,&quot; in spring 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Jason (June&amp;nbsp;12, 2011). &quot;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/longtime-keeper-of-hillary-clintons-image-has-forged-a-loyal-badge-of-his-own/2011/05/31/AGLAu9RH_story.html Longtime keeper of Hillary Clinton’s image has forged a loyal badge of his own]&quot;. ''Washington Post''. &quot;When Gore lost and took a teaching gig at Columbia University, Reines followed, acting as his teaching assistant and de facto spokesman.&quot; Concerning the title and date of Gore's course: &quot;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/01/01/gore.html Former Vice President Al Gore to Teach at Columbia's School of Journalism]&quot; (January&amp;nbsp;25, 2001; updated September&amp;nbsp;18, 2002). ''Columbia News''. Columbia University. Retrieved 2016-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Finn-2005&quot;&gt;Finn, Robin (July&amp;nbsp;15, 2005). &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/15/nyregion/speaking-and-sweating-for-the-senator.html Speaking, and Sweating, for the Senator]&quot;. ''New York Times''. Retrieved 2016-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2002 he contributed material for Gore's appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finn-2005&quot;/&gt;

After the 2000 Presidential election was decided, Reines returned to New York and spent a year as Deputy Communications Director for the [[New York City Council]] before joining [[Peter Vallone|Speaker Peter Vallone's]] mayoral bid.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} He later worked briefly as Communications Director for U.S. Representative [[Jane Harman]] (D-CA).&lt;ref name=parnes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://bgsdc.com/team/philippe-i-reines/ Philippe Reines, Founder&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Managing Director]&quot;. Beacon Global Strategies. Retrieved 2016-10-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in July 2002 Reines served as press secretary for Hillary Rodham Clinton,&lt;ref name=&quot;Finn-2005&quot;/&gt; during her term as New York senator. Over the next several years he became an increasingly trusted adviser to Clinton, and a key adviser on Iraq issues.&lt;ref name=parnes/&gt;

In 2003, Reines helped orchestrate the media campaign and seven-month book tour that accompanied the release of ''[[Living History]]'', Senator Clinton's bestselling memoir of her time in the [[White House]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} As the primary point of contact between Senator Clinton's official office and the national press corps, Reines served as one of Senator Clinton's primary spokesmen, and was responsible for many of her interviews and media appearances.

===2008-2012===
During the 2008 Presidential Campaign, in addition to his role as press secretary and senior advisor to Hillary Clinton, he served as a spokesman for [[Chelsea Clinton]], traveling with her throughout the primaries.&lt;ref name=parnes/&gt;

When Clinton took up her post as Secretary of State, in January 2009, Reines was appointed as her senior advisor.&lt;ref name=&quot;NationalJournal&quot;/&gt; By 2010 he had been named Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marquis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StateDeptPressRelease&quot;/&gt;

A scathing piece by ''Politico'' in March 2009 highlighted Reines's responsibility for one of Clinton's early gaffes as Secretary of State&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; an erroneous Russian translation of the word &quot;Reset&quot; on a gag button presented to Clinton's Russian counterpart, [[Sergei Lavrov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Ben |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/03/reines-storm-clinton-conflict-brews-020404 |title=Reines storm: Clinton conflict brews |publisher=''Politico''. politico.com |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Reines struck a deal with journalist [[Marc Ambinder]] to provide an advance copy of a Hillary Clinton speech to Ambinder in exchange for positive reporting on Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;Trotter, J. K. (February&amp;nbsp;9, 2016). &quot;[http://gawker.com/this-is-how-hillary-clinton-gets-the-coverage-she-wants-1758019058 This Is How Hillary Clinton Gets the Coverage She Wants]&quot;.

In its December 2009 profile of Hillary Clinton, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine described him as Clinton's &quot;[[Michael Clayton (film)|Michael Clayton]]-esque image man and fixer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/feature/2009_December_Jonathan_Van_Meter_Profile_of_Hillary_Clinton/ |title=Magazine |publisher=Vogue |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, [[The Washington Post|The Washington Post's]] ''WhoRunsGov'', a site offering user-contributed political profiles, moderated by an editorial team, included a profile of Reines as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Philippe_Reines |title=Philippe Reines [user-contributed profile; moderated by Rachel Van Dongen]|website=whorunsgov.com|publisher=The Washington Post Company|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325062945/http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Philippe_Reines|archive-date=2010-03-25|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its &quot;Power 25: Press&quot; series;{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and in July 2010, ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' included Reines in their &quot;50 Politicos to Watch&quot; list, categorizing him as a &quot;fixer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=F703D2B4-18FE-70B2-A8A11B34D77CF87A|title=The Fixers|date=July 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227002244/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=F703D2B4-18FE-70B2-A8A11B34D77CF87A|publisher=''Politico''|archive-date=2012-02-27|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Reines vigorously took issue with [[CNN]] over its use of Ambassador to Libya [[J. Christopher Stevens]]'s diary, which CNN found at the site of an [[U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi|attack on the US consulate in Benghazi]] which killed the ambassador. CNN fired back by suggesting that the State Department was &quot;attacking the messenger&quot; because of &quot;questions about why the State Department didn’t do more to protect Ambassador Stevens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81563.html?hp=f3 |title=State Department: CNN 'indefensible' on late ambassador Christopher Stevens's diary - Mike Allen |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some media critics sided with CNN and questioned whether Reines' real grievance was indeed with CNN's disrespect for the privacy wishes of Stevens' family; [[BuzzFeed]] published an email exchange between Reines and [[Michael Hastings (journalist)|Michael Hastings]] where the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State told Hastings to &quot;Fuck off.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeedpolitics/hillary-clinton-aide-tells-reporter-to-fuck-off Hillary Clinton Aide Tells Reporter To &quot;Fuck Off&quot; And &quot;Have A Good Life&quot;] ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' 24 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Reines also took issue with a reporter's questions in December 2012, calling a [[Fox News]] correspondent's question about his boss &quot;absolutely asinine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Erik Wemple]] (2 January 2013), [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/01/02/fox-news-producer-was-scolded-by-state-department/ Fox News producer was scolded by State Department] ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
In the debate preparations for [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], Reines has been standing in  for Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Maggie|last1=Haberman|authorlink1=Maggie Haberman|first2=Patrick|last2=Healy|authorlink2=Patrick Healy (journalist)|date=24 September 2016|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/us/politics/hillary-clinton-aide-playing-donald-trump-in-mock-debates.html|title= Hillary Clinton Aide Playing Donald Trump in Mock Debates|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS commented that Reines is &quot;known for his bullish, combative personality--traits that often mirror Trump’s personal debate style&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-aide-playing-donald-trump-debate-prep/|title=Top Hillary Clinton aide playing Donald Trump in debate prep|last=Flores|first=Reena|date=24 September 2016|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
