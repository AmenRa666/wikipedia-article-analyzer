'''Hernán Cortés de Monroy y Pizarro Altamirano, Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca''' ({{IPA-es|erˈnaŋ korˈtes ðe monˈroj i piˈθaro}}; 1485 – December 2, 1547) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ''[[Conquistador]]'' who led an expedition that caused the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|fall of the Aztec Empire]] and brought large portions of mainland [[Mexico]] under the rule of the [[Crown of Castile|King of Castile]] in the early 16th century. Cortés was part of the generation of Spanish colonizers who began the first phase of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].

Born in [[Medellín, Spain]], to a family of lesser [[nobility]], Cortés chose to pursue a livelihood in the [[New World]]. He went to [[Hispaniola]] and later to [[Cuba]], where he received an ''[[encomienda]]'' and, for a short time, became alcalde (magistrate) of the second Spanish town founded on the island. In 1519, he was elected captain of the third expedition to the mainland, an expedition which he partly funded. His enmity with the Governor of Cuba, [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]], resulted in the recall of the expedition at the last moment, an order which Cortés ignored.

Arriving on the continent, Cortés executed a successful strategy of allying with some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] against others. He also used a native woman, [[Doña Marina]], as an [[interpreter]]; she would later bear Cortés a son. When the Governor of Cuba sent emissaries to arrest Cortés, he fought them and won, using the extra troops as reinforcements. Cortés wrote letters directly to the king asking to be acknowledged for his successes instead of punished for mutiny. After he overthrew the [[Aztec Empire]], Cortés was awarded the title of ''Marqués del Valle de [[Oaxaca]]'', while the more prestigious title of [[New Spain|Viceroy]] was given to a high-ranking nobleman, [[Antonio de Mendoza]]. In 1541 Cortés returned to Spain,  where he died peacefully but embittered, six years later.

Because of the controversial undertakings of Cortés and the scarcity of reliable sources of information about him, it has become difficult to assert anything definitive about his personality and motivations. Early lionizing of the conquistadors did not encourage deep examination of Cortés. Later reconsideration of the conquistadors' character in the context of modern anti-colonial sentiment also did little to expand understanding of Cortés as an individual. As a result of these historical trends, descriptions of Cortés tend to be simplistic, and either damning or idealizing.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
{{See also|Spanish naming customs}}

While now generally called ''Hernán'', Cortés himself used the form ''Hernando'' or ''Fernando''. All are equally correct.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the English-language version of his letters is called &quot;Hernán Cortés: Letters from Mexico&quot;, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Cortés was born in 1485 in the town of [[Medellín (Spain)|Medellín]], in modern-day [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]]. His father, Martín Cortés de Monroy, born in 1449 to Rodrigo or Ruy Fernández de Monroy and his wife María Cortés, was an [[infantry]] [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] of distinguished ancestry but slender means. Hernán's mother was Catalina Pizarro Altamirano.&lt;ref name=&quot;Machado, J. T 1970&quot;&gt;Machado, J. T. Montalvão, ''Dos Pizarros de Espanha aos de Portugal e Brasil'', Author's Edition, 1st Edition, Lisbon, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his mother, Hernán was the second cousin once removed of [[Francisco Pizarro]], who later conquered the [[Inca Empire]] of modern-day [[Peru]] (not to be confused with another Francisco Pizarro who joined Cortés to conquer the [[Aztec]]s), through her parents Diego Altamirano and wife and cousin Leonor Sánchez Pizarro Altamirano, first cousin of Pizarro's father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Machado, J. T 1970&quot;/&gt; Through his father, Hernán was a twice distant relative of [[Nicolás de Ovando]], the third [[Governor of Hispaniola]]. His paternal grandfather was a son of [[Rodrigo de Monroy y Almaraz, 5th Lord of Monroy]], and wife Mencía de Orellana y Carvajal.

Hernán Cortés is described as a pale, sickly child by his [[biographer]], [[chaplain]], and friend [[Francisco López de Gómara]]. At the age of 14, Cortés was sent to study Latin under an uncle-in-law in Salamanca.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Hernan_Cortes.aspx Hernán Cortés]&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years, Cortés, tired of schooling, returned home to Medellín, much to the irritation of his parents, who had hoped to see him equipped for a profitable legal career. However, those two years at [[Salamanca]], plus his long period of training and experience as a notary, first in Seville and later in [[Hispaniola]], would give him a close acquaintance with the legal codes of Castile that helped him to justify his unauthorized conquest of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hernan Cortés&quot;&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/imperialism/notes/cortez.html Hernan Cortés]&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point in his life, Cortés was described by Gómara as restless, haughty and mischievous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hernan Cortés&quot;/&gt; This was probably a fair description of a 16-year-old boy who had returned home only to find himself frustrated by life in his small provincial town. By this time, news of the exciting discoveries of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the New World was streaming back to Spain.

==Early career in the New World==
Plans were made for Cortés to sail to the Americas with a family acquaintance and distant relative, Nicolás de Ovando, the newly appointed [[Governor of Hispaniola]] (currently [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]), but an injury he sustained while hurriedly escaping from the bedroom of a married woman{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} from Medellín prevented him from making the journey. Instead, he spent the next year wandering the country, probably spending most of his time in Spain's southern ports of [[Cadiz]], [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]], [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda|Sanlucar]], and [[Seville]], listening to the tales of those returning from the Indies, who told of discovery and conquest, gold, Indians, and strange unknown lands.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} He finally left for Hispaniola in 1504 where he became a colonist.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, John A. The Epic of Latin America. Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 1992. 4th ed. p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival===
Cortés reached Hispaniola in a ship commanded by Alonso Quintero, who tried to deceive his superiors and reach the New World before them in order to secure personal advantages. Quintero's mutinous conduct may have served as a model for Cortés in his subsequent career. The history of the conquistadores is rife with accounts of rivalry, jockeying for positions, mutiny, and betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloquio.com/famosos/cortes.htm |title=Famous Hispanics: Hernán Cortés |publisher=Coloquio.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival in 1504 in [[Santo Domingo]], the capital of Hispaniola, the 18-year-old Cortés registered as a citizen, which entitled him to a building plot and land to farm. Soon afterwards, Nicolás de Ovando, still the governor, gave him an ''[[encomienda]]'' and made him a notary of the town of [[Azua de Compostela]]. His next five years seemed to help establish him in the colony; in 1506, Cortés took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba, receiving a large estate of land and Indian slaves for his efforts from the leader of the expedition.

===Cuba (1511–1519)===
In 1511, Cortés  accompanied [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]], an aide of the Governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. Velázquez was appointed [[Governor of New Spain]]. At the age of 26, Cortés was made clerk to the treasurer with the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown received the ''quinto'', or customary one fifth of the profits from the expedition.

The Governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez, was so impressed with Cortés that he secured a high political position for him in the colony. He became secretary for Governor Velázquez. Cortés was twice appointed municipal magistrate (''[[alcalde]]'') of [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]]. In Cuba, Cortés became a man of substance with an ''[[encomienda]]'' to provide Indian labor for his mines and cattle. This new position of power also made him the new source of leadership, which opposing forces in the colony could then turn to. In 1514, Cortés led a group which demanded that more Indians be assigned to the settlers.

As time went on, relations between Cortés and Governor Velázquez became strained.&lt;ref name=Hassig94&gt;Hassig, Ross. ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman Group UK Limited, 1994, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; This began once news of [[Juan de Grijalva]], establishing a colony on the mainland where there was a bonanza of silver and gold, reached Velázquez; it was decided to send him help. Cortés was appointed [[Captain-General]] of this new expedition in October 1518, but was advised to move fast before Velázquez changed his mind.&lt;ref name=Hassig94/&gt;

With Cortés's experience as an administrator, knowledge gained from many failed expeditions, and his impeccable rhetoric he was able to gather six ships and 300 men, within a month. Predictably, Velázquez's jealousy exploded and decided to place the leadership of the expedition in other hands. However, Cortés quickly gathered more men and ships in other Cuban ports.

Cortés also found time to become romantically involved with Catalina Xuárez (or Juárez), the sister-in-law of Governor Velázquez. Part of Velázquez's displeasure seems to have been based on a belief that Cortés was trifling with Catalina's affections. Cortés was temporarily distracted by one of Catalina's sisters but finally married Catalina, reluctantly, under pressure from Governor Velázquez. However, by doing so, he hoped to secure the good will of both her family and that of Velázquez.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson Beck, [http://www.san.beck.org/11-2-SpanishConquest.html#3 &quot;Cortès in Mexico&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until he had been almost 15 years in the Indies, that Cortés began to look beyond his substantial status as mayor of the capital of Cuba and as a man of affairs in the thriving colony. He missed the first two expeditions, under the orders of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (discoverer of Yucatán)|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]] and then [[Juan de Grijalva]], sent by Diego Velázquez to [[Mexico]] in 1518.

==Conquest of Mexico (1519–1521)==
{{Main article|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}

[[Image:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|300px|A map depicting Cortés's invasion route from the coast to the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]].]]
In 1518, Velázquez put Cortés in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of Mexico for colonization. At the last minute, due to the old argument between the two, Velázquez changed his mind and revoked Cortés's charter. He ignored the orders and, in an act of open [[mutiny]], went anyway in February 1519. He stopped in [[Trinidad, Cuba]], to hire more soldiers and obtain more horses.  Accompanied by about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses, and a small number of [[cannon]], Cortés landed on the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory.&lt;ref name=Grunberg&gt;Bernard Grunberg, ''&quot;La folle aventure d'Hernan Cortés''&quot;, in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There he encountered [[Geronimo de Aguilar]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]] priest who had survived a [[Shipwrecking|shipwreck]] followed by a period in captivity with the [[Maya peoples|Maya]], before escaping.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt; Aguilar had learned the [[Chontal Maya language]] and was able to translate for Cortés.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowe, John A 1992. p.75&quot;&gt;Crowe, John A. The Epic of Latin America. Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 1992. 4th ed. p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1519, Cortés formally claimed the land for the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish crown]].  Then he proceeded to [[Tabasco]], where he met with resistance and won a [[Potonchán#Battle of Centla|battle]] against the natives. He received twenty young indigenous women from the vanquished natives, and he converted them all to Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowe, John A 1992. p.75&quot;/&gt;

Among these women was [[La Malinche]], his future [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] and mother of his son Martín. Malinche knew both the [[Nahuatl]] language and the Chontal Maya, thus enabling Cortés to communicate with the Aztecs through Aguilar.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, ISBN 0140441239&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82,86–87}}  At [[San Juan de Ulúa]] on [[Easter Sunday]] 1519, Cortés met with [[Moctezuma II]]'s [[Aztec Empire]] governors Tendile and Pitalpitoque.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|89}}

[[File:ScuttleFleetNHMDF.JPG|thumb|250px|Cortés scuttling his own fleet off the coast of Veracruz in order to eliminate the possibility of retreat.]]
In July 1519, his men took over [[Veracruz]]. By this act, Cortés dismissed the authority of the Governor of Cuba to place himself directly under the orders of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles]].&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt; In order to eliminate any ideas of retreat, Cortés [[Scuttling|scuttled]] his ships.&lt;ref name=Longman94&gt;Hassig, Ross. ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman Group UK Limited, 1994, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

=== March on Tenochtitlan ===
In Veracruz, he met some of the tributaries of the Aztecs  and asked them to arrange a meeting with [[Moctezuma II]], the ''[[tlatoani]]'' (ruler) of the Aztec Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longman94&quot;/&gt; Moctezuma repeatedly turned down the meeting, but Cortés was determined. Leaving a hundred men in Veracruz, Cortés marched on [[Tenochtitlan]] in mid-August 1519, along with 600 soldiers, 15 horsemen, 15 [[cannon]]s, and hundreds of indigenous carriers and warriors.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt;

On the way to Tenochtitlan, Cortés made alliances with [[indigenous people of Mexico|indigenous peoples]] such as the [[Totonac]]s of [[Cempoala]] and the [[Nahua people|Nahuas]] of [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].  The [[Otomi people|Otomis]] initially, and then the [[Tlaxcalans]] fought the Spanish a series of three battles from 2 Sept. to 5 Sept. 1519, and at one point Diaz remarked, &quot;they surrounded us on every side&quot;.  After Cortés continued to release prisoners with messages of peace, and realizing the Spanish were enemies of Montezuma, [[Xicotencatl the Elder]], and [[Maxixcatzin]], persuaded the Tlaxcalan warleader, [[Xicotencatl the Younger]], that it would be better to ally with the newcomers than to kill them.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|143–155,171}}

In October 1519, Cortés and his men, accompanied by about 1,000 Tlaxcalteca,&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|188}} marched to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Cortés, either in a pre-meditated effort to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him at Tenochtitlan or (as he later claimed, when he was being investigated) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza, then partially burned the city.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|199–200}}

[[File:Cortez &amp; La Malinche.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cortés and [[La Malinche]] meet Moctezuma in Tenochtitlan, November 8, 1519.]] 
By the time he arrived in Tenochtitlan the Spaniards had a large army. On November 8, 1519, they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross. ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman Group UK Limited, 1994, pp. 82, 86&lt;/ref&gt; Moctezuma deliberately let Cortés enter the Aztec capital, the island city of [[Tenochtitlan]], hoping to get to know their weaknesses better and to crush them later.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt;

Moctezuma gave lavish gifts of gold to the Spaniards which, rather than placating them, excited their ambitions for plunder. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned at this point that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] or Quetzalcoatl himself – a belief which has been contested by a few modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew (2003). ''Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest''. Oxford University Press; Townsend, Camilla (2003). &quot;Burying the White Gods: New Perspectives on the Conquest of Mexico.&quot; American Historical Review 108, no. 3: 659–687.&lt;/ref&gt; But quickly Cortés learned that several Spaniards on the coast had been killed by Aztecs while supporting the Totonacs, and decided to take Moctezuma as a hostage in his own palace, indirectly ruling Tenochtitlán through him.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross. ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman Group UK Limited, 1994, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Velázquez sent another expedition, led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], to oppose Cortés, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt; Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narváez.  He overcame Narváez, despite his numerical inferiority, and convinced the rest of Narváez's men to join him.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt; In Mexico, one of Cortés's lieutenants [[Pedro de Alvarado]], committed the ''[[massacre in the Great Temple]]'', triggering a local rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross. ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman Group UK Limited, 1994, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortés speedily returned to Tenochtitlán. On July 1, 1520 Moctezuma was killed (the Spaniards claimed he was stoned to death by his own people; others claim he was murdered by the Spanish once they realized his inability to placate the locals). Faced with a hostile population, Cortés decided to flee for Tlaxcala. During the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'' (June 30 – July 1, 1520), the Spaniards managed a narrow escape from Tenochtitlan across the Tlacopan causeway, while their rearguard was being massacred. Much of the treasure looted by Cortés was lost (as well as his artillery) during this panicked escape from Tenochtitlán.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt;

=== Destruction of Tenochtitlan ===
After [[Battle of Otumba|a battle in Otumba]], they managed to reach Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt; With the assistance of their allies, Cortés's men finally prevailed with reinforcements arriving from [[Cuba]]. Cortés began a policy of [[attrition warfare|attrition]] towards Tenochtitlan, cutting off supplies and subduing the Aztecs' allied cities. The [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|siege of Tenochtitlán]] ended with Spanish victory and the destruction of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross. ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman Group UK Limited, 1994, pp. 108–143&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1521, Cortés countered a conspiracy against him, headed by Antonio de Villafana, who was hanged for the offense.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt; Finally, with the capture of [[Cuauhtémoc]], the ''[[tlatoani]]'' (ruler) of Tenochtitlán, on August 13, 1521, the Aztec Empire was captured, and Cortés was able to claim it for Spain, thus renaming the city [[Mexico City]]. From 1521 to 1524, Cortés personally governed Mexico.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt;

==Appointment to governorship of Mexico and internal dissensions==
[[Image:Malinche Tlaxcala.jpg|thumb|250px|A painting from [[Diego Muñoz Camargo]]'s ''[[History of Tlaxcala]]'' (Lienzo Tlaxcala), c. 1585, showing [[La Malinche]] and Hernán Cortés.]]

Many historical sources have conveyed an impression that Cortés was unjustly treated by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Crown]], and that he received nothing but ingratitude for his role in establishing [[New Spain]]. This picture is the one Cortés presents in his letters and in the later biography written by [[Francisco López de Gómara]]. However, there may be more to the picture than this. Cortés's own sense of accomplishment, entitlement, and vanity may have played a part in his deteriorating position with the king:

{{quote|Cortés personally was not ungenerously rewarded, but he speedily complained of insufficient compensation to himself and his comrades. Thinking himself beyond reach of restraint, he disobeyed many of the orders of the Crown, and, what was more imprudent, said so in a letter to the emperor, dated October 15, 1524 (Ycazbalceta, &quot;Documentos para la Historia de México&quot;, Mexico, 1858, I). In this letter Cortés, besides recalling in a rather abrupt manner that the conquest of Mexico was due to him alone, deliberately acknowledges his disobedience in terms which could not fail to create a most unfavourable impression.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04397a.htm Hernan Cortés]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles]] appointed Cortés as governor, captain general and chief justice of the newly conquered territory, dubbed &quot;[[New Spain]] of the Ocean Sea&quot;. But also, much to the dismay of Cortés, four royal officials were appointed at the same time to assist him in his governing – in effect, submitting him to close observation and administration. Cortés initiated the construction of [[Mexico City]], destroying Aztec temples and buildings and then rebuilding on the Aztec ruins what soon became the most important European city in the Americas.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt;

Cortés managed the founding of new cities and appointed men to extend Spanish rule to all of New Spain, imposing the ''[[encomienda]]'' system in 1524.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt; He reserved many encomiendas for himself and for his retinue, which they considered just rewards for their accomplishment in conquering central Mexico. However, later arrivals and members of factions antipathetic to Cortés complained of the favoritism that excluded them.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jal-ixco.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Cristóbal de Olid]] leads Spanish soldiers with [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]]n allies in the conquests of Jalisco, 1522.]]
In 1523, the Crown (possibly influenced by Cortés's enemy, [[Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]]),&lt;ref&gt;p. 30–31 of J.H. Elliot, introductory essay to Anthony Pagden's translation of Cortés's letters &quot;Hernan Cortés&quot; letters from Mexico&quot; 2001 (1971, 1986) Yale University NotaBene books&lt;/ref&gt; sent a military force under the command of [[Francisco de Garay]] to conquer and settle the northern part of Mexico, the region of [[Pánuco (province)|Pánuco]]. This was another setback for Cortés who mentioned this in his fourth letter to the King in which he describes himself as the victim of a conspiracy by his archenemies [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]], [[Diego Columbus]] and Bishop Fonseca as well as Francisco Garay. The influence of Garay was effectively stopped by this appeal to the King who sent out a decree forbidding Garay to interfere in the politics of New Spain, causing him to give up without a fight.

[[Image:Hernán Cortés (Museo del Prado).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of Cortés at [[Museo del Prado]].]]
Although Cortés had flouted the authority of Diego Velázquez in sailing to the mainland and then leading an expedition of conquest, Cortés's spectacular success was rewarded by the crown with a coat of arms, a mark of high honor, following the conqueror's request. The document granting the coat of arms summarizes Cortés's accomplishments in the conquest of Mexico. The proclamation of the king says in part &lt;blockquote&gt;We, respecting the many labors, dangers, and adventures which you underwent as stated above, and so that there might remain a perpetual memorial of you and your services and that you and your descendants might be more fully honored...it is our will that besides your coat of arms of your lineage, which you have, you may have and bear as your coat of arms, known and recognized, a shield....&lt;ref name=&quot;grant&quot;&gt;&quot;Grant of coat of arms to Hernando Cortés, 1525&quot; transcription and translation by J.

Washington DC: Library of Congress 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; The grant specifies the iconography of the coat of arms, the central portion divided into quadrants. In the upper portion, there is a &quot;black eagle with two heads on a white field, which are the arms of the empire.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grant&quot;/&gt;{{rp|43}} Below that is a &quot;golden lion on a red field, in memory of the fact that you, the said Hernando Cortés, by your industry and effort brought matters to the state described above&quot; (i.e., the conquest).&lt;ref name=&quot;grant&quot;/&gt;{{rp|43}} The specificity of the other two quadrants is linked directly to Mexico, with one quadrant showing three crowns representing the three Aztec emperors of the conquest era, [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]], [[Cuitlahuac]], and [[Cuauhtemoc]]&lt;ref name=&quot;grant&quot;/&gt;{{rp|43}} and the other showing the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.&lt;ref name=&quot;grant&quot;/&gt;{{rp|43}} Encircling the central shield are symbols of the seven city-states around the lake and their lords that Cortés defeated, with the lords &quot;to be shown as prisoners bound with a chain which shall be closed with a lock beneath the shield.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grant&quot;/&gt;{{rp|44–45}}

==Death of his First Wife and Remarriage==
[[File:Cuernavaca Palacio Cortes.JPG|left|thumb|Fortified [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cortés in Cuernavaca]]]]
Cortés's wife Catalina Súarez arrived in New Spain from sometime around summer 1522, along with her sister and brother.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cortés, and the Fall of Old Mexico,'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993, p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt;  His marriage to Catalina was at this point extremely awkward, since she was a kinswoman of governor of Cuba Diego Velázquez, whose authority Cortés had thrown off and was now his enemy.  Catalina lacked the noble title of ''doña,'' so at this point his alliance with her no longer raised his status.  Their marriage had been childless. Since Cortés had sired children with a variety of indigenous women, including a son ca. 1522 by his cultural translator, [[Doña Marina]], Cortés knew he was capable of fathering children. Cortés's only male heir at this point was illegitimate, but nonetheless named after Cortés's father, Martín Cortés. This natural son [[Martín Cortés (son of doña Marina)|Martín Cortés]] was sometimes called &quot;El Mestizo.&quot; Cortés's wife, Catalina Suárez, died under mysterious circumstances the night of November 1–2, 1522. There were accusations at the time that Cortés had murdered his wife. There was an investigation into her death, interviewing a variety of household residents and others.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Conquest'', pp. 580-82.&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation of the investigation published in the nineteenth century in Mexico and archival documents uncovered in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Conquest,'' cites documents from the ''residencia'' against Cortés published by Ignacio López Rayon, ''Documentos para la historia de Mexico,'' Mexico, 1852-3 and the documentation in the Archivo General de Indias (AGI), Justicia, leg. 220, ff. 316-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Conquest'' also included a summary of evidence found in the AGI, Justicia, leg. 224, p. 1 (f.660v-722r), which is found on p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt;  The death of Catalina Suárez had produced a scandal and a major investigation, but weathering that Cortés was now free to marry someone of high status more appropriate to his wealth and power. In 1526, he had built an imposing residence for himself, the [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cortés]] in [[Cuernavaca]], in a region close to the capital where he had extensive [[encomienda]] holdings. In 1529 he had been accorded the noble designation of ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'', but more importantly was given the noble title of Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca and married the Spanish noblewoman Doña Juana de Zúñiga. The marriage produced three children, including another son, who was also named Martín. As the first-born legitimate son, Don [[Martín Cortés, 2nd Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca|Martín Cortés]] y Zúñiga was now Cortés's heir and succeeded his father as holder of the title and estate of the [[Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555,'' Austin: University of Texas Press 1991, 145-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Cortés's legitimate daughters were Doña Maria, Doña Catalina, and Doña Juana.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Gómara, ''Cortés: The Life of the Conqueror by His Secretary,'' Ed. and trans. Lesley Byrd Simpson. Berkeley: University of California Press 1964, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cortés and the &quot;Spiritual Conquest&quot; of Mexico==
Since the conversion to Christianity of indigenous peoples was an essential and integral part of the extension of Spanish power, making formal provisions for that conversion once the military conquest was completed was an important task for Cortés.  During the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery|Catholic Church]] had seen early attempts at conversion in the Caribbean islands by Spanish friars, particularly mendicant orders.  Cortés made a request to the Spanish monarch to send [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars to Mexico to begin the daunting work of converting vast populations indigenous to Christianity. In his fourth letter to the king, Cortés pleaded for friars rather than diocesan or secular priests because those clerics were in his view a serious danger to the Indians' conversion. &lt;blockquote&gt;If these people [Indians] were now to see the affairs of the Church and the service of God in the hands of canons or other dignitaries, and saw them indulge in the vices and profanities now common in Spain, knowing that such men were the ministers of God, it would bring our Faith into much harm that I believe any further preaching would be of no avail.&lt;ref&gt;Hernán Cortés, ''Letters from Mexico'', translated and edited by A.R. Pagden. New York: Grossman Publishers, 1971, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  He wished the mendicants to be the main evangelists.  Mendicant friars did not usually have full priestly powers to perform all the sacraments needed for conversion of the Indians and growth of the neophytes in the Christian faith, so Cortés laid out a solution to this to the king. &lt;blockquote&gt;Your Majesty should likewise beseech His Holiness [the pope] to grant these powers to the two principal persons in the religious orders that are to come here, and that they should be his delegates, one from the Order of St. Francis and the other from the Order of St. Dominic. They should bring the most extensive powers Your Majesty is able to obtain, for, because these lands are so far from the Church of Rome, and we, the Christians who now reside here and shall do so in the future, are so far from the proper remedies of our consciences and, as we are human, so subject to sin, it is essential that His Holiness should be generous with us and grant to these persons most extensive powers, to be handed down to persons actually in residence here whether it be given to the general of each order or to his provincials.&lt;ref&gt;Hernán Cortés, ''Letters from Mexico'', translated and edited by A.R. Pagden. New York: Grossman Publishers, 1971,p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Franciscans arrived in May 1524, a symbolically powerful group of twelve known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico]], led by Fray [[Martín de Valencia]].  Franciscan [[Geronimo de Mendieta]] claimed that Cortés's most important deed was the way he met this first group of Franciscans. The conqueror himself was said to have met the friars as they approached the capital, kneeling at the feet of the friars who had walked from the coast. This story was used by Franciscans as a demonstration of Cortés's piety and humility was a powerful message to all, including the Indians, that Cortés's earthly power was subordinate to the spiritual  power of the friars. However, one of the first twelve Franciscans, Fray [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]] does not mention it in his history.&lt;ref&gt;John Leddy Phelan, ''The Millennial Kingdom of the Franciscans in the New World,'' chapter 3, &quot;Hernán Cortés, the Moses of the New World,&quot; Berkeley: University of California Press, second edition, revised, 1971, pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Cortés and the Franciscans had a particularly strong alliance in Mexico, with Franciscans seeing him as &quot;the new Moses&quot; for conquering Mexico and opening it to Christian evangelization. In Motolinia's 1555 response to Dominican [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], he praises Cortés. &lt;blockquote&gt;And as to those who murmur against the Marqués del Valle [Cortés], God rest him, and who try to blacken and obscure his deeds, I believe that before God their deeds are not as acceptable as those of the Marqués.  Although as a human he was a sinner, he had faith and works of a good Christian, and a great desire to employ his life and property in widening and augmenting the fair of Jesus Christ, and dying for the conversion of these gentiles... Who has loved and defended the Indians of this new world like Cortés?... Through this captain, God opened the door for us to preach his holy gospel and it was he who caused the Indians to revere the holy sacraments and respect the ministers of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, &quot;The Franciscan reply (to the Dominicans) in ''Letters and People of the Spanish Indies, Sixteenth Century,'' translated and edited by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and Enrique Otte. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976 pp. 244-246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]]'s 1585 revision of the conquest narrative first codified as Book XII of the [[Florentine Codex]], there are laudatory references to Cortés that do not appear in the earlier text from the indigenous perspective. Whereas Book XII of the Florentine Codex concludes with an account of Spaniards' search for gold, in Sahagún's 1585 revised account, he ends with praise of Cortés for requesting the Franciscans be sent to Mexico to convert the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardino de Sahagún, ''Conquest of New Spain, 1585 Revision,'' translated by Howard F. Cline. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expedition to Honduras and aftermath==
{{see also|Spanish conquest of Yucatán#Hernán Cortés in the Maya lowlands, 1524–25|Spanish conquest of Honduras}}
From 1524 to 1526, Cortés headed an expedition to [[Honduras]] where he defeated [[Cristóbal de Olid]], who had claimed Honduras as his own under the influence of the Governor of Cuba Diego Velázquez. Fearing that [[Cuauhtémoc]] might head an insurrection in Mexico, he brought him with him to Honduras. In a controversial move, Cuauhtémoc was executed during the journey. Raging over Olid's treason, Cortés issued a decree to arrest Velázquez, whom he was sure was behind Olid's treason. This, however, only served to further estrange the [[Crown of Castile]] and the [[Council of Indies]], both of which were already beginning to feel anxious about Cortés's rising power.&lt;ref&gt;p34 of J.H. Elliot, introductory essay to Anthony Pagdens translation of Cortés' letters &quot;Hernan Cortés&quot; letters from Mexico&quot; 2001 (1971, 1986) Yale University NotaBene books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hernando Cortes crest from Charles V.jpg|thumb|The [[coat of arms]] awarded to Cortés, by King/[[Emperor Charles V]].]]
Cortés's fifth letter to King Charles attempts to justify his conduct, concludes with a bitter attack on &quot;various and powerful rivals and enemies&quot; who have &quot;obscured the eyes of your Majesty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7IGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA484&amp;hl=ca|title=''Cartas y relaciones de Hernan Cortés al emperador Carlos V'' |publisher=Everything2.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-26|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles, who was also [[Holy Roman Emperor]], had little time for distant colonies (much of Charles's reign was taken up with [[Italian Wars|wars with France]], the [[Schmalkaldic League|German Protestants]] and the expanding [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman Empire]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Charles%20V |title=Charles V |publisher=Everything2.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; except insofar as they contributed to finance his wars. In 1521, year of the Conquest, Charles was attending to matters in his German domains and Bishop [[Adrian of Utrecht]] functioned as regent in Spain.

Velázquez and Fonseca persuaded the regent to appoint a commissioner with powers, (a ''[[Juez de residencia]]'', [[Luis Ponce de León (governor of New Spain)|Luis Ponce de León]]), to investigate Cortés's conduct and even arrest him. Cortés was once quoted as saying that it was &quot;more difficult to contend against (his) own countrymen than against the Aztecs.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Governor Diego Velázquez continued to be a thorn in his side, teaming up with Bishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, chief of the Spanish colonial department, to undermine him in the Council of the Indies.

A few days after Cortés's return from his expedition, Ponce de León suspended Cortés from his office of governor of New Spain. The [[Licentiate]] then fell ill and died shortly after his arrival, appointing [[Marcos de Aguilar]] as ''alcalde mayor''. The aged Aguilar also became sick and appointed [[Alonso de Estrada]] governor, who was confirmed in his functions by a royal decree in August 1527. Cortés, suspected of poisoning them, refrained from taking over the government.

Estrada sent Diego de Figueroa to the south. De Figueroa raided graveyards and extorted contributions, meeting his end when the ship carrying these treasures sank. Albornoz persuaded Alonso de Estrada to release Salazar and Chirinos. When Cortés complained angrily after one of his adherents' hands was cut off, Estrada ordered him exiled. Cortés sailed for Spain in 1528 to appeal to King Charles.

===First return to Spain (1528) and Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca===
[[Image:Jakob Seisenegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''Emperor Charles V with Hound'' (1532), a painting by the 16th-century artist [[Jakob Seisenegger]].]]
In 1528, Cortés returned to Spain to appeal to the justice of his master, Charles V. Juan Altamirano and [[Alonso Valiente]] stayed in Mexico and acted as Cortés' representatives during his absence. Cortés presented himself with great splendor before Charles V's court. By this time Charles had returned and Cortés forthrightly responded to his enemy's charges. Denying he had held back on gold due the crown, he showed that he had contributed more than the quinto (one-fifth) required. Indeed, he had spent lavishly to build the new capital of Mexico City on the ruins of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán, leveled during the siege that brought down the Aztec empire.

He was received by Charles with every distinction, and decorated with the [[order of Santiago]]. In return for his efforts in expanding the still young [[Spanish Empire]], Cortés was rewarded in 1529 by being accorded the noble title of ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'' but more importantly named the ''&quot;Marqués del Valle de [[Oaxaca]]&quot;'' [[Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca]] and married the Spanish noblewoman, Doña Juana Zúñiga, after the 1522 death of his much less distinguished first wife, Catalina Suárez.  The noble title and senorial estate of the Marquesado was passed down to his descendants until 1811. The Oaxaca Valley was one of the wealthiest region of New Spain, and Cortés had 23,000 [[vassal]]s in 23 named [[encomiendas]] in perpetuity.&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991, pp.146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Although confirmed in his land holdings and vassals, he was not reinstated as governor and was never again given any important office in the administration of New Spain. During his travel to Spain, his property was mismanaged by abusive colonial administrators. He sided with local natives in a lawsuit. The natives documented the abuses in the [[Huexotzinco Codex]].

The entailed estate and title passed to his legitimate son Don [[Martín Cortés, 2nd Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca|Martín Cortés]] upon Cortés's death in 1547, who became the Second Marquis. Don Martín's association with the so-called Encomenderos' Conspiracy endangered the entailed holdings, but they were restored and remained the continuing reward for Hernán Cortés's family through the generations.

===Return to Mexico===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
[[Image:Hernan Fernando Cortes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hernán Cortés Monroy, with his coat of arms on the upper left corner. Painting reproduced in the book America, (R. Cronau 19th century).]]
Cortés returned to Mexico in 1530 with new titles and honors, but with diminished power. Although Cortés still retained military authority and permission to continue his conquests, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] was appointed in 1535 to administer New Spain's civil affairs.  This division of power led to continual dissension, and caused the failure of several enterprises in which Cortés was engaged.

On returning to Mexico, Cortés found the country in a state of [[anarchy]]. There was a strong suspicion in court circles of an intended rebellion by Cortés, and a charge was brought against him that cast a fatal blight upon his character and plans. He was accused of murdering his first wife. The proceedings of the investigation were kept secret.

No report, either exonerating or condemning Cortés, was published. Had the Government declared him innocent, it would have greatly increased his popularity. Had it declared him a criminal, a crisis would have been precipitated by the accused and his party. Silence was the only safe policy, but that silence is suggestive that grave danger was feared from his influence.

After reasserting his position and reestablishing some sort of order, Cortés retired to his estates at [[Cuernavaca]], about 30 miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) south of Mexico City. There he concentrated on the building of his palace and on Pacific exploration. Remaining in Mexico between 1530 and 1541, Cortés quarreled with [[Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán]] and disputed the right to explore the territory that is today [[California]] with [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the first viceroy.

Cortes acquired several silver mines in [[Zumpango del Rio]] in 1534.  By the early 1540s, he owned 20 silver mines in [[Sultepec]], 12 in [[Taxco]], and 3 in [[Zacualpan, State of Mexico|Zacualpan]].  Earlier, Cortes had claimed the silver in the [[Tamazula de Gordiano|Tamazula]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bakewell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=West,Robert.

In 1536, Cortés explored the northwestern part of Mexico and discovered the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. Cortés also spent time exploring the Pacific coast of Mexico. The [[Gulf of California]] was originally named the ''Sea of Cortes'' by its discoverer [[Francisco de Ulloa]] in 1539. This was the last major expedition by Cortés.

==Later life and death==

===Second return to Spain===
After his exploration of Baja California, Cortés returned to Spain in 1541, hoping to confound his angry civilians, who had brought many lawsuits against him (for debts, abuse of power, etc.).&lt;ref name=Grunberg/&gt;

On his return he was utterly neglected, and could scarcely obtain an audience. On one occasion he forced his way through a crowd that surrounded the emperor's carriage, and mounted on the footstep. The emperor, astounded at such audacity, demanded of him who he was. &quot;I am a man,&quot; replied Cortés proudly, &quot;who has given you more provinces than your ancestors left you cities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;virtualology1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualology.com/virtualmuseumofhistory/hallofexplorers/HERNANDOCORTES.COM/ |title=Hernán Cortés |publisher=Virtualology.com |date=2001-04-02 |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://students.ou.edu/P/Kathryn.R.Pruitt-1/spanishtreasure.html |title=spanishtreasure |publisher=Students.ou.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808111913/http://students.ou.edu/P/Kathryn.R.Pruitt-1/spanishtreasure.html |archivedate=8 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expedition against Algiers===
{{Main article|Algiers expedition (1541)}}

[[Image:Cortes-Hernan-LOC.jpg|thumb|An engraving of a middle aged Cortés by 19th-century artist William Holl.]]
The emperor finally permitted Cortés to join him and his fleet commanded by [[Andrea Doria]] at the great expedition against [[Algiers]] in the [[Barbary Coast]] in 1541, which was then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and was used as a base by [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], a famous Turkish corsair and Admiral-in-Chief of the Ottoman Fleet. During this unfortunate campaign, which was his last, Cortés was almost drowned in a storm that hit his fleet while he was pursuing Barbarossa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sandra Arlinghaus |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~sarhaus/larimore02/suleiman.html |title=Naval Battle of Preveza, 1538 |publisher=Personal.umich.edu|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years, death, and remains===
Having spent a great deal of his own money to finance expeditions, he was now heavily in debt. In February 1544 he made a claim on the royal treasury, but was ignored for the next three years. Disgusted, he decided to return to Mexico in 1547. When he reached Seville, he was stricken with [[dysentery]]. He died in [[Castilleja de la Cuesta]], [[Seville]] province, on December 2, 1547, from a case of [[pleurisy]] at the age of 62.

Like [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]], he died a wealthy but embittered man.{{clarify|post-text=See [[Talk:Hernán Cortés#Narrative confusion|talk page]].|date=December 2013}} He left his many [[mestizo]] and white children well cared for in his will, along with every one of their mothers. He requested in his will that his remains eventually be buried in Mexico. Before he died he had the Pope remove the &quot;natural&quot; status of four of his children (legitimizing them in the eyes of the church), including [[Martín Cortés (son of doña Marina)|Martin]], the son he had with Doña Marina (also known as La Malinche), said to be his favourite.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. His daughter, Doña Catalina, however, died shortly after her father's death.

After his death his body has been moved more than eight times for several reasons. On December 4, 1547 he was buried in the [[mausoleum]] of the Duke of Medina in the church of San Isidoro del Campo, Sevilla. Three years later (1550) due to the space being required by the duke, his body was moved to the altar of Santa Catarina in the same church. In his testament, Cortés asked for his body to be buried in the monastery he had ordered to be built in Coyoacan in México, ten years after his death, but the monastery was never built. So in 1566, his body was sent to New Spain and buried in the church of  &quot;San Francisco de Texcoco&quot;, where his mother and one of his sisters were buried.

In 1629, ''Don Pedro Cortés fourth &quot;Marquez del Valle'', his last male descendant, died, so the viceroy decided to move the bones of Cortés along with those of his descendant to the Franciscan church in México. This was delayed for nine years, while his body stayed in the main room of the palace of the viceroy. Eventually it was moved to the Sagrario of  Franciscan church, where it stayed for 87 years. In 1716, it was moved to another place in the same church. In 1794, his bones were moved to the &quot;[[Hospital de Jesús Nazareno|Hospital de Jesus]]&quot; (founded by Cortés), where a statue by Tolsa and a mausoleum were made. There was a public ceremony and all the churches in the city rang their bells.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[File:1000 pesetas, 12 de octubre de 1992, Hernán Cortés.jpg|thumb|300px|1000 Spanish pesetas]]
In 1823, after the independence of México, it seemed imminent that his body would be desecrated, so the mausoleum was removed, the statue and the coat of arms were sent to [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], to be protected by the Duke of Terranova. The bones were hidden, and everyone thought that they had been sent out of México. In 1836, his bones were moved to another place in the same building.

It was not until November 24, 1946 that they were rediscovered,&lt;ref name=&quot;Keen&quot;&gt;Benjamin Keen, '' The Aztecs Image in Western Thought'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|467}} thanks to the discovery of a secret document by [[Lucas Alamán]]. His bones were put in charge of the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] (INAH). The remains were authenticated by INAH.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|468}} They were then restored to the same place, this time with a bronze inscription and his coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motecuhzoma.de/huesos.html |title=Xavier López Medellín: Los huesos de Hernán Cortés |publisher=Motecuhzoma.de |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the bones were first rediscovered, the supporters of the Hispanic tradition in Mexico were excited, but one supporter of an indigenist vision of Mexico &quot;proposed that the remains be publicly burned in front of the statue of Cuauhtemoc, and the ashes flung into the air.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|468}} Following the discovery and authentication of Cortés's remains, there was a discovery of what were described as the bones of [[Cuauhtémoc]] occurred, resulting in the so-called &quot;battle of the bones&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keen&quot;/&gt;{{rp|468}} In 1981, when a copy of the bust by Tolsa was put in the church, there was a failed attempt to destroy his bones.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Disputed interpretation of his life==
There are relatively few sources to the early life of Cortés; his fame arose from his participation in the conquest of Mexico and it was only after this that people became interested in reading and writing about him.

Probably the best source is his letters to the king which he wrote during the campaign in Mexico, but they are written with the specific purpose of putting his efforts in a favourable light and so must be read critically. Another main source is the biography written by Cortés's private chaplain [[Lopez de Gómara]], which was written in Spain several years after the conquest. Gómara never set foot in the Americas and knew only what Cortés had told him, and he had an affinity for knightly romantic stories which he incorporated richly in the biography. The third major source is written as a reaction to what its author calls &quot;the lies of Gomara&quot;, the eyewitness account written by the Conquistador [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] does not paint Cortés as a [[romantic hero]] but rather tries to emphasize that Cortés's men should also be remembered as important participants in the undertakings in Mexico.

In the years following the conquest more critical accounts of the Spanish arrival in Mexico were written. The [[Dominican friar]] [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] wrote his ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'' which raises strong accusations of brutality and heinous violence towards the Indians; accusations against both the conquistadors in general and Cortés in particular.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/515/ |title = Mirror of the Cruel and Horrible Spanish Tyranny Perpetrated in the Netherlands, by the Tyrant, the Duke of Alba, and Other Commanders of King Philip II |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1620 |accessdate = 2013-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The accounts of the conquest given in the [[Florentine Codex]] by the Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and his native informants are also less than flattering towards Cortés. The scarcity of these sources has led to a sharp division in the description of Cortés's personality and a tendency to describe him as either a vicious and ruthless person or a noble and honorable cavalier.

===Representations in México===
[[Image:Monumento de Moctezuma y Hernan Cortés.jpg|thumb|230px|Monument in [[Mexico City]] commemorating the encounter of Cortés and Moctezuma at the Hospital de Jesús Nazareno.]]
In México there are few representations of Cortés. However, many landmarks still bear his name, from the castle in the city of Cuernavaca to some street names throughout the republic.

The only authentic monuments are in Mexico City at the pass between the volcanoes [[Iztaccíhuatl]] and [[Popocatépetl]] where Cortés took his soldiers on their march to Mexico City. It is known as the [[Paso de Cortés]].

The [[mural]]ist [[Diego Rivera]] painted several representation of him but the most famous, depicts him as a powerful and ominous figure along with Malinche in a mural in the National Palace in Mexico City.

In 1981, President [[Lopez Portillo]] tried to bring Cortés to public recognition. First, he made public a copy of the bust of Cortés made by [[Manuel Tolsá]] in the [[Hospital de Jesús Nazareno]] with an official ceremony, but soon a nationalist group tried to destroy it, so it had to be taken out of the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;letraslibres1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letraslibres.com/index.php?art=9040 |title=Reconocer a Cortés por Leonardo Tarifeño |publisher=Letras Libres |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the copy of bust is in the &quot;Hospital de Jesús Nazareno&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutastranquilas.blogspot.com/2011_01_01_archive.html |title=Recuerdos de España en Mexico: Hernán Cortes |date=2003-02-05 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the original is in Naples, Italy, in the Villa Pignatelli.

Later, another monument, known as &quot;Monumento al Mestizaje&quot; by Julián Martínez y M. Maldonado (1982) was commissioned by Mexican president José López Portillo to be put in the &quot;Zócalo&quot; (Main square) of Coyoacan, near the place of his country house, but it had to be removed to a little known park, the Jardín Xicoténcatl, Barrio de San Diego Churubusco, to quell protests. The statue depicts Cortés, [[Malinche]] and their son Martín.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manuel M.

There is another statue by Sebastián Aparicio, in Cuernavaca, was in a hotel &quot;El casino de la selva&quot;. Cortés is barely recognizable, so it sparked little interest. The hotel was closed to make a commercial center, and the statue was put out of public display by Costco the builder of the commercial center.&lt;ref name=&quot;letraslibres1&quot;/&gt;

===Cultural depictions===
[[File:Lorenzo Ferrero - Scene from the opera La Conquista.jpg|thumb|240px|Scene from the opera ''[[La Conquista (opera)|La Conquista]]'', 2005]]
Hernán Cortés is a character in the opera ''[[La Conquista (opera)|La Conquista]]'' (2005) by Italian composer [[Lorenzo Ferrero]], which depicts the major episodes of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] in 1521.

===Writings: the ''Cartas de Relación''===
Cortés' personal account of the conquest of Mexico is narrated in his five letters addressed to Charles V. These five letters, the ''cartas de relación'', are Cortés' only surviving writings. See &quot;Letters and Dispatches of Cortés&quot;, translated by George Folsom (New York, 1843); Prescott's &quot;Conquest of Mexico&quot; (Boston, 1843); and Sir Arthur Helps's &quot;Life of Hernando Cortes&quot; (London, 1871).&lt;ref name=&quot;virtualology1&quot;/&gt;

As one specialist describes them:
{{quote|The ''Cartas de relación'' have enjoyed an unequaled popularity among students of the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Conquest of Mexico]]. Cortés was a good writer. His letters to the emperor, on the conquest, deserve to be classed among the best Spanish documents of the period. They are, of course, coloured so as to place his own achievements in relief, but, withal, he keeps within bounds and does not exaggerate, except in matters of Indian civilization and the numbers of population as implied by the size of the settlements. Even there he uses comparatives only, judging from outward appearances and from impressions.

[[Historian]]s, [[sociologist]]s and [[political scientist]]s use them to glean information about the Aztec Empire and the clash between the European and Indian cultures. However, as early as the 16th century doubt has been cast on the historicity of these Conquest accounts. It is generally accepted that Cortés does not write a true &quot;history&quot;, but rather combines history with fiction. That is to say, in his narrative Cortés manipulates reality in order to achieve his overarching purpose of gaining the favor of the king. Cortés applies the classical rhetorical figure of evidentia as he crafts a powerful narrative full of &quot;vividness&quot; that moves the reader and creates a heightened sense of realism in his letters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}}}

His first letter is lost, and the one from the municipality of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] has to take its place. It was published for the first time in volume IV of &quot;Documentos para la Historia de España&quot;, and subsequently reprinted. The first ''carta de relación'' is available online at the University of Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/IbrAmerTxt/IbrAmerTxt-idx?type=header&amp;byte=1042389&amp;q1=&amp;q2=&amp;q3= |title=Ibero-American Electronic Text Series: Los Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda: Contents |publisher=Digicoll.library.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Segunda Carta de Relacion'', bearing the date of October 30, 1520, appeared in print at [[Seville]] in 1522. The [[Third letter of Hernán Cortés to the Emperor Charles V|third letter]], dated May 15, 1522, appeared at Seville in 1523. The fourth, October 20, 1524, was printed at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1525. The fifth, on the Honduras expedition, is contained in volume IV of the ''Documentos para la Historia de España''. The important letter mentioned in the text has been published under the heading of ''Carta inédita de Cortés'' by Ycazbalceta. A great number of minor documents, either by Cortés or others, for or against him, are dispersed through the voluminous collection above cited and through the ''Colección de Documentos de Indias'', as well as in the ''Documentos para la Historia de México'' of Ycazbalceta. There are a number of reprints and translations of Cortés's writings into various languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coloquio.com/famosos/cortes.htm |title=Hernán Cortés (1485–1547), Conqueror, Spain |author= |year=2006 |work= Famous Hispanics |publisher= Coloquio |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04397a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Hernando Cortes |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
