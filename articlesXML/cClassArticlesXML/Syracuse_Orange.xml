==Notable non-varsity sports==

===Wrestling===

Wrestling became a varsity level sport almost immediately after being introduced. The team was successful{{according to whom|date=April 2013}} and, led by Gene Mills, had two undefeated seasons in 1979 and 1981, two NCAA championships, and went on to the Olympics and Wrestling Hall of Fame.

Led by Mills at the coaching helm, The Orange won a combination of 17 individual titles (Dake, Campbell, Herbst, Ness, Visconti, Langston, Young, Hudson, Pasquale, Ryder)

===Baseball===
[[File:SU-baseball-1888.jpg|thumb|300px|Syracuse University baseball team, the &quot;Ball Nine&quot;, 1888 (courtesy SU Archives)]]
{{main article|Syracuse Orange baseball}}

Syracuse's club baseball team was established in 1979 and has been successful in tournaments.  The sport is currently played at the club level and the team is part of the National Club Baseball Association ([[National Club Baseball Association|NCBA]]).

Many students, alumni, citizens and other baseball enthusiasts in the area are in favor of an NCAA varsity team being formed on campus, but the athletic budget is a difficult barrier.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In a September 12, 2006, story in ''[[The Daily Orange]]'', Michael Wasylenko, chairman of the Athletic Policy Board, said Title IX and Syracuse's athletic budget is still a major crutch. &quot;If we added a men's sport, we'd have to get rid of a men's sport . . . And that's probably not a good idea.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Men's ice hockey===
Men's hockey competes at the [[ACHA]] Division I level in the [[Northeast Collegiate Hockey League]]. The school expressed interest in having a men's ice hockey team in the future, but these plans are on hold, in part because of [[Title IX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegehockeynews.com/news/2008/03/06_syracuse.php|title=Syracuse Women Joining CHA; No Men's Hockey Soon|first=Adam|last=Wodon|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Manley Field House}}

Built in 1962, this complex houses many of the offices of SU Athletics including the Equipment Room. It also contains academic rooms and two weight rooms strictly for Syracuse athletes only.  Adjacent to the complex there are a variety of fields used for softball, [[Syracuse Orange (Soccer)|soccer]], field hockey, as well as a track for the track and field team. Manley was initially used as an indoor training facility for the football team, as well as a home court for men's basketball. Its [[seating capacity]], 9,500, for basketball, at the time among the largest campus facilities in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], supported the rise to national prominence of the men's basketball program. The team shifted to the Carrier Dome after the 1980 season. In the final men's basketball game played at Manley, [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] snapped the Orangemen's 57 game home winning streak.

===Carmelo Anthony Basketball Center===
{{Main article|Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center}}

===Historic===

====Archbold Stadium====
[[File:Syracuse-university archibald.jpg|thumb|right|Archbold Stadium]]
Thanks to a $600,000 gift by Syracuse University trustee and Standard Oil President, [[John D. Archbold]], what was publicized as the &quot;Greatest Athletic Arena in America&quot; opened in 1907. Designed to resemble the Roman [[Colosseum]] and to never become outdated, Archbold Stadium became a trademark of Syracuse football. The stadium formed a massive [[concrete]] oval, 670 feet (204 m) long and 475 feet (145 m) wide. It was 100 feet (30 m) longer and only 22 feet (7 m) thinner than the Carrier Dome, and more than 6 million Orangemen football fans passed through its gates.

From 1907 until 1978, Archbold Stadium was the home of SU football. Archbold opened up with a bang when the Orange defeated Hobart 28–0. It went out in style 71 years later, with an improbable victory over second-ranked Navy 20–17. Syracuse posted a record of 265–112–50 at Archbold, and it housed many great teams. It was home of the 1915 squad, which was invited to play in the prestigious Rose Bowl and outscored its opponents 331 to 16. The 1959 team also called Archbold home ''en route'' to SU's only National Championship.

In 1978, SU fans said good-bye forever to the historic stadium. Archbold was demolished to make way for the new on-campus facility, the [[Carrier Dome]], which opened in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;Source: SU Athletics&quot;&gt;(Source: SU Athletics)&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCAA does not recognize Syracuse and Coach Roy Simmons Jr.'s 3–0 record, and Paul Gait's 7 goals, 7 assists and his participation in that championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaasports.com/lacrosse/mens/history |title=NCAA.com – The Official Website of NCAA Championships |publisher=Ncaasports.com |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; Syracuse and Lehigh claim 1920 title based on winning their USILL divisions. No title game played. Syracuse-Lehigh game won by Lehigh.

==Nicknames, mascots and colors==
[[Orange (color)|Orange]] is the official school color, adopted as such in 1890. Prior to that time, the school's colors were rose pink and pea green. Orange, blue, and white are traditionally used for athletic uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.edu/aboutsu/chronology/1870.html Syracuse University website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020093352/http://www.syracuse.edu/aboutsu/chronology/1870.html |date=October 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The athletic nickname derives from the official color. Prior to 2004, the official nicknames of the athletic teams were the &quot;Orangemen&quot; and &quot;Orangewomen.&quot; These former nicknames are still affectionately used by some fans. However, beginning with the 2004–2005 school year, the official nickname was changed to the &quot;Orange.&quot; This revision is [[gender-neutral language|gender-neutral]], concise, and reflects the basis of the nickname as being the school color, as opposed to being derived from the [[Orange Institution|Irish and Scottish Protestant fraternal organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dartreview.com/archives/2004/06/01/the_week_in_review.php Dartmouth Review article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007204747/http://dartreview.com/archives/2004/06/01/the_week_in_review.php |date=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nicknames over the years have included the &quot;Hilltoppers,&quot; for the school's location on a hill, and the &quot;Saltine Warriors,&quot; for a former mascot.

===Mascot===
In 1931, a Native American warrior known as Nathan March aka: &quot;Saltine Warrior&quot; became the athletic mascot. The name derived from an article describing an archaeological dig on campus allegedly uncovering the artifacts of a Native American warrior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.edu/aboutsu/chronology/1931.html Syracuse University website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211051311/http://www.syracuse.edu/aboutsu/chronology/1931.html |date=February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrior was called the &quot;Saltine Warrior&quot; because of the abundant salt deposits in the [[Syracuse, New York]] area. The article was later revealed to be a hoax, but the mascot remained for next four decades.

In the mid-1950s, the father of a [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity brother owned a cheerleading camp. He made a Saltine Warrior costume for his son to wear at Syracuse football games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse University website&quot;&gt;[http://www.syracuse.edu/aboutsu/memorabilia/mascot.html Syracuse University website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107025236/http://www.syracuse.edu/aboutsu/memorabilia/mascot.html |date=November 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus began a nearly forty-year tradition of Lambda Chi brothers serving as the university's mascot.

In 1978, the Saltine Warrior was banned by the university as part of the [[Native American mascot controversy|national movement]] to eliminate Native American motifs, becoming one of the first colleges to do so. The mascot briefly morphed into a Roman warrior, but was eventually replaced unofficially in 1982 by a giant, cartoon-style Orange.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse University website&quot;/&gt;

====Otto the Orange====

The cheerleaders and mascots were at a UCA Cheerleading Camp in Tennessee that summer, and narrowed the field down to two potential names—&quot;Opie&quot; and &quot;Otto.&quot; Figuring the name &quot;Opie&quot; would lead to the inevitable rhyme with &quot;dopey,&quot; they settled on &quot;Otto.&quot; Later that fall, word got out that the cheerleaders were calling the latest mascot costume Otto, and the name stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suathletics.com/Sports/gen/2001/mascot.asp |title=Syracuse University Athletics - SU's Mascot |publisher=Suathletics.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailyorange.com/media/storage/paper522/news/2007/04/02/Opinion/Letter.To.The.Editor.otto.The.Orange.Coined.In.1992-2816913.shtml |accessdate=April 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203071819/http://media.www.dailyorange.com/media/storage/paper522/news/2007/04/02/Opinion/Letter.To.The.Editor.otto.The.Orange.Coined.In.1992-2816913.shtml |title=Letter to the editor: 'Otto the Orange' coined in 1992 |archivedate=December 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto the Orange was adopted by the university in 1995 as the university's official mascot, selected over a wolf and a lion also under consideration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse University website&quot;/&gt;
