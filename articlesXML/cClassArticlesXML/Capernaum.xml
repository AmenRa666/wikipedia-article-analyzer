[[File:Ancient synagogue remains.JPG|thumb|Capernaum's 4th-century synagogue (detail with columns and benches)]]

The village was inhabited continuously from the 2nd century BCE to the 11th century CE, when it was abandoned sometime before the [[First Crusade|Crusader conquest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Avni&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Byzantine-Islamic Transition in Palestine: An Archaeological Approach |series=Oxford Studies in Byzantium |author=Gideon Avni |year=2014 |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=88–89 |isbn=9780199684335 |quote= |url= }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 April 2016 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the re-establishment of the village during the Early Islamic period soon after the [[749 Galilee earthquake|749 earthquake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Avni&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Kfar Nahum'', the original name of the small town, means &quot;Nahum's village&quot; in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but apparently there is no connection with the [[prophet]] named [[Nahum]]. In the writings of [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]], the name is rendered in [[Greek language|Greek]] as {{lang|grc|Kαφαρναούμ}}, ''Kapharnaum'' (Tzaferis, 1989), and {{lang|grc|Κεφαρνωκόν}}, &quot;Kepharnōkon&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;tufts&quot;/&gt; the New Testament uses ''Kapharnaum'' in some manuscripts, and {{lang|grc|Kαπερναούμ}}, ''Kapernaum'', in others. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], it is called ''Talhum'', and it is assumed that this refers to the ruin (''[[tell]]'') of ''Hum'' (perhaps an abbreviated form of ''Nahum'') (Tzaferis, 1989).

==New Testament==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Healing of the Lepers at Capernaum (Guérison des lépreux à Capernaum) - James Tissot - overall.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Tissot]] - Healing of the Lepers at Capernaum (Guérison des lépreux à Capernaum) - [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

The town is cited in all four gospels ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 4:13, 8:5, 11:23, 17:24}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark 1:21, 2:1, 9:33}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke 4:23, 31,7:1, 10:15}}, {{Bibleref2|John 2:12, 4:46, 6:17, 24,59}}) where it was reported to have been near the hometown of the [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter]], [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], as well as the [[tax collector]] [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]. One [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], Jesus taught in the synagogue in Capernaum and healed a man who was possessed by an [[devil|unclean spirit]] ({{Bibleref2|Luke 4:31–36}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark 1:21–28}}). This story is notable for being the only one common between the gospels of Mark and Luke, but not contained in the Gospel of Matthew (see [[Synoptic Gospels]] for more literary comparison between the gospels). Afterwards, he healed Simon Peter's mother-in-law of a fever ({{Bibleref2|Luke 4:38-39}}). According to {{Bibleref2|Luke 7:1–10}}, it is also the place where [[Jesus]] healed the servant of a [[Centurion (Roman army)|Roman centurion]] who had asked for his help. Capernaum is also mentioned in {{Bibleref2|Matthew 9:1–8}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark 2:1–12}}, and {{Bibleref2|Luke 5:17–26}} as the location of the famous [[Healing the paralytic at Capernaum|healing of the paralytic]] lowered through the roof to reach Jesus.

According to the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus selected this town as the center of his public ministry in the Galilee after he left the small mountainous hamlet of [[Nazareth]] ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 4:12–17}}).  He also formally [[woes to the unrepentant cities|cursed the city]], saying &quot;you will be thrown down to [[Hades]]!&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 11:23}}) because of their lack of faith in him as the [[Messiah#Judaism|Messiah]].

==History==
{{further|Sea of Galilee Boat}}
Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the town was established in the 2nd century BC during the [[Hasmonean]] period, when a number of new fishing villages sprung up around the lake. The site had no defensive wall and extended along the shore of the nearby lake (from east to west). The cemetery zone is found 200 meters north of the synagogue, which places it beyond the inhabited area of the town. It extended 3 kilometers to [[Tabgha]], an area which appears to have been used for agricultural purposes, judging by the many oil and grain mills which were discovered in the excavation. Fishing was also a source of income; the remains of another harbor were found to the west of that built by the Franciscans.

No sources have been found for the belief that Capernaum was involved in the bloody Jewish revolts against the Romans, the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] (AD 66–73) or [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] (132–135), although there is reason to believe that [[Josephus]], one of the Jewish generals during the earlier revolt, was taken to Capernaum (which he called Κεφαρνωκὸν, &quot;Kapharnakos&quot;) after a fall from his horse in nearby [[Bethsaida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tufts&quot;&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=J.+Vit.+72&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0149 Josephus, ''Vita'' 72, original text in Greek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SacredTexts&quot;&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/autobiog.htm Josephus, ''Vita'', English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephus referred to Capernaum as a fertile spring.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He stayed the night there after bruising his wrist in a riding accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;SacredTexts&quot;/&gt; During the first Jewish revolt of 66–70 Capernaum was spared as it didn't have to be occupied by force by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Image:Capernaum roman olive press by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Olive press from Roman times, different elements]]

In 1838, American explorer [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] discovered the ruins of ancient Capernaum. In 1866, British Captain [[Charles William Wilson]] identified the remains of the synagogue, and in 1894, [[Franciscan]] Friar Giuseppe Baldi of [[Naples]], the [[Custodian of the Holy Land]], was able to recover a good part of the ruins from the [[Bedouins]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The Franciscans raised a [[fence]] to protect the ruins from frequent [[vandalism]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and planted [[Arecaceae|palms]] and [[eucalyptus]] trees brought from Australia to create a small [[oasis]] for [[pilgrim]]s. They also built a small [[harbor]]. These labors were directed by Franciscan [[Virgilio Canio Corbo|Virgilio Corbo]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}{{dubious|BS alert! From Baldi in 1894 to Corbo (1918-1991)) several decades must have passed! This reads as it was all done pre-WWI!|date=November 2015}}

The most important excavations began in 1905 under the direction of [[Germany|Germans]] Heinrich Kohl and [[Carl Watzinger]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} They were continued by Franciscans Fathers Vendelin von Benden (1905–1915) and Gaudenzio&lt;!--CORRECT SPELLING, PLEASE- SEE http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sites/TScpsyIT.html--&gt; Orfali (1921–1926). The excavations resulted in the discovery of two public buildings, the synagogue (which was partially restored by Fr Orfali), and an octagonal church.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Later, in 1968, excavation of the western portion of the site—the portion owned by the Franciscans—was restarted by Corbo and [[Stanislao Loffreda]], with the financial assistance of the [[Italy|Italian government]]. During this phase, the major discovery was of a house which is claimed to be [[St. Peter]]'s house in a neighborhood of the town from the 1st century AD.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} These excavations have been ongoing, with some publication on the Internet as recently as 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sbf/arch/Capharnaum2003.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The excavations revealed that the site was established at the beginning of the Hasmonean period, roughly in the 2nd century BC, and abandoned in the 11th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The eastern half of the site, where the [[Church of the Seven Apostles]] stands and owned by an Orthodox monastery, was surveyed and partially excavated under the direction of [[Vasilios Tzaferis]]. This section has uncovered the village from the Byzantine and Early Arab periods. Features include a pool apparently used for the processing of fish, and a hoard of gold coins. (Tzaferis, 1989).

[[Image:Capernaum ruins by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the Roman-period town.]]

The layout of the town was quite regular. On both sides of an ample north-south main street arose small districts bordered by small cross-sectional streets and no-exit side-streets. The walls were constructed with coarse [[basalt]] blocks and reinforced with stone and mud, but the stones (except for the thresholds) were not dressed and mortar was not used.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The most extensive part of the typical house was the courtyard, where there was a circular furnace made of refractory earth, as well as grain mills and a set of stone stairs that led to the roof. The floors of the houses were cobbled. Around the open courtyard, modest cells were arranged which received light through a series of openings or low windows (Loffreda, 1984).

Given the coarse construction of the walls, there was no second story to a typical home,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and the roof would have been constructed of light wooden beams and thatch mixed with mud. This, along with the discovery of the stairs to the roof, recalls the biblical story of the Healing of the Paralytic: &quot;And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.&quot; ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 2:4) With the type of construction seen in Capernaum, it would not have been difficult to raise the ceiling by the courtyard stairs and to remove a part to allow the bed to be brought down to where Jesus stood.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A study of the district located between the synagogue and the octagonal church showed that several families lived together in the patriarchal style,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} communally using the same courtyards and doorless internal passages. The houses had no hygienic facilities or drainage;{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} the rooms were narrow. Most objects found were made of clay: pots, plates, amphoras, and lamps. Fish hooks, weights for fish nets, striker pins, weaving bobbins, and basalt mills for milling grain and pressing olives were also found (Loffreda, 1974).

As of the 4th century, the houses were constructed with good quality [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and fine ceramics. This was about the time that the synagogue now visible was built.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Differences in social class were not noticeable. Buildings constructed at the founding of the town continued to be in use until the time of the abandonment of the town.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==House of Peter==
[[Image:Capernaum modern church interior by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Interior of the modern Memorial built over the house of St Peter]]
[[Image:Capernaum original church ruins by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Foundations of octagonal 5th-century church, visible through a glass floor]]

One block of homes, called by the Franciscan excavators the ''sacra insula'' or &quot;holy insula&quot; (&quot;insula&quot; refers to a block of homes around a courtyard) was found to have a complex history. Located between the synagogue and the lake shore, it was found near the front of a labyrinth of houses from many different periods. Three principal layers have been identified:
# A group of private houses built around the 1st century BC which remained in use until the early 4th century.
# The great transformation of one of the homes in the 4th century.
# The octagonal church in the middle of the 5th century.

The excavators concluded that one house in the village was venerated as the house of Peter the fisherman as early as the mid-1st century, with two churches having been constructed over it (Loffreda, 1984).

===1st century===
The city's [[basalt]] houses are grouped around two large courtyards, one to the north and the other to the south. One large room in particular, near the east side and joining both courtyards, was especially large (sides about 7.5 meters long) and roughly square. An open space on the eastern side contained a brick oven. A threshold which allowed crossing between the two courtyards remains well-preserved to this day.

Beginning in the latter half of the 1st century AD, this house displayed markedly different characteristics than the other excavated houses. The rough walls were reworked with care and were covered with inscriptions; the floor was covered with a fine layer of plaster. Furthermore, almost no domestic ceramics are recovered, but lamps abound.  One explanation suggested for this treatment is that the room was venerated as a religious gathering place, a ''domus-ecclesia'' or house church, for the Christian community. (Loffreda, 1984) This suggestion has been critiqued by several scholars, however.  In particular, where excavators had claimed to find graffiti including the name of Peter, others have found very little legible writing (Strange and Shanks, 1982).  Others have questioned whether the space is actually a room; the paved floor, the large space without supports, and the presence of a cooking space have prompted some to note that these are more consistent with yet another courtyard (Freyne, 2001).

===4th-century transformation===
In this period, the ''sacra insula'' acquired a new appearance.  First, a thick-walled, slightly trapezoidal enclosure was built surrounding the entire ''insula''; its sides were 27–30 meters long.  Made of plaster, they reached a height of 2.3 meters on the north side.  It had two doors, one in the southwest corner and the other in the northeast corner. Next, although there is evidence that the private houses remained in use after the transformation, the one particular room that had before been treated differently was profoundly altered and expanded. A central archway was added to support a roof and the north wall was strengthened with mortar.  New pavement was installed, and the walls and floor were plastered. (Loffreda, 1974) This structure remained until the middle of the 5th century when the ''sacra insula'' was dismantled and replaced with a larger basilica.

===Octagonal 5th-century church===
The 5th-century church consists of a central octagon with eight pillars, an exterior octagon with thresholds still ''in situ'', and a gallery or portico that leads both into the interior of the church as well as into a complex of associated buildings to the east, a linkage achieved via a short passageway. Later, this passage was blocked and an apse with a pool for baptism was constructed in the middle of the east wall. From this wall ascended two stairs on either side of the baptistery, and the excess water from the rite would have escaped along this path. The [[Byzantine empire|Byzantines]], upon constructing the new church, placed the central octagon directly on top of the walls of St. Peter's house with the aim of preserving its exact location, although none of the original house was visible any longer, as the walls had been torn down and the floor covered in mosaics.

In the portico, the pattern of the mosaic was purely geometric, with four rows of contiguous circles and small crosses. In the zone of the external octagon, the mosaics represented plants and animals in a style similar to that found in the Basilica of the Feeding of the Five Thousand, in Tabgha. In the central octagon, the mosaic was composed of a strip of calcified flowers, of a field of schools of fish with small flowers, and of a great circle with a peacock in the center.

===The Memorial (1990)===
The so-called Memorial is a modern shrine built above the excavated remains of the ancient house and the Byzantine octagonal church, and dedicated in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rex90&quot;&gt;Capharnaum, the Town of Jesus: The ''insula sacra''. ChristusRex.org, (c)2001 [http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/sites/TScpinsu.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The disk-shaped structure stands on concrete stilts, ensuring visibility to the venerated ancient building. Additionally, a glass floor located at the centre of the church allows direct view of the excavated remains below.

==Synagogue==
{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}
[[Image:Capernaum synagogue by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Remains of the 4th-century synagogue]]
The ruins of this building, among the [[oldest synagogues in the world]], were identified by [[Charles William Wilson]].  The large, ornately carved, white building stones of the synagogue stood out prominently among the smaller, plain blocks of local black [[basalt]] used for the town's other buildings, almost all residential.  The synagogue was built almost entirely of white blocks of calcareous stone brought from distant [[quarry|quarries]].

The building consists of four parts: the praying hall, the western [[patio]], a southern [[balustrade]] and a small room at the northwest of the building. The praying hall measured 24.40 m by 18.65 m, with the southern face looking toward [[Jerusalem]].

The internal walls were covered with painted plaster and fine stucco work found during the excavations. Watzinger, like Orfali, believed that there had been an upper floor reserved for women, with access by means of an external staircase located in the small room. But this opinion was not substantiated by the later excavations of the site.

The synagogue appears to have been built around the 4th or 5th century. Beneath the foundation of this synagogue lies another foundation made of basalt, and Loffreda suggests that this is the foundation of a synagogue from the 1st century, perhaps the one mentioned in the Gospels (Loffreda, 1974).  Later excavation work was attempted underneath the synagogue floor, but while Loffreda claimed to have found a paved surface, others are of the opinion that this was an open, paved market area.

The ancient synagogue has two inscriptions, one in [[Greek language|Greek]] and the other in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], that commemorates{{dubious|both? then plural is needed; just the last one only? pls say so|date=April 2016}} the benefactors that helped in the construction of the building. There are also carvings of five- and six-pointed stars and of palm trees.

In 1926, the Franciscan Father {{ill|de|Guadenzio Orfali}} began the restoration of the synagogue. The work was interrupted by his death in a car accident in 1926 (which is commemorated by a Latin inscription carved onto one of the synagogue's columns), and was continued by Virgilio Corbo beginning in 1976.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
