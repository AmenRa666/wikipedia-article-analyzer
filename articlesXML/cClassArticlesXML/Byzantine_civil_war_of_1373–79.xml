The '''Byzantine civil war of 1373–1379''' was a military conflict fought in the [[Byzantine Empire]] between Byzantine Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] and his son, [[Andronikos IV Palaiologos]], also growing into an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] civil war as well, when [[Savcı Bey]], the son of Ottoman Emperor [[Murad I]] joined Andronikos in a joint rebellion against their fathers. It began when Andronikos sought to overthrow his father in 1373. Although he failed, with [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] aid, Andronikos was eventually able to overthrow and imprison John V in 1376. In 1379 however, John V escaped, and with Ottoman help, regained his throne. The civil war further weakened the declining Byzantine Empire, which had already suffered several devastating civil wars earlier in the century. The major beneficiary of the war were the Ottomans, whose vassals the Byzantines had effectively become.

== Background ==
{{details|Byzantium under the Palaiologoi}}
[[File:John V Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]], from a 15th-century manuscript.]]
When [[John V Palaiologos|John V]] assumed sole rule of the Empire in 1354, he pursued a clearly pro-Western foreign policy. He gave [[Lesbos]] and his sister's hand in marriage to a Genoese, [[Heraclea Pontica|Pontic Heraclea]], Byzantium's last [[Anatolia]]n port, was sold to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]],&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold  (1997), p. 788&lt;/ref&gt; and he himself converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], an action that alienated him from his subjects and gained little in return.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning242&quot;&gt;Browning (1992), p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1360s, the Byzantine Empire was a shadow of its former self. Its last domains in [[Thrace]] were being overrun by the Ottomans, who in 1365 captured [[Adrianople]] (modern [[Edirne]]). Seeking aid from the West, in 1369 John V visited [[Pope Urban V]] that summer, and following that he sailed to [[Venice]], where he negotiated a treaty in which the Venetians would cancel the emperor's debt in return for the island of [[Tenedos]]. On leaving Byzantine soil he left his two sons, Andronikos IV and [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel]], to manage [[Constantinople]] and [[Thessalonica]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold  (1997), p. 779&lt;/ref&gt; Andronikos IV, the elder son and co-emperor, however refused to hand over Tenedos to the Venetians as agreed, and the Emperor was detained by the Venetians for two years until Manuel intervened on his behalf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treadgold780&quot;/&gt;

== First conflict – Failed revolt of Andronikos IV, 1373 ==
Andronikos IV resented his father's acceptance of tributary and vassal status to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1373, and in the same year, he joined [[Savcı Bey]], a son of the Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]], in a joint open rebellion against their fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Haldon (2003), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Both revolts were suppressed, although Byzantine military weakness meant that this was largely carried out by Turkish troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treadgold780&quot;/&gt; Murad blinded (and later executed) Savcı and demanded that John V in turn blind both Andronikos and the latter's son, [[John VII Palaiologos|John]], as well. John V did so only partially, leaving Andronikos IV with one eye and his grandson only partially blinded, but he did imprison Andronikos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning242&quot;/&gt; The younger John greatly resented his grandfather's action and would rebel against him in 1390, reigning for five months.&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold (1997), p. 782&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of Andronikos' failure, Manuel was raised to co-emperor and heir to John V as Manuel II.

==Second conflict – Andronikos' usurpation, 1376–1379==
Shortly after Andronikos was imprisoned, John V sold [[Tenedos]] to the Venetians on similar terms to previous failed agreement. The [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] however did not take kindly to the island being in the hands of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], with whom they were embroiled in a [[War of Chioggia|war]]. Thus, in 1376, the Genoese, based in their colony in [[Galata]], helped free Andronikos and procure Ottoman troops for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treadgold780&quot;&gt;Treadgold  (1997), p. 780&lt;/ref&gt; Andronikos assumed control of Constantinople and imprisoned the Emperor John V and his younger brother Manuel. In return for their help, Andronikos IV now gave Tenedos to the Genoese and [[Gallipoli]] to the Ottomans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treadgold780&quot;/&gt;

These acts in turn embroiled him, shortly after his accession, in a war with Venice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treadgold780&quot;/&gt; Together with his son, John VII, who was crowned as co-emperor in 1376, there were now no less than four emperors in Byzantium, all of them more or less pawns in the policies of the Ottomans and the Italian city-states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning242&quot;/&gt; Andronikos IV ruled until 1379, when John V and Manuel II escaped and fled to the court of Murad I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning242&quot;/&gt; After apparently agreeing to cede the virtually independent Byzantine [[exclave]] of [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]] to the Ottomans, John V was reestablished on the throne with the help of Venetian ships and Ottoman soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treadgold781&quot;&gt;Treadgold (1997), p. 781&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
After John V entered the capital, Constantinople, Andronikos IV fled to Genoese Galata and stayed there two years. However he held hostage for a time his mother, [[Helena Kantakouzene]], and her father, the former emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]]. However, in 1381 a treaty was signed in which allowed him to return. Later on the Venetians and Genoese ended their war and agreed to depopulate Tenedos and raze its fortifications, hence transforming it to a neutral territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treadgold781&quot;/&gt; This conflict further weakened the Byzantine Empire, which was surrounded by the massive and ever-expanding Ottoman Empire.
