The '''Gulf War''' (2 August 1990&amp;nbsp;– 28 February 1991), codenamed '''Operation Desert Shield''' (2 August 1990 – 17 January 1991) for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and '''Operation Desert Storm''' (17 January 1991&amp;nbsp;– 28 February 1991) in its combat phase, was a war waged by [[Coalition of the Gulf War|coalition forces]] from 34 nations led by the United States against [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] in response to Iraq's [[Invasion of Kuwait|invasion and annexation of Kuwait]].

The war is also known under other names, such as the '''Persian Gulf War''', '''First Gulf War''', '''Gulf War I''', '''Kuwait War''', '''First Iraq War''', or '''Iraq War'''&lt;ref name=FrontlineCron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/cron/ |title=Frontline Chronology |accessdate=20 March 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=CNN |date=17 January 2001 |title=Tenth anniversary of the Gulf War: A look back |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/01/16/gulf.anniversary/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211060829/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/01/16/gulf.anniversary/index.html |archivedate=11 December 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cfr.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Estes |url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/13865/isn.html |title=ISN: The Second Gulf War (1990–1991) – Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=numbering/&gt; before the term &quot;Iraq War&quot; became identified instead with the [[Iraq War|2003 Iraq War]] (also referred to in the US as &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL34387.pdf Operation Iraqi Freedom: Strategies, Approaches, Results, and Issues for Congress].

The [[Iraqi Army]]'s occupation of [[Kuwait]] that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation, and brought immediate [[Sanctions against Iraq|economic sanctions against Iraq]] by members of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]]. US President [[George H. W. Bush]] deployed [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] into [[Saudi Arabia]], and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the coalition, the largest military alliance since [[World War II]]. The great majority of the coalition's military forces were from the US, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US$32 billion of the US$60 billion cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Peters |first1=John E |last2=Deshong |first2=Howard |title=Out of Area or Out of Reach?

The war was marked by the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the US network [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20110725085143 |url=http://memoriaglobo.globo.com/Memoriaglobo/0,27723,GYN0-5273-256436,00.html |title=Memória Globo }}, access on 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/livrariadafolha/794646-livro-conta-como-guerra-do-golfo-colocou-a-cnn-no-foco-internacional.shtml |title=Livraria da Folha – Livro conta como Guerra do Golfo colocou a CNN no foco internacional – 08/09/2010 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colegioweb.com.br/historia/guerra-do-golfo.html A Guerra do Golfo], accessed on 29 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The war has also earned the nickname ''Video Game War'' after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board US [[bomber]]s during Operation Desert Storm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uel.br/grupo-pesquisa/gepal/segundosimposio/sandrohelenomoraiszarpelao.pdf A Guerra do Golfo, os Estados Unidos e as Relações Internacionais] accessed on 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iraquenewst55.jex.com.br/3+guerra+terrorismo/o+maior+bombardeio+da+historia Guerra/Terrorismo – O maior bombardeio da história], access on 27 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991, continuing for five weeks. This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February. This was a decisive victory for the coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory. The coalition ceased its advance, and declared a ceasefire 100 hours after the ground campaign started. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia's border. Iraq launched [[Scud]] missiles against coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against [[Israel]].

==Terminology==
The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself:
*''Gulf War'' and ''Persian Gulf War'' have been the most common terms for the conflict used within [[Western world|western countries]]. A problem with these terms is that the usage is ambiguous, having now been applied to at least three conflicts: see [[Iraq War (disambiguation)|Gulf War (disambiguation)]]. The use of the term ''Persian Gulf'' (as opposed to ''Arabian Gulf'') is also disputed: see [[Persian Gulf naming dispute]]. With no consensus of naming, various publications have attempted to refine the name. Some variants include:
**''Gulf War'' (e.g. ''The Gulf War'', [[BBC]] television series, 2005; ''Modern Conflicts: The Gulf War'', [[Discovery Channel]] DVD set, 2010)
**''Persian Gulf War'' (e.g. ''Encyclopedia of the Persian Gulf War'', Mark Grossman, 1995; ''An Operational Analysis of the Persian Gulf War'', [[United States Army War College|US Army War College]], 2016)
**''Gulf War (1990–1991)'' (e.g. ''The Gulf War 1991 (Essential Histories)'', Alastair Finlan, 2003; ''Gulf War, 1990-91'', William Thomas Allison, 2012)
**''First Gulf War'' (to distinguish it from the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the subsequent [[Iraq War]]) (e.g. ''Gulf War One: Real Voices from the Front Line, [[Hugh McManners]], 2010)
**''Second Gulf War'' (to distinguish it from the [[Iran–Iraq War]]) (e.g. ''Iraq and the Second Gulf War: State Building and Regime Security'', Mohammad-Mahmoud Mohamedou, 1997)
*''[[Liberation of Kuwait campaign|Liberation of Kuwait]]'' ({{lang-ar|تحرير الكويت}}) (''taḥrīr al-kuwayt'') is the term used by Kuwait and most of the coalition's Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the [[United Arab Emirates]].
*Other language terms include {{lang-fr|la Guerre du Golfe}} and {{lang-de|Golfkrieg}} (''Gulf War''); {{lang-de|Zweiter Golfkrieg}} (''Second Gulf War''); {{lang-fr|Guerre du Koweït}} (''War of Kuwait'')
*''The mother of all battles'' ({{lang-ar|أم المعارك}}) (''umm al-ma‘ārik'') is a term derived from [[Saddam Hussein]] (e.g. ''The Mother of All Battles: Saddam Hussein's Strategic Plan for the Persian Gulf War'', Kevin M. Woods, 2008).

===Operational names===
Most of the coalition states used various names for their operations and the war's operational phases. These are sometimes incorrectly used as the conflict's overall name, especially the US ''Desert Storm'':
*''Operation Desert Shield'' was the US operational name for the US buildup of forces and Saudi Arabia's defense from 2 August 1990, to 16 January 1991.
*''Operation Desert Storm'' was the US name of the [[AirLand Battle|airland conflict]] from 17 January 1991, through 11 April 1991.
**''Operation Desert Sabre'' (early name ''Operation Desert Sword'') was the US name for the airland offensive against the Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (the &quot;100-hour war&quot;) from 24–28 February 1991, in itself, part of ''Operation Desert Storm''.
*''[[Operation Desert Farewell]]'' was the name given to the return of US units and equipment to the US in 1991 after Kuwait's liberation, sometimes referred to as ''Operation Desert Calm''.
*''[[Operation Granby]]'' was the British name for British military activities during the operations and conflict.
*''[[Opération Daguet]]'' was the French name for French military activities in the conflict.
*''[[Operation Friction]]'' was the name of the Canadian operations
*''Operazione Locusta'' (Italian for [[Locust]]) was the Italian name for the operations and conflict.

In addition, various phases of each operation may have a unique operational name.

===Campaign names===
The US divided the conflict into three major campaigns:
*''Defense of Saudi Arabian country'' for the period 2 August 1990, through 16 January 1991.
*''Liberation and Defense of Kuwait'' for the period 17 January 1991, through 11 April 1991.
*''Southwest Asia Cease-Fire'' for the period 12 April 1991, through 30 November 1995, including ''[[Operation Provide Comfort]]''.

==Background==
{{See also|Iraq–United States relations}}
Throughout the [[Cold War]], Iraq had been an ally of the [[Soviet Union]], and there was a history of friction between it and the United States. The US was concerned with Iraq's position on Israeli–[[Palestinians|Palestinian]] politics, and its disapproval of the nature of the peace between Israel and Egypt.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The US also disliked Iraqi support for many [[Arabs|Arab]] and [[Palestinian fedayeen|Palestinian militant]] groups such as [[Abu Nidal]], which led to Iraq's inclusion on the developing US list of [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]] on 29 December 1979. The US remained officially neutral after Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980, which became the Iran–Iraq War, although it provided resources, political support, and some &quot;non-military&quot; aircraft to Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;stork&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Background to the Crisis: Why War? |first1=Joe |last1=Stork|first2=Ann M. |last2=Lesch |journal=Middle East Report |issue=167 |date=November–December 1990 |pages=11–18 |publisher=Middle East Research and Information Project (MERIP)|jstor=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3012998}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1982, Iran began a successful [[counteroffensive]] ([[Operation Undeniable Victory]]), and the US [[United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war|increased its support for Iraq]] to prevent Iran from forcing a surrender. In a US bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Ostensibly, this was because of improvement in the regime's record, although former US Assistant Defense Secretary Noel Koch later stated: &quot;No one had any doubts about [the Iraqis'] continued involvement in [[State terrorism|terrorism]]&amp;nbsp;... The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Borer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume1/july_2003/7_03_2v2.html |title=Inverse Engagement: Lessons from U.S.-Iraq Relations, 1982–1990 |accessdate=12 October 2006 |author=Douglas A. Borer |year=2003 |work=U.S. Army Professional Writing Collection |publisher=US Army}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Iraq's newfound success in the war, and the Iranian rebuff of a peace offer in July, [[International aid to combatants in the Iran–Iraq War|arms sales to Iraq]] reached a record spike in 1982.  When Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] expelled Abu Nidal to Syria at the US' request in November 1983, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] sent [[Donald Rumsfeld]] to meet Saddam as a special envoy and to cultivate ties. By the time the [[Iran-Iraq War#Towards a ceasefire|ceasefire with Iran]] was signed in August 1988, Iraq was heavily debt-ridden and tensions within society were rising.&lt;ref&gt;Simons (2003). p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of its debt was owed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Iraq pressured both nations to forgive the debts, but they refused.&lt;ref&gt;Simons (2003). pp. 341–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ku-map.gif|thumb|left|Map of Kuwait]]

The Iraq–Kuwait dispute also involved Iraqi claims to Kuwait as Iraqi territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;stork&quot; /&gt; Kuwait had been a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Basra Vilayet|province of Basra]], something that Iraq claimed made it rightful Iraq territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;simons343344&quot;&gt;Simons (2003). pp. 343–344.&lt;/ref&gt; Its ruling dynasty, the [[House of Sabah|al-Sabah family]], had concluded a [[protectorate]] agreement in 1899 that assigned responsibility for its foreign affairs to the United Kingdom. The UK drew the border between the two countries in 1922, making Iraq virtually landlocked.&lt;ref name=&quot;stork&quot; /&gt; Kuwait rejected Iraqi attempts to secure further provisions in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;simons343344&quot; /&gt;

Iraq also accused Kuwait of exceeding its [[OPEC]] quotas for oil production. In order for the cartel to maintain its desired price of $18 a barrel, discipline was required. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were consistently overproducing; the latter at least in part to repair losses caused by Iranian attacks in the Iran–Iraq War and to pay for the losses of an economic scandal. The result was a slump in the oil price – as low as $10 a barrel – with a resulting loss of $7 billion a year to Iraq, equal to its 1989 [[balance of payments]] deficit.&lt;ref&gt;Simons (2003). pp. 339–340.&lt;/ref&gt; Resulting revenues struggled to support the government's basic costs, let alone repair Iraq's damaged infrastructure. [[Jordan]] and Iraq both looked for more discipline, with little success.&lt;ref name=&quot;simons341&quot;&gt;Simons (2003). p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi government described it as a form of economic warfare,&lt;ref name=&quot;simons341&quot; /&gt; which it claimed was aggravated by Kuwait [[Directional drilling|slant-drilling]] across the border into Iraq's [[Rumaila oil field]].&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, William L. ''A History of the Modern Middle East. 2nd Ed'' pg. 464&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Saddam looked for closer ties with those Arab states that had supported Iraq in the war. This was supported by the US, who believed that Iraqi ties with pro-Western Gulf states would help bring and maintain Iraq inside the US' sphere of influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simons334&quot;&gt;Simons (2003). p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, it appeared that [[Iraq–Saudi Arabia relations|Saudi–Iraqi relations]], strong during the war, would be maintained. A pact of non-interference and non-aggression was signed between the countries, followed by a Kuwaiti-Iraqi deal for Iraq to supply Kuwait with water for drinking and irrigation, although a request for Kuwait to lease Iraq [[Umm Qasr]] was rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simons334&quot; /&gt; Saudi-backed development projects were hampered by Iraq's large debts, even with the [[demobilization]] of 200,000 soldiers. Iraq also looked to increase arms production so as to become an exporter, although the success of these projects was also restrained by Iraq's obligations; in Iraq, resentment to OPEC's controls mounted.&lt;ref&gt;Simons (2003). p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saddam rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|[[Donald Rumsfeld]] as US special envoy to the Middle East, meets [[Saddam Hussein]] on 19–20 December 1983.]]
Iraq's relations with its Arab neighbors – in particular Egypt – were degraded by mounting violence in Iraq against expatriate groups, well-employed during the war, by Iraqi unemployed, among them demobilized soldiers. These events drew little notice outside the Arab world because of fast-moving events in Eastern Europe. However, the US did begin to condemn Iraq's human rights record, including the well-known use of torture.&lt;ref&gt;Simons (2003). p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK also condemned the execution of [[Farzad Bazoft]], a journalist working for the British newspaper ''[[Observer (newspaper)|The Observer]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;stork&quot; /&gt; Following Saddam's declaration that &quot;binary chemical weapons&quot; would be used on Israel if it used military force against Iraq, Washington halted part of its funding.&lt;ref&gt;Simons (2003). pp. 337–338.&lt;/ref&gt; A UN mission to the [[Israeli-occupied territories]], where riots had resulted in Palestinian deaths, was [[veto]]ed by the US, making Iraq deeply skeptical of US foreign policy aims in the region, combined with the US' reliance on Middle Eastern energy reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Simons (2003). p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early July 1990, Iraq complained about Kuwait's behavior, such as not respecting their quota, and openly threatened to take military action. On the 23rd, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] reported that Iraq had moved 30,000 troops to the Iraq-Kuwait border, and the US naval fleet in the Persian Gulf was placed on alert. Saddam believed an anti-Iraq conspiracy was developing – Kuwait had begun talks with Iran, and Iraq's rival Syria had arranged a visit to Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;simons343&quot;&gt;Simons (2003). p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon review by the Secretary of Defense, it was found that Syria indeed planned a strike against Iraq in the coming days.  Saddam immediately used funding to incorporate central intelligence into Syria and ultimately prevented the impending air strike. On 15 July 1990, Saddam's government laid out its combined objections to the [[Arab League]], including that policy moves were costing Iraq $1 billion a year, that Kuwait was still using the Rumaila oil field, that loans made by the UAE and Kuwait could not be considered debts to its &quot;Arab brothers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;simons343&quot;/&gt; He threatened force against Kuwait and the UAE, saying: &quot;The policies of some Arab rulers are American&amp;nbsp;... They are inspired by America to undermine Arab interests and security.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yousseff M. Ibrahim, [http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/18/business/iraq-threatens-emirates-and-kuwait-on-oil-glut.html? &quot;Iraq Threatens Emirates And Kuwait on Oil Glut&quot;] ''New York Times'', 18 July 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The US sent aerial refuelling planes and combat ships to the Persian Gulf in response to these threats.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R.

On the 25th, Saddam met with [[April Glaspie]], the [[United States Ambassador to Iraq|US Ambassador to Iraq]], in Baghdad. The Iraqi leader attacked American policy with regards to Kuwait and the UAE:
{{quote|So what can it mean when America says it will now protect its friends? It can only mean prejudice against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights&amp;nbsp;... If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force. We know that you can harm us although we do not threaten you. But we too can harm you. Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot come all the way to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you&amp;nbsp;... We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to be friends. But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/23/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-excerpts-from-iraqi-document-on-meeting-with-us-envoy.html? &quot;CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; Excerpts From Iraqi Document on Meeting With U.S. Envoy&quot;] ''New York Times'', 23 September 1990&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Glaspie replied:
{{quote|I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait&amp;nbsp;... Frankly, we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south. Normally that would not be any of our business. But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the UAE and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt;}}

Saddam stated that he would attempt last-ditch negotiations with the Kuwaitis but Iraq &quot;would not accept death&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt;

According to Glaspie's own account, she stated in reference to the precise border between Kuwait and Iraq, &quot;...&amp;nbsp; that she had served in Kuwait 20 years before; 'then, as now, we took no position on these Arab affairs'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;90BAGHDAD4237&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/1990/07/90BAGHDAD4237.html| title=Saddam's message of friendship to president Bush (Wikileaks telegram 90BAGHDAD4237)| accessdate=2 January 2011| publisher=US Department of State| date=25 July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glaspie similarly believed that war was not imminent.&lt;ref name=&quot;finlan2526&quot;/&gt;

==Invasion of Kuwait==
{{Main article|Invasion of Kuwait}}

The result of the Jeddah talks was an Iraqi demand for $10 billion to cover the lost revenues from Rumaila; the Kuwaiti response was to offer $9 billion. The Iraqi response was to immediately order the invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;finlan26&quot;&gt;Finlan (2003). p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 1990, Iraq launched the invasion by bombing Kuwait's capital, [[Kuwait City]].

At the time of the invasion, the [[Military of Kuwait|Kuwaiti military]] was believed to have numbered 16,000 men, arranged into three armored, one mechanised infantry and one under-strength artillery brigade.&lt;ref name=&quot;loccs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kw0058) |title=Kuwait: Organization and Mission of the Forces |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-war strength of the [[Kuwait Air Force]] was around 2,200 Kuwaiti personnel, with 80 aircraft and forty helicopters.&lt;ref name=&quot;loccs&quot;/&gt;  In spite of Iraqi [[saber-rattling]], Kuwait didn't have its forces on alert; the army had been stood down on 19 July.&lt;ref&gt;Finlan (2003). p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, at the Iran–Iraq War's end, the Iraqi Army was the world's fourth largest army; it consisted of 955,000 standing soldiers and 650,000 paramilitary forces in the Popular Army. According to John Childs and André Corvisier, a low estimate shows the Iraqi Army capable of fielding 4,500 tanks, 484 combat aircraft and 232 combat helicopters.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilSize&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Childs, John |author2=Corvisier, André |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nEQ7FUAdmc8C&amp;pg=PA403 403] |title=A Dictionary of Military History and the Art of War |location=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-631-16848-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael Knights, a high estimate shows the Iraqi Army capable of fielding one million men and 850,000 reservists, 5,500 tanks, 3,000 artillery pieces, 700 combat aircraft and helicopters; and held 53 divisions, 20 special-forces brigades, and several regional militias, and had a strong air defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Knights, Michael | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FDJmjUUR9CUC&amp;pg=PA20 20] |title=Cradle of Conflict: Iraq and the Birth of Modern U.S. Military Power |location=[[United States Naval Institute]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-59114-444-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraqi commandos infiltrated the Kuwaiti border first to prepare for the major units which began the attack at midnight.  The Iraqi attack had two prongs, with the primary attack force driving south straight for Kuwait City down the main highway, and a supporting attack force entering Kuwait farther west, but then turning and driving east, cutting off Kuwait City from the country's southern half. The commander of a Kuwaiti armored battalion, 35th Armoured [[Brigade]], deployed them against the Iraqi attack and was able to conduct a robust defense ([[Battle of the Bridges]]), near [[Al Jahra]], west of Kuwait City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Vaught |url=http://users.lighthouse.net/danvaught/eyewitness01.html |title=Eyewitness, Col.

Kuwaiti aircraft [[scrambling (military)|scrambled]] to meet the invading force, but approximately 20% were lost or captured. A few combat sorties were flown against Iraqi ground forces.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper |first=Tom |last2=Sadik |first2=Ahmad |title=Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait; 1990 |date=16 September 2003 |journal=Air Combat Information Group |url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_213.shtml |accessdate=17 April 2010|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main Iraqi thrust into Kuwait City was conducted by [[commando]]s deployed by helicopters and boats to attack the city from the sea, while other divisions seized the airports and two [[airbase]]s. The Iraqis [[Battle of Dasman Palace|attacked the Dasman Palace]], the Royal Residence of [[List of emirs of Kuwait|Kuwait's Emir]], [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]], which was defended by the Emiri Guard supported with [[M-84]] tanks. In the process, the Iraqis killed [[Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]], the Emir's youngest brother.

Within 12 hours, most resistance had ended within Kuwait and the royal family had fled, leaving Iraq in control of most of Kuwait.&lt;ref name=&quot;finlan26&quot;/&gt; After two days of intense combat, most of the [[Military of Kuwait|Kuwaiti military]] were either overrun by the [[Iraqi Republican Guard]], or had escaped to Saudi Arabia. The Emir and key ministers were able to get out and head south along the highway for refuge in Saudi Arabia. Iraqi ground forces consolidated their control of Kuwait City, then headed south and redeployed along the Saudi border. After the decisive Iraqi victory, Saddam initially installed a puppet regime known as the &quot;[[Republic of Kuwait|Provisional Government of Free Kuwait]]&quot; before installing his cousin [[Ali Hassan al-Majid]] as Kuwait's governor on 8 August.

==Run-up to the war==

===Diplomatic means===
A key element of US political-military and energy economic planning occurred in early 1984. The Iran–Iraq war had been going on for five years and there were significant casualties on both sides, reaching hundreds of thousands. Within President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]] concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents. A National Security Planning Group meeting was formed, chaired by then Vice President George H. W. Bush to review US options. It was determined that there was a high likelihood that the conflict would spread into Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region. Furthermore, it was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile recovery of the world economy which was just beginning to gain momentum. On 22 May 1984, President Reagan was briefed on the project conclusions in the Oval Office by [[William Flynn Martin]] who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study. The full declassified presentation can be seen here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/Reagan%20Administration/WFM%20Papers%20from%20Reagan%20Archives/Iran-Iraq/Presentation%20on%20Gulf%20Oil%20Disruption%205-22-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusions were threefold: first oil stocks needed to be increased among members of the [[International Energy Agency]] and, if necessary, released early in the event of oil market disruption; second the United States needed to beef up the security of friendly Arab states in the region and thirdly an embargo should be placed on sales of military equipment to Iran and Iraq. The Plan was approved by the President Reagan and later affirmed by the G-7 leaders headed by Great Britain's Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[10th G7 summit|London Summit of 1984]]. The plan was implemented and became the basis for US preparedness to respond to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991.

Within hours of the invasion, Kuwait and US delegations requested a meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], which passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 660|Resolution 660]], condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal of Iraqi troops.&lt;ref&gt;Finlan (2003). p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Security Council: 16 June 1990 - 15 June 1991|date=1993|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|issn=0082-8238|page=30|type=digital document}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 August, the [[Arab League]] passed its own resolution, which called for a solution to the conflict from within the League, and warned against outside intervention; Iraq and Libya were the only two Arab League states which opposed a resolution for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. The PLO opposed it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths/mf12.html |title=Myths &amp; Facts – The Gulf Wars |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab states of Yemen and Jordan – a Western ally which bordered Iraq and relied on the country for economic support&lt;ref name=&quot;lkjomzvc&quot; /&gt; – opposed military intervention from non-Arab states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=David A |last=Deese |url=http://www.laughtergenealogy.com/bin/histprof/misc/desertstorm.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050114141303/http://www.laughtergenealogy.com/bin/histprof/misc/desertstorm.html |archivedate=2005-01-14 |title=Persian Gulf War, Desert Storm – War with Iraqi |publisher=Concord Learning Systems |work=The History Professor |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arab state of Sudan aligned itself with Saddam.&lt;ref name=&quot;lkjomzvc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue2/jv6n2a7.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020804061624/http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue2/jv6n2a7.html |archivedate=2002-08-04 |title=The 1991 Gulf War And Jordan's Economy |author1=Ziad Swaidan |author2=Mihai Nica |journal=Middle East Review of International Affairs |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=June 2002 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, he called for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, and &quot;mutual withdrawals by Iraq and Iran and arrangement for the situation in Kuwait.&quot; He also called for a replacement of US troops that mobilized in Saudi Arabia in response to Kuwait's invasion with &quot;an Arab force&quot;, as long as that force did not involve Egypt. Additionally, he requested an &quot;immediate freeze of all boycott and siege decisions&quot; and a general normalization of relations with Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Confrontation in the Gulf; Proposals by Iraqi President: Excerpts From His Address |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |pages=A8 |date=13 August 1990 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/13/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-proposals-by-iraqi-president-excerpts-from-his-address.html |accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the crisis, President Bush was strongly opposed to any &quot;linkage&quot; between Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and the Palestinian issue.&lt;ref name=sam /&gt;

On 23 August, Saddam appeared on state television with Western hostages to whom he had refused exit visas.

Another Iraqi proposal communicated in August 1990 was delivered to US National Security Advisor [[Brent Scowcroft]] by an unidentified Iraqi official. The official communicated to the White House that Iraq would &quot;withdraw from Kuwait and allow foreigners to leave&quot; provided that the UN lifted sanctions, allowed &quot;guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf through the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warbah&quot;, and allowed Iraq to &quot;gain full control of the Rumaila oil field that extends slightly into Kuwaiti territory&quot;. The proposal also &quot;include[d] offers to negotiate an oil agreement with the United States 'satisfactory to both nations' national security interests,' develop a joint plan 'to alleviate Iraq's economical and financial problems' and 'jointly work on the stability of the gulf.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Secret Offer&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Royce |first=Knut |title=MIDDLE EAST CRISIS Secret Offer Iraq Sent Pullout Deal to U.S |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |location=New York |date=29 August 1990 |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/38969813/MIDDLE-EAST-CRISIS-Secret-Offer-Iraq-Sent-Pullout-Deal-to-U-S-ALL-EDITIONS |accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1990, Iraq made a proposal to withdraw from Kuwait provided that foreign troops left the region and that an agreement was reached regarding the Palestinian problem and the dismantlement of both Israel's and Iraq's [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The [[White House]] rejected the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Royce |first=Knut |title=Iraq Offers Deal to Quit Kuwait U.S. rejects it, but stays 'interested' |newspaper=[[Newsday]] Washington Bureau |date=3 January 1991|location=Long Island, N.Y |page=5 |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/38969954/Iraq-Offers-Deal-to-Quit-Kuwait-U-S-rejects-it-but-stays-interested-NASSAU-AND-SUFFOLK-Edition |accessdate=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]'s [[Yasser Arafat]] expressed that neither he nor Saddam insisted that solving the Israel–Palestine issues should be a precondition to solving the issues in Kuwait, though he did acknowledge a &quot;strong link&quot; between these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tyler |first=Patrick E. |title=CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; Arafat Eases Stand on Kuwait-Palestine Link |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |date=3 January 1991 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/03/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-arafat-eases-stand-on-kuwait-palestine-link.html |accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the US stuck to its position that there would be no negotiations until Iraq withdrew from Kuwait and that they should not grant Iraq concessions, lest they give the impression that Iraq benefited from its military campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;hard line&quot; /&gt; Also, when US Secretary of State [[James Baker]] met with [[Tariq Aziz]] in Geneva, Switzerland, for last minute peace talks in early 1991, Aziz reportedly made no concrete proposals and did not outline any hypothetical Iraqi moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Thomas L.|title=CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; As U.S. Officials See It, Hands of Aziz Were Tied|newspaper=The New York Times|pages=A10|date=11 January 1991|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/11/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-as-us-officials-see-it-hands-of-aziz-were-tied.html?scp=151&amp;sq=Iraq&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 1990, the Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|Resolution 678]] which gave Iraq until 15 January 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait and empowered states to use &quot;all necessary means&quot; to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline.

On 14 January 1991, France proposed that the UN Security Council call for &quot;a rapid and massive withdrawal&quot; from Kuwait along with a statement to Iraq that Council members would bring their &quot;active contribution&quot; to a settlement of the region's other problems, &quot;in particular, of the Arab–Israeli conflict and in particular to the Palestinian problem by convening, at an appropriate moment, an international conference&quot; to assure &quot;the security, stability and development of this region of the world.&quot; The French proposal was supported by Belgium (at the moment one of the rotating Council members), Germany, Spain, Italy, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and several non-aligned nations. The US, the UK, and the Soviet Union rejected it; US Ambassador to the UN [[Thomas R. Pickering|Thomas Pickering]] stated that the French proposal was unacceptable, because it went beyond previous Council resolutions on the Iraqi invasion.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Lewis, &quot;Confrontation in the Gulf: The U.N.; France and 3 Arab States Issue an Appeal to Hussein,&quot; ''New York Times'', 15 January 1991, p.

[[File:Multiple F-15E parked during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|thumb|F-15Es parked during Operation Desert Shield.]]
One of the West's main concerns was the significant threat Iraq posed to Saudi Arabia. Following Kuwait's conquest, the Iraqi Army was within easy striking distance of Saudi [[oil field]]s. Control of these fields, along with Kuwaiti and Iraqi reserves, would have given Saddam control over the majority of the world's oil reserves. Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis had lent Iraq some 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran. The Saudis had backed Iraq in that war, as they feared the influence of [[Shia]] Iran's [[Islamic revolution]] on its own Shia minority. After the war, Saddam felt he shouldn't have to repay the loans due to the help he had given the Saudis by fighting Iran.

Soon after his conquest of Kuwait, Saddam began verbally attacking the Saudis. He argued that the US-supported Saudi state was an illegitimate and unworthy guardian of the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. He combined the language of the [[Islamist]] groups that had recently fought in Afghanistan with the rhetoric Iran had long used to attack the Saudis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Kepel]] ''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Acting on the [[Carter Doctrine]]'s policy, and out of fear the Iraqi Army could launch an invasion of Saudi Arabia, US President George H. W. Bush quickly announced that the US would launch a &quot;wholly defensive&quot; mission to prevent Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia under the codename Operation Desert Shield. Operation Desert Shield began on 7 August 1990 when US troops were sent to Saudi Arabia due also to the request of its monarch, [[King Fahd]], who had earlier called for US military assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFPS Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm Timeline |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2000/n08082000_20008088.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526135240/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45404 |archivedate=26 May 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;wholly defensive&quot; doctrine was quickly abandoned when, on 8 August, Iraq declared Kuwait to be Iraq's 19th province and Saddam named his cousin, Ali Hassan Al-Majid, as its military-governor.&lt;ref name=AFPS15years&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Years After Desert Storm, U.S. Commitment to Region Continues |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=14792 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608084842/http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=14792|archivedate=2011-06-08|accessdate=29 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|US Navy]] dispatched two naval battle groups built around the [[aircraft carriers]] [[USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69)|USS ''Dwight D. Eisenhower'']] and [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS ''Independence'']] to the Persian Gulf, where they were ready by 8 August. The US also sent the battleships [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']] to the region. A total of 48 US Air Force F-15s from the [[1st Fighter Wing]] at [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia, landed in Saudi Arabia, and immediately commenced round the clock air patrols of the Saudi–Kuwait–Iraq border to discourage further Iraqi military advances. They were joined by 36 F-15 A-Ds from the [[36th Wing|36th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at Bitburg, Germany.  The Bitburg contingent was based at [[Al Kharj Air Base]], approximately 1-hour southeast of Riyadh.  The 36th TFW would be responsible for 11 confirmed Iraqi Air Force aircraft shot down during the war. There were also two Air National Guard units stationed at Al Kharj Air Base, the South Carolina Air National Guard's 169th Fighter Wing flew bombing missions with 24 F-16s flying 2,000 combat missions and dropping 4 million pounds of munitions, and the New York Air National Guard's 174th Fighter Wing from Syracuse flew 24 F-16s on bombing missions. Military buildup continued from there, eventually reaching 543,000 troops, twice the number used in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Much of the material was airlifted or carried to the staging areas via [[Fast Sealift Ship|fast sealift ships]], allowing a quick buildup.

====Creating a coalition====
[[File:Coalition of the Gulf War vs Iraq.png|thumb|425px|Nations that deployed coalition forces or provided support.]]
A [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq|series of UN Security Council resolutions]] and Arab League resolutions were passed regarding Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. One of the most important was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|Resolution 678]], passed on 29 November 1990, which gave Iraq a withdrawal deadline until 15 January 1991, and authorized &quot;all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660&quot;, and a diplomatic formulation authorizing the use of force if Iraq failed to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/11205/un_security_council_resolution_678_iraq_kuwait.html?breadcrumb=%2Fregion%2F408%2Fkuwait |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |title=Essential Documents: UN Security Council Resolution 678 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure that economic backing, Baker went on an eleven-day journey to nine countries that the press dubbed &quot;The Tin Cup Trip&quot;.  The first stop was Saudi Arabia, who a month before had already granted permission to the United States to use its facilities.  However, Baker believed that Saudi Arabia, an immensely wealthy nation, should assume some of the cost of the military efforts, since one of the most decisive military objectives was defending Saudi Arabia.  When Baker asked King Fahd for 15 billion dollars, the King readily agreed, with the promise that Baker ask Kuwait for the same amount.

The next day, 7 September, he did just that, and the Emir of Kuwait, displaced in a Sheraton hotel outside his invaded country, easily agreed. Baker then moved to enter talks with Egypt, whose leadership he considered to be &quot;the moderate voice of the middle east&quot;.  President Mubarak of Egypt was furious with Saddam for his invasion of Kuwait, and for the fact that Saddam had assured Mubarak that an invasion was not his intention.  Therefore, he was willing to commit troops to the coalition forces to quell Saddam, as well as relieved the United States was willing to forgive his country's 7.1 billion dollar debt.

After stops in Helsinki and Moscow to smooth out Iraqi demands for a middle-eastern peace conference with Russia (then the Soviet Union), Baker traveled to Syria to discuss its role in the crisis with its President [[Hafez al-Assad|Hafez Assad]]. Assad had a deep personal enmity towards Saddam, which was defined by the fact that &quot;Saddam had been trying to kill him [Assad] for years&quot;. Harboring this animosity and being impressed with Baker's diplomatic initiative to visit Damascus (relations had been severed since the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings|1983 bombing of US Marine barracks]] in [[Beirut]]), Assad agreed to pledge up to 100,000 Syrian troops to the coalition effort. This was a vital step in ensuring Arab states were represented in the coalition.

Baker flew to Rome for a brief visit with the Italians in which he was promised the use of some military equipment, before journeying to Germany to meet with American ally Chancellor Kohl.  Although Germany's constitution (which was brokered essentially by the United States) prohibited military involvement in outside nations, Kohl was willing to repay his gratitude for the United States with a two billion dollar contribution to the coalition's war effort, as well as further economic and military support of coalition ally Turkey, and the execution of the transport of Egyptian soldiers and ships to the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, James Addison, and Thomas M. DeFrank. ''The Politics of Diplomacy: Revolution, War, and Peace, 1989–1992''. New York: Putnam, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bush saudi arabia.jpg|thumb|General [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.]] and President [[George H. W. Bush]] visit US troops in Saudi Arabia on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], 1990.]]
A coalition of forces opposing Iraq's aggression was formed, consisting of forces from 34 countries: Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Italy, Kuwait, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Spain, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the US itself. It was the largest coalition since [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/gulf.war/facts/gulfwar/|title=The Unfinished War: A Decade Since Desert Storm|publisher=CNN In-Depth Specials|year=2001|accessdate=5 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317110507/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/gulf.war/facts/gulfwar/ |archivedate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Army General [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.]] was designated to be the commander of the coalition forces in the Persian Gulf area. The [[Soviet Union]] also supported United States intervention.

Although they did not contribute any forces, Japan and Germany made financial contributions totaling $10 billion and $6.6 billion respectively. US troops represented 73% of the coalition's 956,600 troops in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Lawrence, and Efraim Karsh. ''The Gulf Conflict 1990–1991: Diplomacy and War in the New World Order''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the coalition countries were reluctant to commit military forces. Some felt that the war was an internal Arab affair or did not want to increase US influence in the Middle East. In the end, however, many nations were persuaded by Iraq's belligerence towards other Arab states, offers of economic aid or debt forgiveness, and threats to withhold aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/31/AR2006103101217.html |title=Security Council Seat Tied to Aid |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=18 March 2010 |first=Colum |last=Lynch |date=1 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Justification for intervention====
[[File:Cheney meeting with Prince Sultan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dick Cheney]] meets with [[Sultan, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Prince Sultan, Minister of Defence and Aviation]] in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to handle the [[invasion of Kuwait]]]]
The US and the UN gave several public justifications for involvement in the conflict, the most prominent being the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity. In addition, the US moved to support its ally Saudi Arabia, whose importance in the region, and as a key supplier of oil, made it of considerable [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] importance. Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, US Defense Secretary [[Dick Cheney]] made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where [[King Fahd]] requested US military assistance. During a speech in a special joint session of the US Congress given on 11 September 1990, US President George H. W. Bush summed up the reasons with the following remarks: &quot;Within three days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia. It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3425|first=George H. W.|last=Bush |title=Address Before a Joint Session of Congress|publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs|date=11 September 1990 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pentagon stated that satellite photos showing a buildup of Iraqi forces along the border were this information's source, but this was later alleged to be false. A reporter for the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' acquired two commercial Soviet satellite images made at the time in question, which showed nothing but empty desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/tampabay/access/50586247.html?dids=50586247:50586247&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+6%252C+1991&amp;author=JEAN+HELLER&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1.A&amp;desc=Photos+don%2527t+show+buildup |title= Photos don't show buildup |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=6 January 1991 |accessdate=13 January 2012 |first=Jean |last=Heller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other justifications for foreign involvement included Iraq's history of human rights [[Human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq|abuses under Saddam]]. Iraq was also known to possess [[biological warfare|biological weapons]] and [[chemical warfare|chemical weapons]], which Saddam had used against Iranian troops during the Iran–Iraq War and against his own country's [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population in the [[Al-Anfal campaign]]. Iraq was also known to have a [[nuclear weapon]]s program, but the report about it from January 1991 was partially declassified by the CIA on 26 May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]], Volume 59, page 33, Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science (Chicago, Ill.), Atomic Scientists of Chicago, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (Organization), 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were human rights abuses committed in Kuwait by the invading Iraqi military, the alleged incidents which received most publicity in the US were inventions of the [[public relations]] firm hired by the government of Kuwait to influence US opinion in favor of military intervention. Shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the organization ''[[Citizens for a Free Kuwait]]'' was formed in the US. It hired the public relations firm [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] for about $11 million, paid by [[Government of Kuwait|Kuwait's government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prwatch.org/books/tsigfy10.html |title=How PR Sold the War in the Persian Gulf &amp;#124; Center for Media and Democracy |publisher=Prwatch.org |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many other means of influencing US opinion (distributing books on Iraqi atrocities to US soldiers deployed in the region, &quot;Free Kuwait&quot; T-shirts and speakers to college campuses, and dozens of video news releases to television stations), the firm arranged for an appearance before a group of members of the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] in which a woman identifying herself as a [[Nayirah (testimony)|nurse working in the Kuwait City hospital]] described Iraqi soldiers pulling babies out of incubators and letting them die on the floor.&lt;ref name=kuwaitgate /&gt;

The story was an influence in tipping both the public and Congress towards a war with Iraq: six Congressmen said the testimony was enough for them to support military action against Iraq and seven Senators referenced the testimony in debate. The Senate supported the military actions in a 52–47 vote. However, a year after the war, this allegation was revealed to be a fabrication. The woman who had testified was found to be a member of [[House of Sabah|Kuwait's Royal Family]], in fact the daughter of Kuwait's ambassador to the US.&lt;ref name=kuwaitgate&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n9_v24/ai_12529902 | work=Washington Monthly | title=Kuwaitgate – killing of Kuwaiti babies by Iraqi soldiers exaggerated | first=Ted | last=Rowse | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hadn't lived in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion.

The details of the Hill &amp; Knowlton public relations campaign, including the incubator testimony, were published in [[John R. MacArthur]]'s ''Second Front: Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War'' (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1992), and came to wide public attention when an [[Op-ed]] by MacArthur was published in ''[[The New York Times]]''. This prompted a reexamination by [[Amnesty International]], which had originally promoted an account alleging even greater numbers of babies torn from incubators than the original fake testimony. After finding no evidence to support it, the organization issued a retraction. President Bush then repeated the incubator allegations on television.

At the same time, the Iraqi Army committed several well-documented crimes during its occupation of Kuwait, such as the [[summary execution|summary execution without trial]] of three brothers after which their bodies were stacked in a pile and left to decay in a public street.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya 1993, p 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi troops also ransacked and looted private Kuwaiti homes; one residence was repeatedly defecated in.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya 1993, pp 31–33&lt;/ref&gt; A resident later commented: &quot;The whole thing was violence for the sake of violence, destruction for the sake of destruction&amp;nbsp;... Imagine a [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] painting by [[Salvador Dalí]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Makiya 1993, p 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Gulf War air campaign}}
[[File:F-117 Nighthawk Front.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[USAF]] [[F-117 Nighthawk]], one of the key players in Desert Storm.]]

The Gulf War began with an extensive [[aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombing]] campaign on 16 January 1991. For forty-two consecutive days and nights, the coalition forces subjected Iraq to the most intensive air bombardment in military history. The coalition flew over 100,000 [[sortie]]s, dropping 88,500 tons of bombs,&lt;ref&gt;name=cnnstats {{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/caah/history/FacultyPages/EdMoise/limit1.html |author=Edwin E. Moïse |title=Limited War : The Stereotypes |publisher=Clemson University |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and widely destroying military and civilian infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/desert_storm.htm Operation Desert Storm] globalsecurity.com&lt;/ref&gt; The air campaign was commanded by [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Lieutenant General]] [[Chuck Horner]], who briefly served as [[United States Central Command|US Central Command]]'s Commander-in-Chief – Forward while General Schwarzkopf was still in the US.

A day after the deadline set in Resolution 678, the coalition launched a massive air campaign, which began the general offensive codenamed Operation Desert Storm. The first priority was the destruction of Iraq's Air Force and anti-aircraft facilities. The sorties were launched mostly from Saudi Arabia and the six [[carrier battle group]]s (CVBG) in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Red Sea]].

[[File:Destroyed Iraqi T-54A or Type 59.JPEG|thumb|An Iraqi T-54A or Type 59 tank lies destroyed after a coalition bombing attack during Operation Desert Storm.]]

The next targets were command and communication facilities. Saddam Hussein had closely [[micromanagement|micromanaged]] Iraqi forces in the Iran–Iraq War, and initiative at lower levels was discouraged. Coalition planners hoped that Iraqi resistance would quickly collapse if deprived of command and control.

The air campaign's third and largest phase targeted military targets throughout Iraq and Kuwait: [[Scud]] missile launchers, weapons research facilities, and naval forces. About one-third of the coalition's air power was devoted to attacking Scuds, some of which were on trucks and therefore difficult to locate. US and British [[special forces|special operations forces]] had been covertly inserted into western Iraq to aid in the search for and destruction of Scuds.

Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses, including [[man-portable air-defense systems]], were surprisingly ineffective against enemy aircraft and the coalition suffered only 75 aircraft losses in over 100,000 sorties, 44 due to Iraqi action.

===Iraqi missile strikes on Israel and Saudi Arabia===
[[File:scud TEL launch.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Scud]] Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) with missile in upright position.]]
Iraq's government made no secret that it would attack if invaded. Prior to the war's start, in the aftermath of the failed US–Iraq peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, a reporter asked Iraq's English-speaking Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz: &quot;Mr. Foreign Minister, if war starts&amp;nbsp;... will you attack?&quot; His response was: &quot;Yes, absolutely, yes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh, ''The Gulf Conflict: Diplomacy and War in the New World Order'', 1990–1991 (Princeton, 1993), 332.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Post Video To Facebook |url=http://www.c-spanarchives.org/program/ID/176306&amp;start=607&amp;end=657 |title=Geneva Meeting on Persian Gulf Crisis |publisher=C-SPAN |date=9 January 1991 |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five hours after the first attacks, Iraq's state radio broadcast declaring that &quot;The dawn of victory nears as this great showdown begins.&quot; Iraq fired eight missiles the next day. These missile attacks were to continue throughout the war. A total of 88 Scud missiles were fired by Iraq during the war's seven weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqwatch.org/government/US/Pentagon/dodscud.htm|title=Information Paper: Iraq's Scud Ballistic Missiles|first=Bernard|last=Rostker|year=2000|publisher=Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control from 2000 to 2006|accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq hoped to provoke a military response from Israel. The Iraqi government hoped that many Arab states would withdraw from the Coalition, as they would be reluctant to fight alongside Israel.&lt;ref name=sam&gt;Waldman, Shmuel (2005). ''Beyond a Reasonable Doubt''. Feldheim Publishers, p. 179. ISBN 1-58330-806-7&lt;/ref&gt; Following the first attacks, [[Israeli Air Force]] jets were deployed to patrol the northern airspace with Iraq. Israel prepared to militarily retaliate, as its policy for the previous forty years had always been retaliation. However, President Bush pressured Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] not to retaliate and withdraw Israeli jets, fearing that if Israel attacked Iraq, the other Arab nations would either desert the coalition or join Iraq. It was also feared that if Israel used Syrian or Jordanian airspace to attack Iraq, they would intervene in the war on Iraq's side or attack Israel. The coalition promised to deploy [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot missiles]] to defend Israel if it refrained from responding to the Scud attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh, ''The Gulf Conflict: Diplomacy and War in the New World Order'', 1990–1991 (Princeton, 1993), 331–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Gordon, ''Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scud missiles targeting Israel were relatively ineffective, as firing at extreme range resulted in a dramatic reduction in accuracy and payload. According to the [[Jewish Virtual Library]], a total of 74 Israelis died as a result of the Iraqi attacks: two directly and the rest from suffocation and heart attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;JVL&quot;&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Gulf_War.html The Gulf War]&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 230 Israelis were injured.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fetter |first1=Steve |last2=Lewis |first2=George N. |last3=Gronlund |first3=Lisbeth  |title=Why were Casualties so low? |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=361 |pages=293–296 |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |location=London |date=28 January 1993 |url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/4282/1/1993-Nature-Scud.pdf |doi=10.1038/361293a0 |issue=6410 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive property damage was also caused, and according to Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, &quot;Damage to general property consisted of 1,302 houses, 6,142 apartments, 23 public buildings, 200 shops and 50 cars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/history/pages/the%20gulf%20war%20-%201991.aspx|title=The Gulf War (1991)|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was feared that Iraq would fire missiles filled with [[nerve agent]]s such as [[sarin]]. As a result, Israel's government issued [[gas mask]]s to its citizens. When the first Iraqi missiles hit Israel, some people injected themselves with an antidote for nerve gas. It has been suggested that the sturdy construction techniques used in Israeli cities, coupled with the fact that Scuds were only launched at night, played an important role in limiting the number of casualties from Scud attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;publicpolicy.umd.edu&quot; /&gt;
[[File:AlHussein-Strike.JPEG|thumb|Aftermath of an Iraq Armed Forces strike on US barracks.]]

In response to the threat of Scuds on Israel, the US rapidly sent a Patriot missile air defense artillery battalion to Israel along with two batteries of [[MIM-104 Patriot]] missiles for the protection of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N60/war1.60n.html|title=Three Isrealis killed as Scuds hit Tel Aviv|publisher=[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]|year=1991|accessdate=11 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] also deployed a Patriot missile squadron to Israel and Turkey. The Dutch Defense Ministry later stated that the military use of the Patriot missile system was largely ineffective, but its psychological value for the affected populations was high.&lt;ref name=nederland2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensie.nl/landmacht/onderwijs/werkstukken_basisvorming/golfoorlog/betrokkenheid_van_nederland|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428093020/http://www.defensie.nl/landmacht/onderwijs/werkstukken_basisvorming/golfoorlog/betrokkenheid_van_nederland|archivedate=2011-04-28|title=Betrokkenheid van Nederland|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministerie van Defensie]]|year=2009|accessdate=11 January 2009|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalition air forces were also extensively exercised in &quot;Scud hunts&quot; in the Iraqi desert, trying to locate the camouflaged trucks before they fired their missiles at Israel or Saudi Arabia. On the ground, special operations forces also infiltrated Iraq, tasked with locating and destroying Scuds. Once special operations were combined with air patrols, the number of attacks fell sharply, then increased slightly as Iraqi forces adjusted to coalition tactics.

As the Scud attacks continued, the Israelis grew increasingly impatient, and considered taking unilateral military action against Iraq. On 22 January 1991, a Scud missile hit the Israeli city of [[Ramat Gan]], after two coalition Patriots failed to intercept it. Three elderly people suffered fatal heart attacks, another 96 people were injured, and 20 apartment buildings were damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kifner|first1=John|title=WAR IN THE GULF: TEL AVIV; 3 DIE 96 ARE HURT IN ISRAELI SUBURB|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/23/world/war-in-the-gulf-tel-aviv-3-die-96-are-hurt-in-israeli-suburb.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Atkinson|first1=Rick|last2=Balz|first2=Dan|title=Scud Hits Tel Aviv, Leaving 3 Dead, 96 Hurt|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/fogofwar/archive/post012291.htm|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2 June 2013|date=23 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this attack, the Israelis warned that if the US failed to stop the attacks, they would. At one point, Israeli commandos boarded helicopters prepared to fly into Iraq, but the mission was called off after a phone call from US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, reporting on the extent of coalition efforts to destroy Scuds and emphasizing that Israeli intervention could endanger US forces.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Richard: ''In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir''&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the attacks on Israel, 47 Scud missiles were fired into Saudi Arabia, and one missile was fired at Bahrain and another at Qatar. The missiles were fired at both military and civilian targets. One Saudi civilian was killed, and 78 others were injured. No casualties were reported in Bahrain or Qatar. The Saudi government issued all its citizens and expatriates with gas masks in the event of Iraq using missiles with chemical or biological warheads. The government broadcast alerts and 'all clear' messages over television to warn citizens during Scud attacks.

On 25 February 1991, a Scud missile hit a US Army barracks of the 14th Quartermaster Detachment, out of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, stationed in [[Dhahran]], Saudi Arabia, killing 28 soldiers and injuring over 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;iraqwatch.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqwatch.org/government/US/Pentagon/dodscud.htm |title=DOD: Information Paper- Iraq's Scud Ballistic Missiles |publisher=Iraqwatch.org |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia (Battle of Khafji)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
{{Main article|Battle of Khafji}}
[[File:Battle of Khafji 1991.svg|thumb|Military operations during Khafji's liberation]]

On 29 January, Iraqi forces attacked and occupied the lightly defended Saudi city of [[Khafji]] with tanks and infantry. The Battle of Khafji ended two days later when the Iraqis were driven back by the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]], supported by Qatari forces and US Marines. The allied forces used extensive artillery fire.

Both sides suffered casualties, although Iraqi forces sustained substantially more dead and captured than the allied forces. Eleven Americans were killed in two separate [[friendly fire]] incidents, an additional 14 US airmen were killed when their [[AC-130]] gunship was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile, and two US soldiers were captured during the battle. Saudi and Qatari forces had a total of 18 dead. Iraqi forces in Khafji had 60–300 dead and 400 captured.

The Battle of Khafji was an example of how air power could single-handedly hinder the advance of enemy ground forces. Upon learning of Iraqi troop movements, 140 coalition aircraft were diverted to attack an advancing column consisting of two armored divisions in battalion-sized units. Precision stand-off attacks were conducted during the night and through to the next day.  Iraqi vehicle losses included 357 tanks, 147 armored personnel carriers, and 89 mobile artillery pieces.  Some crews simply abandoned their vehicles upon realizing that they could be destroyed by guided bombs without warning, stopping the divisions from massing for an organized attack on the town. One Iraqi soldier, who had fought in the Iran-Iraq War, remarked that his brigade &quot;had sustained more punishment from allied airpower in 30 minutes at Khafji than in eight years of fighting against Iran.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2014/February%202014/0214reversal.aspx AirLand Reversal] - Airforcemag.com, February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter reconnaissance==
[[Task Force 1-41 Infantry]] was a heavy battalion task force from the 2nd Armored Division (Forward). It was the spearhead of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]]. It consisted primarily of the 1st Battalion, [[41st Infantry Regiment (United States)|41st Infantry Regiment]], 3rd Battalion, [[66th Armor Regiment]], and the 4th Battalion, [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|3rd Field Artillery Regiment]]. Task Force 1-41 was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991 and conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991.{{sfn|VUA Citation||}} Shortly after arrival in theatre Task Force 1-41 Infantry received a counter-reconnaissance mission.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-reconnaissance generally includes destroying or repelling the enemy's reconnaissance elements and denying their commander any observation of friendly forces. On 15 February 1991 4th Battalion of the [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|3rd Field Artillery Regiment]] fired on a trailer and a few trucks in the Iraqi sector that was observing American forces.&lt;ref&gt;Bourque, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 1991 several groups of Iraqi vehicles appeared to be performing reconnaissance on the Task Force and were driven away by fire from 4-3 FA.&lt;ref&gt;Bourque, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Another enemy platoon, including six vehicles, was reported as being to the northeast of the Task Force. They were engaged with artillery fire from 4-3 FA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourque, p.99&quot;&gt;Bourque, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that evening another group of Iraqi vehicles was spotted moving towards the center of the Task Force. They appeared to be Iraqi Soviet-made [[BTR (vehicle)|BTR]]s and tanks. For the next hour the Task Force fought several small battles with Iraqi reconnaissance units. TF 1-41 IN fired [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW missiles]] at the Iraqi formation destroying one tank. The rest of the formation was destroyed or driven away by artillery fire from 4-3 FA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourque, p.99&quot;/&gt; On 17 February 1991 the Task Force took enemy mortar fire, however, the enemy forces managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Bourque, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Later that evening the Task Force received enemy artillery fire but suffered no casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Bourque, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breach==
The breach was preceded by a heavy artillery barrage, led by 4th Battalion of the [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|3rd Field Artillery Regiment]]  and the [[210th Field Artillery Brigade]], to soften up Iraqi defenses. Around 300 guns from multiple nations participated in the barrage. Over 14,000 rounds of artillery and over 4,900 [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System|MLRS]] rockets were fired at Iraqi forces during these raids.&lt;ref&gt;Bourque, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;  Iraq lost close to 22 artillery battalions during the initial stages of this barrage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourque P.161&quot;&gt;Bourque P.161&lt;/ref&gt; This would include the destruction of approximately 396 Iraqi artillery pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourque P.161&quot;/&gt; By the end of these raids Iraqi artillery assets had all but ceased to exist. These raids were supplemented by air attacks by [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers and [[Lockheed AC-130|C-130]] cargo aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Bourque pp.163&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Task Force 1-41 Infantry]] was given the task of breaching Iraq's initial defensive positions along the Iraq-Saudi Arabia border. Once into Iraqi territory the Task Force encountered multiple Iraqi defensive positions and bunkers. These defensive positions were occupied by a brigade-sized element.&lt;ref name=&quot;VUA Citation&quot;&gt;Desert Storm/Shield Valorous Unit Award Citations&lt;/ref&gt; TF 1-41 IN elements dismounted and prepared to engage the enemy soldiers which occupied these well-prepared and heavily fortified bunkers.&lt;ref name=&quot;VUA Citation&quot;/&gt; The Task Force found itself engaged in six hours of combat in order to clear the extensive [[bunker]] complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;VUA Citation&quot;/&gt; The Iraqis engaged the Task Force with [[Small Arms and Light Weapons|small arms]] fire, [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]s, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire, and what was left of Iraqi [[artillery]] assets. A series of battles unfolded which resulted in heavy Iraqi casualties and the Iraqis being removed from their defensive positions with many becoming prisoners of war. Some escaped to be killed or captured by other coalition forces.&lt;ref&gt;Bourque, pp.113-133&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of clearing the bunkers Task Force 1-41 captured two brigade command posts and the command post of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourque P.259&quot;&gt;Bourque P.259&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force also captured a brigade commander, several battalion commanders, company commanders, and staff officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bourque P.259&quot;/&gt; As combat operations progressed Task Force 1-41 Infantry engaged at short range multiple dug in enemy tanks in ambush positions.{{sfn|VUA Citation||}} Task Force 1-41 earned a [[Valorous Unit Award]] for its efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;VUA Citation&quot;/&gt;

==Ground campaign==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012|This tag applies to subsections here also}}
[[File:DesertStormMap v2.svg|thumb|350px|right|Ground troop movements 24–28 February 1991 during Operation Desert Storm]]

Coalition forces dominated the air with their technological advantages. [[Air supremacy]] was achieved before the start of the main ground offensive. Coalition forces also had two key technological advantages:
#Coalition [[main battle tank]]s, such as the US [[M1 Abrams]], British [[Challenger 1]], and Kuwaiti [[M-84]]AB were vastly superior to the [[Type 69/79|Type 69]] and export-model [[T-72 operators and variants#Iraq|T-72]] tanks used by the Iraqis. Coalition crews were better trained, with more highly developed armored doctrine. Iraqi tanks were mainly employed as armored [[self-propelled artillery]], rather than in the maneuver warfare roles employed by the coalition.
# The use of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] made it possible for coalition forces to navigate without reference to roads or other fixed landmarks. This, along with aerial [[reconnaissance]], allowed them to fight a [[maneuver warfare|battle of maneuver]] rather than a [[Decisive Battle|battle of encounter]]: they knew where they were and where the enemy was, so they could attack a specific target rather than searching on the ground for enemy forces.

===Kuwait's liberation===
{{Main article|Liberation of Kuwait campaign}}
{{see also|Gulf War order of battle ground campaign}}

US decoy attacks by air attacks and naval gunfire the night before Kuwait's liberation were designed to make the Iraqis believe the main coalition ground attack would focus on central Kuwait.

For months, American units in Saudi Arabia had been under almost constant Iraqi artillery fire, as well as threats from Scud missile or chemical attacks. On 24 February 1991, the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions, and the 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City. They encountered trenches, barbed wire, and minefields. However, these positions were poorly defended, and were overrun in the first few hours. Several tank battles took place, but apart from that, coalition troops encountered minimal resistance, as most Iraqi troops surrendered. The general pattern was that the Iraqis would put up a short fight before surrendering. However, Iraqi air defenses shot down nine US aircraft. Meanwhile, forces from Arab states advanced into Kuwait from the east, encountering little resistance and suffering few casualties.

Despite the successes of coalition forces, it was feared that the Iraqi Republican Guard would escape into Iraq before it could be destroyed. It was decided to send British armored forces into Kuwait fifteen hours ahead of schedule, and to send US forces after the Republican Guard. The coalition advance was preceded by a heavy artillery and rocket barrage, after which 150,000 troops and 1,500 tanks began their advance. Iraqi forces in Kuwait counterattacked against US troops, acting on a direct order from Saddam Hussein himself. Despite the intense combat, the Americans repulsed the Iraqis and continued to advance towards Kuwait City.

Kuwaiti forces were tasked with liberating the city. Iraqi troops offered only light resistance. The Kuwaitis lost one soldier and one plane was shot down, and quickly liberated the city. On 27 February, Saddam ordered a retreat from Kuwait, and President Bush declared it liberated. However, an Iraqi unit at [[Kuwait International Airport]] appeared not to have gotten the message and fiercely resisted. US Marines had to fight for hours before securing the airport, after which Kuwait was declared secure. After four days of fighting, Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait. As part of a [[scorched earth]] policy, they [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set fire to nearly 700 oil wells]] and placed land mines around the wells to make extinguishing the fires more difficult.

===Initial moves into Iraq===
[[File:Destroyed Iraqi T-62.jpg|upright|thumb|Iraqi [[T-62]] knocked out by [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] fire]]
[[File:RemnantsofLAV25.jpg|thumb|left|Destroyed LAV-25]]

The war's ground phase was officially designated Operation Desert Saber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/desert_sabre.htm |title=Operation Desert Sabre / Gulf War Ground Campaign |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first units to move into Iraq were three patrols of the British [[Special Air Service]]'s B squadron, call signs Bravo One Zero, [[Bravo Two Zero]], and Bravo Three Zero, in late January. These eight-man patrols landed behind Iraqi lines to gather intelligence on the movements of Scud mobile missile launchers, which could not be detected from the air, as they were hidden under bridges and camouflage netting during the day.{{sfn|Riley|2010|p=207}} Other objectives included the destruction of the launchers and their fiber-optic communications arrays that lay in pipelines and relayed coordinates to the [[Transporter erector launcher|TEL]] operators that were launching attacks against Israel. The operations were designed to prevent any possible Israeli intervention. Due to lack of sufficient ground cover to carry out their assignment, One Zero and Three Zero abandoned their operations, while Two Zero remained, and was later compromised, with only Sergeant [[Chris Ryan]] escaping to Syria.

Elements of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Battalion [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th Cavalry]] of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] of the US Army performed a direct attack into Iraq on 15 February 1991, followed by one in force on 20 February that led directly through 7 Iraqi divisions which were caught off guard.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} From 15–20 February, the [[Battle of Wadi Al-Batin]] took place inside Iraq; this was the first of two attacks by 1 Battalion 5th Cavalry of the 1st Cavalry Division. It was a feint attack, designed to make the Iraqis think that a coalition invasion would take place from the south. The Iraqis fiercely resisted, and the Americans eventually withdrew as planned back into the Wadi Al-Batin. Three US soldiers were killed and nine wounded, with one M2 Bradley IFV turret destroyed, but they had taken 40 prisoners and destroyed five tanks, and successfully deceived the Iraqis. This attack led the way for the XVIII Airborne Corps to sweep around behind the 1st Cav and attack Iraqi forces to the west. On 22 February 1991, Iraq agreed to a Soviet-proposed ceasefire agreement. The agreement called for Iraq to withdraw troops to pre-invasion positions within six weeks following a total ceasefire, and called for monitoring of the ceasefire and withdrawal to be overseen by the UN Security Council.

The coalition rejected the proposal, but said that retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked,{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} and gave twenty-four hours for Iraq to withdraw their forces. On 23 February, fighting resulted in the capture of 500 Iraqi soldiers. On 24 February, British and American armored forces crossed the Iraq–Kuwait border and entered Iraq in large numbers, taking hundreds of prisoners. Iraqi resistance was light, and four Americans were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;leyden.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Leydon |url=http://www.leyden.com/gulfwar/week6.html |title=Carriers in the Persian Gulf War |publisher=Leyden.com |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coalition forces enter Iraq===

Shortly afterwards, the [[VII Corps (United States)|US VII Corps]], in full strength and spearheaded by the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, launched an armored attack into Iraq early on 24 February, just to the west of Kuwait, taking Iraqi forces by surprise. Simultaneously, the [[XVIII Airborne Corps|US XVIII Airborne Corps]] launched a sweeping &quot;left-hook&quot; attack across southern Iraq's largely undefended desert, led by the US [[3d Armored Cavalry Regiment|3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment]] and the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division (Mechanized)]]. This movement's left flank was protected by [[6th Light Armoured Brigade (France)|France's 6th Light Armoured Division Daguet]].

The French force quickly overcame Iraq's 45th Infantry Division, suffering light casualties and taking a large number of prisoners, and took up blocking positions to prevent an Iraqi counterattack on the coalition's flank. The movement's right flank was protected by the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom's 1st Armoured Division]]. Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the elite Republican Guard before it could escape. The Iraqis resisted fiercely from dug-in positions and stationary vehicles, and even mounted armored charges.

Unlike many previous engagements, the destruction of the first Iraqi tanks did not result in a mass surrender. The Iraqis suffered massive losses and lost dozens of tanks and vehicles, while US casualties were comparatively low, with a single Bradley knocked out. Coalition forces pressed another ten kilometers into Iraqi territory, and captured their objective within three hours. They took 500 prisoners and inflicted heavy losses, defeating Iraq's 26th Infantry Division. A US soldier was killed by an Iraqi land mine, another five by friendly fire, and thirty wounded during the battle. Meanwhile, British forces attacked Iraq's Medina Division and a major Republican Guard logistics base. In nearly two days of some of the war's most intense fighting, the British destroyed 40 enemy tanks and captured a division commander.

Meanwhile, US forces attacked the village of [[Muthanna Province|Al Busayyah]], meeting fierce resistance. The US force destroyed a considerable amount of military hardware and took prisoners, while suffering no casualties.

On 25 February 1991, Iraqi forces fired a Scud missile at an American barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The missile attack killed 28 US military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;twentieth century battlefields, the gulf war&lt;/ref&gt;

The coalition's advance was much swifter than US generals had expected. On 26 February, Iraqi troops began retreating from Kuwait, after they had set its oil fields on fire (737 oil wells were set ablaze). A long convoy of retreating Iraqi troops formed along the main Iraq-Kuwait highway. Although they were retreating, this convoy was bombed so extensively by coalition air forces that it came to be known as the [[Highway of Death]]. Hundreds of Iraqi troops were killed. American, British, and French forces continued to pursue retreating Iraqi forces over the border and back into Iraq, eventually moving to within 150 miles (240&amp;nbsp;km) of Baghdad, before withdrawing back to Iraq's border with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

One hundred hours after the ground campaign started, on 28 February, President Bush declared a ceasefire, and he also declared that Kuwait had been liberated.

In coalition-occupied Iraqi territory, a peace conference was held where a ceasefire agreement was negotiated and signed by both sides. At the conference, Iraq was authorized to fly armed helicopters on their side of the temporary border, ostensibly for government transit due to the damage done to civilian infrastructure. Soon after, these helicopters and much of Iraq's military were used to fight an [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|uprising in the south]]. The rebellions were encouraged by an airing of &quot;The Voice of Free Iraq&quot; on 2 February 1991, which was broadcast from a CIA-run radio station out of Saudi Arabia. The Arabic service of the Voice of America supported the uprising by stating that the rebellion was well supported, and that they soon would be liberated from Saddam.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Fisk|Fisk, Robert]]. ''[[Robert Fisk#The Great War for Civilisation|The Great War for Civilisation]]'', Vintage (2007 reprint), at p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the North, Kurdish leaders took American statements that they would support an uprising to heart, and began fighting, hoping to trigger a [[coup d'état]]. However, when no US support came, Iraqi generals remained loyal to Saddam and brutally crushed the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|Kurdish uprising]]. Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Turkey and Kurdish areas of Iran. These events later resulted in [[no-fly zone]]s being established in northern and southern Iraq. In Kuwait, the Emir was restored, and suspected Iraqi collaborators were repressed. Eventually, over 400,000 people were expelled from the country, including a large number of [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], because of [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] support of Saddam. Yasser Arafat didn't apologize for his support of Iraq, but after his death, the Fatah under Mahmoud Abbas' authority formally apologized in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4089961.stm |work=BBC News | title=Abbas apology to Kuwait over Iraq | date=12 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some criticism of the Bush administration, as they chose to allow Saddam to remain in power instead of pushing on to capture Baghdad and overthrowing his government. In their co-written 1998 book, ''[[A World Transformed]]'', Bush and [[Brent Scowcroft]] argued that such a course would have fractured the alliance, and would have had many unnecessary political and human costs associated with it.

In 1992, the US Defense Secretary during the war, Dick Cheney, made the same point:&lt;blockquote&gt;I would guess if we had gone in there, we would still have forces in Baghdad today. We'd be running the country. We would not have been able to get everybody out and bring everybody home.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of casualties. I don't think you could have done all of that without significant additional US casualties, and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And the question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties is Saddam (Hussein) worth? And the answer is, not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the President made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/192908_cheney29.html|title=&quot;Cheney changed his view on Iraq&quot;, by Charles Pope, ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', 29 September 2004|date=28 September 2004|accessdate=7 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Instead of a greater involvement of its own military, the US hoped that Saddam would be overthrown in an internal coup d'état. The CIA used its assets in Iraq to organize a revolt, but the Iraqi government defeated the effort.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

On 10 March 1991, 540,000 US troops began moving out of the Persian Gulf.

==Coalition involvement==
[[File:Various Arabic Troops during Operation Desert Storm.jpg|thumbnail|right|Coalition troops from Egypt, Syria, Oman, France and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm.]]
{{Main article|Coalition of the Gulf War}}

Coalition members included Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Kuwait, Malaysia, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tread&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H. W.|title=Don't Tread on Me|publisher=Crown Forum|year=2006|location=New York|page=384|isbn=978-1-4000-5363-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany and Japan provided financial assistance and donated military hardware, although they didn't send direct military assistance. This later became known as ''[[checkbook diplomacy]]''.

===Australia===
[[File:HMAS Sydney 1991.jpg|left|thumb|[[HMAS Sydney (FFG 03)|HMAS ''Sydney'']] in the Persian Gulf in 1991.]]

{{Main article|Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War}}

Australia contributed a Naval Task Group, which formed part of the multi-national fleet in the Persian Gulf and [[Gulf of Oman]], under '''Operation Damask'''. In addition, medical teams were deployed aboard a US [[hospital ship]], and a [[Clearance Diving Team (RAN)|naval clearance diving team]] took part in de-mining Kuwait's port facilities following the end of combat operations. While the Australian forces did not see combat, they did play a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following Kuwait's invasion, as well as other small support contributions to Operation Desert Storm. Following the war's end, Australia deployed a medical unit on [[Operation Habitat]] to northern Iraq as part of [[Operation Provide Comfort]].&lt;ref&gt;Odgers 1999, pp. 356–371.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Argentina was the only Latin American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War sending a destroyer, [[ARA Almirante Brown (D-10)]], a corvette, [[ARA Spiro (P-43)]] (later replaced by another corvette, [[ARA Rosales (P-42)]]) and a supply ship ([[ARA Bahía San Blas (B-4)|ARA ''Bahía San Blas'' (B-4)]]) to participate on the  [[United Nations]] blockade and sea control effort of the Persian Gulf. The success of Operación Alfil (&quot;English: Operation Bishop&quot;) as it was known, with more than 700 interceptions and 25,000 miles sailed in the theatre of operations helped to overcome the so-called &quot;[[Malvinas syndrome]]&quot;. Argentina was later classified as [[major non-NATO ally]] due to its contributions during the war.

===Canada===
[[File:CF-18 Cold Lake Alberta.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A fighter jet taking off from a runway|Canadian [[CF-18 Hornet]]s participated in combat during the Gulf War.]]
{{See also|Operation FRICTION}}
Canada was one of the first countries to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and it quickly agreed to join the US-led coalition. In August 1990, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] committed the [[Canadian Forces]] to deploy a Naval Task Group. The destroyers {{HMCS|Terra Nova|DDE 259|6}} and {{HMCS|Athabaskan|DDG 282|6}} joined the maritime interdiction force supported by the supply ship {{HMCS|Protecteur|AOR 509|6}} in [[Operation Friction]]. The Canadian Task Group led the coalition's maritime logistics forces in the Persian Gulf. A fourth ship, {{HMCS|Huron|DDG 281|6}}, arrived in-theater after hostilities had ceased and was the first allied ship to visit Kuwait.

Following the UN-authorized use of force against Iraq, the Canadian Forces deployed a [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet|CF-18 Hornet]] and [[Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King|CH-124 Sea King]] squadron with support personnel, as well as a [[field hospital]] to deal with casualties from the ground war. When the air war began, the CF-18s were integrated into the coalition force and were tasked with providing air cover and attacking ground targets. This was the first time since the [[Korean War]] that Canada's military had participated in offensive combat operations. The only CF-18 Hornet to record an official victory during the conflict was an aircraft involved in the beginning of the [[Battle of Bubiyan]] against the Iraqi Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morin|last2=Gimblett|first1=Jean H.|first2=Richard Howard|title=Operation Friction, 1990–1991: The Canadian Forces in the Persian Gulf|year=1997|publisher=Dundurn Press|isbn=978-1-55002-257-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Commander in the Middle East was Commodore [[Kenneth J. Summers]].

===France===

The second largest European contingent was from France, which committed 18,000 troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tread&quot;/&gt; Operating on the left flank of the US XVIII Airborne Corps, the main French Army force was the [[6th Light Armoured Brigade (France)|6th Light Armoured Division]], including troops from the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Initially, the French operated independently under national command and control, but coordinated closely with the Americans (via [[United States Central Command|CENTCOM]]) and Saudis. In January, the Division was placed under the tactical control of the XVIII Airborne Corps. France also deployed several combat aircraft and naval units. The French called their contribution [[Opération Daguet]].

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Challenger-ODS-1.JPEG|thumb|left|[[British Army]] [[Challenger 1]] main battle tank during Operation Desert Storm.]]

The United Kingdom committed the largest contingent of any European state that participated in the war's combat operations. [[Operation Granby]] was the code name for the operations in the Persian Gulf. [[British Army]] regiments (mainly with the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division)]], [[Royal Air Force]] squadrons and [[Royal Navy]] vessels were mobilized in the Persian Gulf. The Royal Air Force, using various aircraft, operated from [[Military airbase|airbases]] in Saudi Arabia. Almost 2,500 armored vehicles and 53,462 troops were shipped for action.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Chief Royal Navy vessels deployed to the Persian Gulf included [[Type 22 frigate|''Broadsword''-class frigates]], and [[Type 42 destroyer|''Sheffield''-class destroyers]], other R.N. and [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary|R.F.A.]] ships were also deployed. The light aircraft carrier [[HMS Ark Royal (R07)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']] was deployed to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Special operations forces were deployed in the form of several [[Special Air Service|SAS]] squadrons.

==Casualties==

===Civilian===
Over 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed by Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Use of Terror During Iraq's Invasion of Kuwait |url=http://www.jewishagency.org/news/content/28866}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 600 Kuwaitis went [[missing people|missing]] during Iraq's occupation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq and Kuwait Discuss Fate of 600 Missing Since Gulf War |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/09/world/fg-missing9 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=9 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq. The increased importance of air attacks from both coalition [[warplanes]] and [[cruise missiles]] led to controversy over the number of civilian deaths caused during Desert Storm's initial stages. Within Desert Storm's first 24 hours, more than 1,000 sorties were flown, many against targets in Baghdad. The city was the target of heavy bombing, as it was the seat of power for Saddam and the Iraqi forces' [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]]. This ultimately led to [[civilian casualties]].

In one noted incident, two [[USAF]] stealth planes bombed [[Amiriyah shelter bombing|a bunker in Amiriyah]], causing the deaths of 408 Iraqi civilians who were in the shelter.&lt;ref name=CSM2002&gt;Scott Peterson, [http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/1022/p01s01-wosc.htm &quot;'Smarter' bombs still hit civilians&quot;], ''Christian Science Monitor,'' 22 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes of burned and mutilated bodies were subsequently broadcast, and controversy arose over the bunker's status, with some stating that it was a civilian shelter, while others contended that it was a center of Iraqi military operations, and that the civilians had been deliberately moved there to act as [[human shield]]s.

Saddam's government gave high civilian casualty figures in order to draw support from Islamic countries. The Iraqi government claimed that 2,300 civilians died during the air campaign.{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=265}} According to the Project on Defense Alternatives study, 3,664 Iraqi civilians were killed in the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;POL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0310rm8ap2.html |title=Wages of War – Appendix 2: Iraqi Combatant and Noncombatant Fatalities in the 1991 Gulf War |publisher=Comw.org |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by Beth Osborne Daponte estimated total civilian fatalities at about 3,500 from bombing, and some 100,000 from the war's other effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toting the Casualties of War |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/feb2003/nf2003026_0167_db052.htm |work=Businessweek |date=6 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford |first=Peter |title=Bid to stem civilian deaths tested |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0409/p06s01-woiq.html |work= Christian Science Monitor |date=9 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraqi===
The exact number of Iraqi combat casualties is unknown, but is believed to have been heavy. Some estimate that Iraq sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 fatalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Robert Fisk, ''The Great War For Civilisation; The Conquest of the Middle East'' (Fourth Estate, 2005), p.853.&lt;/ref&gt; A report commissioned by the US Air Force, estimated 10,000–12,000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign, and as many as 10,000 casualties in the ground war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Keaney |first=Thomas |author2=Eliot A.

According to the Project on Defense Alternatives study, between 20,000 and 26,000 Iraqi military personnel were killed in the conflict while 75,000 others were wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;POL&quot; /&gt;

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] reports that US forces suffered 148 battle-related deaths (35 to [[friendly fire]]{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=470}}), with [[Scott Speicher|one pilot]] listed as [[Missing in action|MIA]] (his remains were found and identified in August 2009).

The largest single loss of life among coalition forces happened on 25 February 1991, when an Iraqi [[Al Hussein (missile)|Al Hussein missile]] hit a US military barrack in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 [[United States Army Reserve|US Army Reservists]] from [[Pennsylvania]]. In all, 190 coalition troops were killed by Iraqi fire during the war, 113 of whom were American, out of a total of 358 coalition deaths. Another 44 soldiers were killed and 57 wounded by [[friendly fire]]. 145 soldiers died of exploding munitions or non-combat accidents.{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=264}}

The largest accident among coalition forces happened on 21 March 1991, a Royal Saudi Air Force C-130H crashed in heavy smoke on approach to Ras Al-Mishab Airport, Saudi Arabia. 92 Senegalese soldiers and six Saudi crew members were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;92-senegalese-soldiers-die&quot; /&gt;

The number of coalition wounded in combat was 776, including 458 Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Persian Gulf War – MSN Encarta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551555_2/Arabian_Gulf_War.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwqLuiZR|archivedate=31 October 2009|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

190 coalition troops were killed by Iraqi combatants, the rest of the 379 coalition deaths being from friendly fire or accidents. This number was much lower than expected. Among the American dead were three female soldiers.

====Friendly fire====
While the death toll among coalition forces engaging Iraqi combatants was very low, a substantial number of deaths were caused by accidental attacks from other Allied units. Of the 148 US troops who died in battle, 24% were killed by friendly fire, a total of 35 service personnel.{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=207}} A further 11 died in detonations of coalition munitions. Nine British military personnel were killed in a friendly fire incident when a [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Thunderbolt II]] destroyed a group of two [[Warrior tracked armoured vehicle|Warrior]] [[Infantry fighting vehicle|IFVs]].

==Controversies==

===Gulf War Illness===
{{Main article|Gulf War syndrome}}
Many returning coalition soldiers reported illnesses following their action in the war, a phenomenon known as Gulf War syndrome or Gulf War illness. Common symptoms that were reported are chronic fatigue, Fibromyalgia, and Gastrointestinal disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gulf War Veterans' Medically Unexplained Illnesses|url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/medically-unexplained-illness.asp|publisher=U.S Department of Veteran Affairs|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and the reported birth defects. Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects. Gulf War veterans' children born after the war had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans' children born before the war. Researchers have said that they did not have enough information to link birth defects with exposure to toxic substances.&lt;ref&gt;Gulf war syndrome; higher rates of specific birth defects in gulf war veterans' children. (2003). ''Medical Letter on the CDC &amp; FDA, '', 14. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/211397084
&lt;/ref&gt;  Some factors considered as possibilities include exposure to [[depleted uranium]], [[chemical weapons]], [[anthrax vaccine]]s given to deploying soldiers, and/or infectious diseases. [[Major Michael Donnelly]], a USAF officer during the War, helped publicize the syndrome and advocated for veterans' rights in this regard.

===Effects of depleted uranium===
[[File:GWI DU map.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Approximate area and major clashes in which DU rounds were used.]]

{{Main article|Depleted uranium#Health considerations}}
Depleted uranium was used in the war in tank kinetic energy penetrators and 20–30&amp;nbsp;mm cannon [[Ammunition|ordnance]]. Significant controversy regarding the long term safety of depleted uranium exists, although detractors claim [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], [[genotoxicity|genotoxic]], and [[teratogenicity|teratogenic]] [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] effects. Many have cited its use during the war as a contributing factor to a number of instances of health issues in the conflict's veterans and surrounding civilian populations. However, scientific opinion on the risk is mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hindin R. | year = 2005 | title = Teratogenicity of depleted uranium aerosols: A review from an epidemiological perspective | url = http://www.ehjournal.net/content/4/1/17 | journal = Environmental Health | volume = 4 | issue = 1| page = 17 |pmid=16124873 | doi=10.1186/1476-069X-4-17 | pmc=1242351 | ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Marshall | first = AC | year = 2005 | title = An Analysis of Uranium Dispersal and Health Effects Using a Gulf War Case Study | publisher = [[Sandia National Laboratories]] | url = http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2005/054331.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that depleted uranium is not a significant health hazard unless it is taken into the body. External exposure to radiation from depleted uranium is generally not a major concern because the alpha particles emitted by its isotopes travel only a few centimeters in air or can be stopped by a sheet of paper. Also, the uranium-235 that remains in depleted uranium emits only a small amount of low-energy gamma radiation. However, if allowed to enter the body, depleted uranium, like natural uranium, has the potential for both chemical and radiological toxicity with the two important target organs being the kidneys and the lungs&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/guide/depletedu/health/index.cfm Depleted Uranium Health Effects].

===Highway of Death===
{{Main article|Highway of Death}}

On the night of 26–27 February 1991, some Iraqi forces began leaving Kuwait on the main highway north of [[Al Jahra]] in a column of some 1,400 vehicles. A patrolling [[Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS|E-8 Joint STARS]] aircraft observed the retreating forces and relayed the information to the DDM-8 air operations center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/jstars-back.htm |title=E-8 Joint-DEATH STAR [JSTARS&amp;#93; |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vehicles and the retreating soldiers were subsequently attacked, resulting in a 60&amp;nbsp;km stretch of highway strewn with debris—the Highway of Death.

Chuck Horner, Commander of US and allied air operations, has written:
{{quote|[By February 26], the Iraqis totally lost heart and started to evacuate occupied Kuwait, but airpower halted the caravan of Iraqi Army and plunderers fleeing toward Basra. This event was later called by the media &quot;The Highway of Death.&quot; There were certainly a lot of dead vehicles, but not so many dead Iraqis. They'd already learned to scamper off into the desert when our aircraft started to attack. Nevertheless, some people back home wrongly chose to believe we were cruelly and unusually punishing our already whipped foes.
[...]&lt;br /&gt;
By February 27, talk had turned toward terminating the hostilities. Kuwait was free. We were not interested in governing Iraq. So the question became &quot;How do we stop the killing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clancy|Horner|1999|pp=499–500}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bulldozer assault===
[[File:D7 armoured bulldozer on flatbed.jpg|thumb|228x228px|An armored bulldozer similar to the ones used in the attack.]]
Another incident during the war highlighted the question of large-scale Iraqi combat deaths. This was the &quot;[[bulldozer]] assault&quot;, wherein two brigades from the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division (Mechanized)]] were faced with a large and complex trench network, as part of the heavily fortified &quot;Saddam Hussein Line&quot;. After some deliberation, they opted to use anti-mine [[plow]]s mounted on [[tank]]s and combat earthmovers to simply plow over and bury alive the defending Iraqi soldiers. Not a single American was killed during the attack. Reporters were banned from witnessing the attack, near the neutral zone that touches the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Sloyan, Patrick.

===Palestinian exodus from Kuwait===
{{main article|Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)}}
A [[Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)|Palestinian exodus from Kuwait]] took place during and after the Gulf War. During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians voluntarily fled Kuwait during the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi occupation of Kuwait]] due to harassment and intimidation by [[Iraq]]i security forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;ir&quot;/&gt; in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=ir&gt;{{cite web|author=Shafeeq Ghabra|title=The PLO in Kuwait|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/1457|date=8 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Gulf War, the [[Kuwait]]i authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;ir&quot;/&gt; Kuwait's policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]] and the [[PLO]] with Saddam Hussein.

===Operation Southern Watch===

===Sanctions===
{{Main article|United Nations Security Council Resolution 661|Iraq sanctions}}
{{Wikisource|United Nations Security Council Resolution 661}}
On 6 August 1990, after [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraq's invasion of Kuwait]], the UN Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 661|Resolution 661]] which imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, providing for a full trade [[embargo]], excluding medical supplies, food and other items of humanitarian necessity, these to be determined by the Council's sanctions committee. From 1991 until 2003, the effects of government policy and sanctions regime led to [[hyperinflation]], widespread poverty and malnutrition.

During the late 1990s, the UN considered relaxing the sanctions imposed because of the hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis. Studies dispute the number of people who died in south and central Iraq during the years of the sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/newsline/99pr29.htm|title=Iraq surveys show 'humanitarian emergency' |date=12 August 1999|accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spagat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.rhul.ac.uk/uhte/014/Truth%20and%20Death.pdf |title=Truth and death in Iraq under sanctions |first=Michael |last=Spagat |date=September 2010 |publisher=[[Significance (journal)|Significance]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Michael |title=Sanctions on Iraq: A Valid Anti-American Grievance? |publisher=[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]] |volume=5 |issue=4 |url=http://www.iraqwatch.org/perspectives/meria-rubin-sanctions-1201.htm |pages=100–115 |date=December 2001 |authorlink=Michael Rubin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Draining of the Qurna Marshes===
{{Main article|Draining of the Qurna Marshes}}
The draining of the [[Qurna Marshes]] was an irrigation project in Iraq during and immediately after the war, to drain a large area of [[marshes]] in the [[Tigris–Euphrates river system]]. Formerly covering an area of around 3,000 square kilometers, the large complex of [[wetlands]] were almost completely emptied of water, and the local Shi'ite population relocated, following the war and [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|1991 uprisings]]. By 2000, [[United Nations Environment Programme]] estimated that 90% of the marshlands had disappeared, causing [[desertification]] of over {{convert|7500|sqmi|km2}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The draining of the Qurna Marshes also called The '''Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes''' occurred in Iraq and to a smaller degree in Iran between the 1950s and 1990s to clear large areas of the marshes in the [[Tigris-Euphrates river system]]. Formerly covering an area of around 20,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (7,700 sq mi), the large complex of wetlands was 90% drained prior to the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. The marshes are typically divided into three main sub-marshes, the [[Hawizeh Marshes|Hawizeh]], Central, and [[Hammar Marshes]] and all three were drained at different times for different reasons. Initial draining of the Central Marshes was intended to reclaim land for agriculture but later all three marshes would become a tool of war and revenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Many international organizations such as the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN Human Rights Commission]], the [[Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq]], the [[Wetlands International]], and Middle East Watch have described the project as a political attempt to force the [[Marsh Arabs]] out of the area through water diversion tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Kuwaiti oil fires===
{{Main article|Kuwaiti oil fires}}
{{see also|Environmental impact of war}}
[[File:Operation Desert Storm 22.jpg|thumb|Oil well fires rage outside Kuwait City in 1991]]
The Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by the [[Military of Iraq|Iraqi military]] setting fire to 700 oil wells as part of a [[scorched earth]] policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 after conquering the country but being driven out by coalition forces. The fires started in January and February 1991, and the last one was extinguished by November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthshots.usgs.gov/Iraq/Iraqtext|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021028200910/http://earthshots.usgs.gov/Iraq/Iraqtext|archivedate=2002-10-28|title=&quot;Iraq and Kuwait: 1972, 1990, 1991, 1997.&quot; Earthshots: Satellite Images of Environmental Change|last=Wellman|first=Robert Campbell|date=14 February 1999|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey. http://earthshots.usgs.gov|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting fires burned out of control because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews. [[Land mines]] had been placed in areas around the oil wells, and a military cleaning of the areas was necessary before the fires could be put out. Somewhere around {{convert|6|Moilbbl|m3|-4}} of oil were lost each day. Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of US$1.5 billion to Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Husain |first=T. |title=Kuwaiti Oil Fires: Regional Environmental Perspectives |year=1995 |publisher=BPC Wheatons Ltd |location=Oxford |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately ten months, causing widespread pollution.

==Cost==
The cost of the war to the United States was calculated by the US Congress to be $61.1 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.psych.cornell.edu/~fhoran/gulf/GW_cost/GW_payments.html |title=How much did the Gulf War cost the US? |publisher=People.psych.cornell.edu |date=20 May 1997 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821200403/http://people.psych.cornell.edu/~fhoran/gulf/GW_cost/GW_payments.html |archivedate=21 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About $52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries: $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf; $16 billion by Germany and Japan (which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions). About 25% of Saudi Arabia's contribution was paid in the form of in-kind services to the troops, such as food and transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; US troops represented about 74% of the combined force, and the global cost was therefore higher.

===Effect on developing countries===
Apart from the impact on [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]], the resulting economic disruptions after the crisis affected many states. The [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing states and the international community's response. A briefing paper finalized on the day that the conflict ended draws on their findings which had two main conclusions: Many developing states were severely affected and while there has been a considerable response to the crisis, the distribution of assistance was highly selective.&lt;ref name=&quot;odi.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Impact of the Gulf Crisis on Developing Countries|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5466&amp;title=gulf-crisis-impact-ldcs|work=ODI Briefing Paper|date=March 1991|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ODI factored in elements of &quot;cost&quot; which included oil imports, remittance flows, re-settlement costs, loss of export earnings and tourism. For Egypt, the cost totaled $1 billion, 3% of GDP. Yemen had a cost of $830 million, 10% of GDP, while it cost Jordan $1.8 billion, 32% of GDP.

International response to the crisis on developing states came with the channeling of aid through The Gulf Crisis Financial Co-ordination Group. They were 24 states, comprising most of the OECD countries plus some Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait. The members of this group agreed to disperse $14 billion in development assistance.

The [[World Bank]] responded by speeding up the disbursement of existing project and adjustment loans. The [[International Monetary Fund]] adopted two lending facilities – the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the Compensatory &amp; Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF). The European Community offered $2 billion{{clarify|date=August 2011}} in assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;odi.org.uk&quot; /&gt;

==Media coverage==
{{Globalize|section|date=January 2010}}
{{main article|Media coverage of the Gulf War}}
The war was heavily [[television|televised]]. For the first time, people all over the world were able to watch live pictures of [[missile]]s hitting their targets and fighters departing from aircraft carriers. Allied forces were keen to demonstrate their weapons' accuracy.

In the United States, the &quot;big three&quot; network anchors led the war's [[News broadcasting|network news]] coverage: [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Peter Jennings]], [[CBS]]'s [[Dan Rather]], and [[NBC]]'s [[Tom Brokaw]] were anchoring their evening newscasts when air strikes began on 16 January 1991. [[ABC News]] correspondent Gary Shepard, reporting live from Baghdad, told Jennings of the city's quietness. But, moments later, Shepard was back on the air as flashes of light were seen on the horizon and tracer fire was heard on the ground.

On CBS, viewers were watching a report from correspondent Allen Pizzey, who was also reporting from Baghdad, when the war began. Rather, after the report was finished, announced that there were unconfirmed reports of flashes in Baghdad and heavy [[air traffic]] at bases in Saudi Arabia. On the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, correspondent [[Mike Boettcher]] reported unusual air activity in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Moments later, Brokaw announced to his viewers that the air attack had begun.

Still, it was [[CNN]] whose coverage gained the most popularity and indeed its wartime coverage is often cited as one of the landmark events in the network's history (ultimately leading to the establishment of [[CNN International]]). CNN correspondents [[John Holliman]] and [[Peter Arnett]] and CNN anchor [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]] relayed audio reports from Baghdad's [[Rixos Al Rasheed Baghdad Hotel|Al-Rashid Hotel]] as the air strikes began. The network had previously convinced the Iraqi government to allow installation of a permanent audio circuit in their makeshift bureau. When the telephones of all of the other Western TV correspondents went dead during the bombing, CNN was the only service able to provide live reporting. After the initial bombing, Arnett remained behind and was, for a time, the only American TV correspondent reporting from Iraq.

In the United Kingdom, the [[BBC]] devoted the FM portion of its national speech radio station [[BBC Radio 4]] to an eighteen-hour rolling news format creating [[Radio 4 News FM]]. The station was short lived, ending shortly after President Bush declared the ceasefire and Kuwait's liberation. However, it paved the way for the later introduction of [[Radio Five Live]].

Two BBC journalists, [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]] and [[Bob Simpson (journalist)|Bob Simpson]] (no relation), defied their editors and remained in Baghdad to report on the war's progress. They were responsible for a report which included an &quot;infamous cruise missile that travelled down a street and turned left at a traffic light.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary : Bob Simpson |author= Peter Ruff |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/jul/31/broadcasting.guardianobituaries |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 July 2006 |accessdate=4 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers all over the world also covered the war and [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] published a special issue dated 28 January 1991, the headline &quot;WAR IN THE GULF&quot; emblazoned on the cover over a picture of Baghdad taken as the war began.

US policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the [[Vietnam War]]. The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled ''[[Annex Foxtrot]]''. Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military. Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers. Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward. This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq. This policy was heavily influenced by the military's experience with the Vietnam War, in which public opposition within the US grew throughout the war's course. It was not only the limitation of information in the Middle East; media were also restricting what was shown about the war with more graphic depictions like [[Ken Jarecke]]'s image of a burnt Iraqi soldier being pulled from the American AP wire whereas in Europe it was given extensive coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJR&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=3759 | title = Images of War| publisher = AJR| accessdate =20 July 2007 | last=Lori Robertson  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC.4528745&quot;&gt;{{cite news |ref=harv|date= 9 May 2005|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4528745.stm|title = Picture power: Death of an Iraqi soldier|publisher=BBC News| accessdate =14 October 2010 | last=Ken Jarecke's account to the BBC World Service programme|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FamousPictures&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/iraqi-soldier/| title = Famous Pictures Magazine – Iraqi Soldier| publisher = Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate =23 May 2013 | last=Lucas, Dean }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the war's coverage was new in its instantaneousness. About halfway through the war, Iraq's government decided to allow live satellite transmissions from the country by Western news organizations, and US journalists returned en masse to Baghdad. [[NBC News|NBC]]'s [[Tom Aspell]], ABC's Bill Blakemore, and CBS News' Betsy Aaron filed reports, subject to acknowledged Iraqi censorship. Throughout the war, footage of incoming missiles was broadcast almost immediately.

A British crew from CBS News (David Green and Andy Thompson), equipped with satellite transmission equipment traveled with the front line forces and, having transmitted live TV pictures of the fighting en route, arrived the day before the forces in Kuwait City, broadcasting live television from the city and covering the entrance of the Arab forces the next day.

Alternative media outlets provided views in opposition to the war.  Deep Dish Television compiled segments from independent producers in the US and abroad, and produced a ten-hour series that was distributed internationally, called [https://web.archive.org/web/20100711090755/http://www.deepdishtv.org/Series/Default.aspx?id=4 The Gulf Crisis TV Project].  The series' first program [https://archive.org/details/ddtv_50_war_oil_and_power War, Oil and Power] was compiled and released in 1990, before the war broke out. [https://archive.org/details/ddtv_56_new_world_order News World Order] was the title of another program in the series; it focused on the media's complicity in promoting the war, as well as Americans' reactions to the media coverage. In San Francisco, as a local example, Paper Tiger Television West produced a weekly cable television show with highlights of mass demonstrations, artists' actions, lectures, and protests against mainstream media coverage at newspaper offices and television stations. Local media outlets in cities across the country screened similar oppositional media.

The organization [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) critically analyzed media coverage during the war in various articles and books, such as the 1991 ''Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship was at Home''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fair.org.1518&quot;&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1518|title = Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship Was at Home|publisher = [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR)| accessdate =14 October 2010 | last=Naureckas| first= Jim |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[File:Missouri missile BGM-109 Tomahawk.JPG|thumb|right|The [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] launches a [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk missile]]. The Gulf War was the last conflict in which [[battleship]]s were deployed in a combat role (as of 2016)]]
[[Precision-guided munition]]s were heralded as key in allowing military strikes to be made with a minimum of civilian casualties compared to previous wars, although they were not used as often as more traditional, less accurate bombs. Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed while journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by.

Precision-guided munitions amounted to approximately 7.4% of all bombs dropped by the coalition. Other bombs included [[cluster bomb]]s, which disperse numerous submunitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/cluster.htm |title=Dumb Bombs |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BLU-82|daisy cutters]], 15,000-pound bombs which can disintegrate everything within hundreds of yards.

[[Global Positioning System]] units were relatively new at the time and were important in enabling coalition units to easily navigate across the desert. Since military GPS receivers were not available for most troops, many used commercially available units. To permit these to be used to best effect, the &quot;selective availability&quot; feature of the GPS system was turned off for the duration of Desert Storm, allowing these commercial receivers to provide the same precision as the military equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVgf41ic6LgC&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;ots=lNtb0Fdpys&amp;dq=gulf%20war%20gps&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q=gulf%20war%20gps&amp;f=false|title=GPS for Dummies|first=Joel|last=McNamara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Airborne early warning and control|Airborne Warning and Control System]] (AWACS) and satellite communication systems were also important. Two examples of this are the US Navy's [[Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] and the US Air Force's [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]]. Both were used in command and control area of operations. These systems provided essential communications links between air, ground, and naval forces. It is one of several reasons why coalition forces dominated the air war.

American-made color photocopiers were used to produce some of Iraq's battle plans. Some of the copiers contained concealed high-tech transmitters that revealed their positions to American [[electronic warfare aircraft]], leading to more precise bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18527456 |title=Something wrong with our **** chips today |work=The Economist |date= 7 April 2011|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scud and Patriot missiles===
[[File:Scud downed by Patriot missiles.JPEG|thumb|right|Military personnel examine the remains of a Scud]]
The role of Iraq's Scud missiles featured prominently in the war. Scud is a tactical [[ballistic missile]] that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed [[Red Army]] [[GSFG|divisions]] in [[East Germany]]. The role of the Scuds which were armed with nuclear and chemical warheads was to destroy command, control, and communication facilities and delay full mobilization of Western German and Allied Forces in Germany. It could also be used to directly target ground forces.

Scud missiles utilize inertial guidance which operates for the duration that the engines operate. Iraq used Scud missiles, launching them into both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Some missiles caused extensive casualties, while others caused little damage. Concerns were raised of possible chemical or biological warheads on these rockets, but if they existed, they were not used.

The US [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot missile]] was used in combat for the first time. The US military claimed a high effectiveness against Scuds at the time, but later analysis gives figures as low as nine percent, with forty-five percent of the 158 Patriot launches being against debris or false targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cirincione&quot;/&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Defense]], which also sent Patriot missiles to protect civilians in Israel and Turkey, later disputed the higher claim.&lt;ref name=nederland2009 /&gt; Further, there is at least one incident of a software error causing a Patriot missile's failure to engage an incoming Scud, resulting in deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/patriot.html |title=The Patriot Missile Failure |publisher=Ima.umn.edu |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the US Army and the missile manufacturers maintained the Patriot delivered a &quot;miracle performance&quot; in the Gulf War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cirincione&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Cirincione |authorlink=Joseph Cirincione |title=The Performance of the Patriot Missile in the war |url=http://www.ceip.org/files/projects/npp/resources/georgetown/PatriotPaper.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223120310/http://www.ceip.org/files/projects/npp/resources/georgetown/PatriotPaper.pdf |publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]]|date=October 1992 |archivedate=23 December 2003 | format=PDF|accessdate=4 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{reflist |group=lower-alpha |refs=
&lt;ref name=numbering&gt;
The numbering of [[Gulf War (disambiguation)|Persian Gulf conflicts]] depends on whether the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988) is referred to as the First (Persian) Gulf War (English language sources prior to the start of the Kuwait war in 1990 usually called it the Gulf War), which would make the 1990 war the Second (Persian) Gulf War. Different sources may call the conflicts by different names. The name '[[Persian Gulf]]' is itself a subject of [[Persian Gulf naming dispute|dispute]]. The start date of the Kuwait War can also be seen as either August 1990 (when Iraq's [[Saddam Hussein]] invaded [[Kuwait]]) or as January 1991 (the start of Operation Desert Storm, when the US-led coalition forced Iraq out of Kuwait), so that the war is also often called the 1991 Gulf War, the 1990-1991 Gulf War, the 1990s Gulf War, etc... This dating is also used to distinguish it from the other two [[Gulf War (disambiguation)|'Gulf Wars']].&lt;/ref&gt;
