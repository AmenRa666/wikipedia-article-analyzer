|description=[[Aerosmith]]'s &quot;Walk This Way&quot; from ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]''
|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}

&quot;'''Walk This Way'''&quot; is a song by the American [[hard rock]] band [[Aerosmith]]. Written by [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], the song was originally released as the second single from the 1975 album ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]''. It peaked at number 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in early 1977, part of a string of successful hit singles for the band in the 1970s. In addition to being one of the songs that helped break Aerosmith into the mainstream in the 1970s, it also helped revitalize their career in the 1980s when it was covered by [[rapper]]s [[Run–D.M.C.]] on their 1986 album ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]''. This cover was a touchstone for the new musical subgenre of [[rap rock]], or the melding of [[rock music|rock]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. It became an international hit and won both groups a [[Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap – Single]] in 1987.

==Production==

===Music===
The song starts out with a two measure drum beat intro by [[Joey Kramer]], followed by the well known guitar riff by Joe Perry. The song proceeds with the main riff made famous by Perry and [[Brad Whitford]] on guitar with [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]] on bass. The song continues with rapid fire lyrics by [[Steven Tyler]].

===Lyrics===
In December 1974, Aerosmith opened for [[The Guess Who]] in [[Honolulu]]. During the sound check, guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] was &quot;fooling around with riffs and thinking about [[The Meters]]&quot;, a group guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] had turned him on to. Loving &quot;their riffy [[New Orleans]] [[Funk music|funk]], especially '[[Cissy Strut]]' and '[[People Say]]'&quot;, he asked the drummer &quot;to lay down something flat with a groove on the drums.&quot; The guitar [[riff]] to what would become &quot;Walk This Way&quot; just &quot;came off [his] hands.&quot;&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite news|last1=Myers|first1=Marc|title=How Aerosmith Created 'Walk This Way': A look at how the hard-rock band, inspired in part by 'Young Frankenstein,' came up with a song that would become a top-10 hit twice|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/how-aerosmith-created-walk-this-way-1410275586|accessdate=15 September 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needing a bridge, he {{quote|played another riff and went there. But I didn't want the song to have a typical, boring 1, 4, 5 chord progression. After playing the first riff in the key of C, I shifted to E before returning to C for the verse and chorus. By the end of the sound check, I had the basics of a song.}}
When bandmate [[Steven Tyler]] heard Perry playing that riff he &quot;ran out and sat behind the drums and [they] jammed.&quot; Tyler [[scat singing|scatted]] &quot;nonsensical words initially to feel where the lyrics should go before adding them later.&quot;

When the group was halfway through recording ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]'' in early 1975 at Record Plant in [[New York City]], they found themselves stuck for material. They had written three or four songs for the album, having &quot;to write the rest in the studio.&quot; They decided to give the song Perry had come up with in [[Hawaii]] a try, but it did not have lyrics or a title yet. Deciding to take a break from recording, band members and producer Jack [Douglas] went down to [[Times Square]] to see [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''. Returning to the studio, they were laughing about [[Marty Feldman]] telling [[Gene Wilder]] to follow him in the film, saying &quot;walk this way&quot; and limping. Douglas suggested this as a title for their song.&lt;ref name=Myers /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroforceone.com/index.cfm/pk/view/cd/NAA/cdid/312697/pid/302766 |title=Walk their way &amp;#124; Aerosmith News |publisher=AeroForceOne |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But they still needed lyrics.

At the hotel that night Tyler wrote lyrics for the song, but left them in the cab on the way to the studio next morning. He says: &quot;I must have been stoned. All the blood drained out of my face, but no one believed me. They thought I never got around to writing them.&quot; Upset, he took a cassette tape with the instrumental track we had recorded and a portable tape player with headphones and &quot;disappeared into the stairwell.&quot; He &quot;grabbed a few No. 2 pencils&quot; but forgot to take paper. He wrote the lyrics on the wall at &quot;the Record Plant's top floor and then down a few stairs of the back stairway.&quot; After &quot;two or three hours&quot; he &quot;ran downstairs for a legal pad and ran back up and copied them down.&quot;&lt;ref name=Myers /&gt;

Perry thought the &quot;lyrics were so great,&quot; noting Tyler, being a drummer, &quot;likes to use words as a percussion element.&quot; He says:
{{quote|The words have to tell a story, but for Steven they also have to have a bouncy feel for flow. Then he searches for words that have a double entendre, which comes out of the blues tradition.}}

Perry always liked to wait until Tyler recorded his vocal so he &quot;could weave around his vocal attack,&quot; but Tyler wanted Perry to record first for the same reason. After a &quot;tug-of-war&quot;, Tyler's vocal was recorded first with Perry's guitar track overdubbed.&lt;ref name=Myers /&gt;

The lyrics, which tell the story of a high school boy losing his virginity, are sung quite fast by Tyler, with heavy emphasis being placed on the rhyming lyrics (e.g., &quot;so I took a big ''chance'' at the high school ''dance''&quot;).

Between the elaborately detailed verses, the chorus primarily consists of a repetition of &quot;Walk this way, talk this way&quot;.

Live in concert, Tyler often has the audience, combined with members of the band, sing &quot;talk this way&quot;. There is also a lengthy guitar solo at the end of the song, and in concert, Tyler will often harmonize his voice to mimic the sounds of the guitar.

==Legacy==
&quot;Walk This Way&quot; was one of two hit singles by the band to hit the Top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the 1970s, the other one being a re-release of &quot;[[Dream On (Aerosmith song)|Dream On]]&quot;. &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, though, helped ''Toys in the Attic'' to be the bestselling Aerosmith album, and one of the most critically acclaimed. Aerosmith's version of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; often competes with &quot;[[Sweet Emotion]]&quot; and &quot;Dream On&quot; for the title of Aerosmith's [[signature song]], being one of the band's most important, influential, and recognizable songs. The band rarely omits it from their concert setlist, still performing their classic version of the song to this day. The song has also long been a staple of rock radio, garnering regular airplay on [[mainstream rock]], [[classic rock]], and [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations. In 2009, it was named the eighth greatest hard rock song of all time by [[VH1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=spreadit.org music|url=http://music.spreadit.org/vh1-top-100-hard-rock-songs/|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fee Waybill]], [[Steve Lukather]], [[Tim Bogert]] and [[Tommy Aldridge]] covered the song for the Aerosmith tribute album ''Not the Same Old Song and Dance'' (Eagle Records, 1999).

Aerosmith reference lyrics from the song in &quot;[[Legendary Child]]&quot;. The line &quot;I took a chance at the high school dance never knowing wrong from right&quot; references lyrics from the songs &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and &quot;Adam's Apple&quot; respectively. Both songs first appeared on the album &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;.

|description=[[Run–D.M.C.]]'s &quot;Walk This Way&quot; from ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]''
|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}
In 1986, the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Run–D.M.C.]] performed a cover of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; with [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] guesting on vocals and guitars. While working on ''Raising Hell'', [[Rick Rubin]] pulled out ''Toys in the Attic'' (an album they freestyled over) and explained who Aerosmith were. While [[Joseph Simmons]] and [[Darryl McDaniels]] had no idea who Aerosmith were at that time, Rubin suggested remaking the song. Neither Simmons nor McDaniels liked the idea, though [[Jam Master Jay]] was open to it. Later, however, Run–D.M.C. covered the song. D.M.C. called it &quot;a beautiful thing&quot; in a trailer for ''[[Guitar Hero]]''.

The 1986 version of the song is often credited as helping break hip hop music into mainstream [[pop music]] as it was the first hip hop song to hit the top 5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and the remake demonstrated how elements of [[hip hop music]] can be part of [[rock music|rock]] and pop songs, harking back to the DJing of [[Afrika Bambaataa]], who would mix in tracks by the likes of [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Grand Funk Railroad]] among the more usual funk breaks. It also briefly samples the opening drum intro of the original in a middle section of the song. This version of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; charted higher on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] than the original version, peaking at number 4. It was also one of the first big hip hop singles in the UK, reaching a peak of number 8 there.

The landmark collaboration catapulted Run–D.M.C. into mainstream stardom and would influence hip hop music for years to come. The song paved the way for other pop acts to introduce elements of hip hop into their music. It pioneered the trend of rhymed/sung collaborations that is so present on American Radio from the late 1990s and 2000s to the present. The collaboration also introduced a fusion of rock and hip hop, later known as [[rap rock]], to a wide audience for the first time.

The song also marked a major comeback for Aerosmith, as they had been largely out of mainstream [[pop culture]] for several years while members were battling drug and alcohol addiction along with key members having left the band. Their 1985 comeback album, ''[[Done with Mirrors]],'' had also flopped. Aerosmith followed up &quot;Walk This Way&quot; with a string of multi-platinum albums and [[Top 40]] hits, starting with the album ''[[Permanent Vacation (album)|Permanent Vacation]]'' and single &quot;[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]&quot; in 1987. In 2008, &quot;Walk This Way&quot; was ranked number 4 on VH1's &quot;''100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop''&quot;. This version of the song is currently ranked as the 110th greatest song of all time, as well as the second best song of 1986, by [[Acclaimed Music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Acclaimed Music&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net|title=Acclaimed Music Top 3000 songs|date=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chorus of Run–D.M.C.'s cover contains a pitch alternation that Aerosmith themselves adapted in most future live performances. In collaborations, the other singer often says &quot;talk this way&quot; every alternate line of the chorus. This rap-style delivery may explain why the song worked so well as a hip hop song when it was covered eleven years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Walk their way; Boston's Aerosmith opens up for VH1's `Behind the Music' | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/156937091.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+30%2C+2002&amp;author=Sarah+Rodman&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=S.03&amp;desc=Television%3B+Walk+their+way%3B+Boston%27s+Aerosmith+opens+up+for+VH1%27s+`Behind+the+Music%27 | newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] | last=Rodman | first=Sarah | date=Aug 30, 2002 | accessdate=May 23, 2011 | pages=Scene section page 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Run–D.M.C.]] cover, a [[turntablism|turntable]] and [[drum machine]] are added in to reflect the additional hip hop influence on the record. Both the original Aerosmith version and the Run–D.M.C. cover (featuring Tyler and Perry) appear on various Aerosmith compilations as well as Run-D.M.C. albums.

The song is featured on the [[video game]] [[List of video game franchises|series]] ''[[Just Dance 2015]]''.

===Music video===
The 1986 [[music video]] for &quot;Walk This Way&quot; symbolically placed a rock band and [[Run–D.M.C.]] in a musical duel in neighboring studios before [[Steven Tyler]] literally breaks through the wall that separates them. The video then segues to the bands' joint performance on stage. The highly popular video was the first hip hop hybrid video ever played in heavy rotation on [[MTV]] and is regarded as a classic of the medium. The video was directed by Jon Small and filmed at the [[Park Performing Arts Center|Park Theater]] in Union City, New Jersey. The theater has remained largely unchanged since the video was filmed. Visitors may notice two holes in the ceiling toward the front of the stage where a light fixture was meant to be installed for the shoot.

Aside from Tyler and Perry, none of the other rock musicians in the video are the [[Aerosmith]] members; instead, they were played by Roger Lane, J. D. Malo, and Matt Stelutto—respectively rhythm guitarist, bassist, and drummer of the largely unknown hair metal outfit [[Smashed Gladys]]. According to [[VH1]]'s ''[[Pop Up Video]]'', Run–D.M.C. could not afford to use the entire Aerosmith band, just Tyler and Perry. As only Tyler and Perry had traveled to record the cover with Run–D.M.C., they were the only real Aerosmith members to appear in the video.&lt;ref&gt;This was published in Brazilian rock magazine ''Roadie Crew'', issue 100 (May 2007), in its entry for Aerosmith's ''Toys in the Attic'' (in which &quot;Walk This Way&quot; was first released), mentioning the video for the Run–D.M.C./Aerosmith joint version.&lt;/ref&gt;

The guitar that Perry is playing is a Guild X-100 Bladerunner. The Guild X100 Bladerunner was originally developed and patented by David Newell and Andrew Desrosiers of David Andrew Guitars. The patent was licensed to Guild Guitars for 17 years and reverted to public domain in 2006.  During initial manufacture, Newell and Desrosiers worked directly with Guild craftsman to develop the final product. The guitar used in this video was one of these early issues.

In 2007, British [[girl group]]s [[Girls Aloud]] and [[Sugababes]] recorded a cover of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; as the official [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] [[charity single]]. Their version was produced by American producer [[Dallas Austin]], making it Girls Aloud's first single not to be produced by [[Xenomania]]. The track charted at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], giving Girls Aloud their third number 1 and Sugababes their fifth.

The music video was a comic re-enactment of the Run–D.M.C. video. &quot;Walk This Way&quot; was promoted through numerous live appearances and has been included on tours by both Girls Aloud and Sugababes. Contemporary music critics criticised the cover version, but supported the single due to its fundraising nature.

While the Run–D.M.C. cover is nearly identical to the original version, the Girls Aloud/Sugababes version has a few changes tweaked into the song; the additional line &quot;Walk this way, you wanna talk this way&quot; is added, the [[vocoder]] is added, the rap breakdown, the lyrics are moved around, and the beat is slightly sped up and realized on a drum machine to add a further [[dance-pop]] feel to the song.

===Background and release===
The idea of a Girls Aloud and Sugababes collaboration came from Comic Relief co-founder and trustee [[Richard Curtis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boxset&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=The Singles Boxset |others=[[Girls Aloud]] |year=2009 |chapter=Walk This Way |first=Peter |last=Robinson |authorlink=Peter Robinson (journalist) |page=35 |type=Booklet |publisher=[[Fascination Records]] |location=London, England }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several songs were possibilities, including [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s &quot;[[Girls &amp; Boys (Blur song)|Girls &amp; Boys]]&quot; and [[Candi Staton]]'s &quot;[[You Got the Love]]&quot;, which was Girls Aloud member [[Nicola Roberts]]' idea and favourite choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxset&quot;/&gt; &quot;Walk This Way&quot; is notably the first Girls Aloud single to date not to feature production from [[Brian Higgins (producer)|Brian Higgins]] and [[Xenomania]], who have also worked with Sugababes.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxset&quot;/&gt; Girls Aloud and Sugababes launched the charity appeal on January 31.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6317377.stm | title=Girl groups get red noses rolling | work=[[BBC News]] | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=January 31, 2007 | accessdate=August 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kimberley Walsh]] of Girls Aloud said, &quot;It's a fantastic song and hopefully will raise tons of money for people living in really difficult situations here and in Africa.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;.

&quot;Walk This Way&quot; is taken from Girls Aloud's ''Defenders of Anarchy'' re-release.

The single was released on March 12, 2007 on just one [[CD single]] format, which included a remix of the single and its music video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.discogs.com/Sugababes-Vs-Girls-Aloud-Walk-This-Way/release/1292240 | title=Sugababes Vs Girls Aloud - Walk This Way (CD, Single, Enh) | work=[[Discogs]] | publisher=Zink Media | accessdate=August 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also available as a [[Music download|digital download]].

===Music video===
The music video premiered on [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] on February 2, 2007, and was shown on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Popworld]]'' the following day. The video was filmed over three days in January 2007 – Sugababes on the first, [[Cheryl Cole]], [[Nicola Roberts]], and [[Kimberley Walsh]] on the second, and [[Nadine Coyle]] and [[Sarah Harding]] on the third and final day.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxset&quot;/&gt; The premise of the video was a comic re-enactment of the [[Run-D.M.C.]] video, with Girls Aloud as the rockers and Sugababes as Run–D.M.C.
