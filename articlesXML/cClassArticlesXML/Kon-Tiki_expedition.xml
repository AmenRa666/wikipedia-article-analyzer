{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Kon-Tiki'' expedition}}
[[File:Kon-Tiki.jpg|thumb|250px|''Kon-Tiki'', 1947]]
The '''''Kon-Tiki'' expedition''' was a 1947 journey by [[raft]] across the Pacific Ocean from South America to the Polynesian islands, led by Norwegian explorer and writer [[Thor Heyerdahl]]. The raft was named ''Kon-Tiki'' after the [[Inca]] sun god, [[Viracocha]], for whom &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; was said to be an old name. ''[[The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas|Kon-Tiki]]'' is also the name of Heyerdahl's book; the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award-winning]] [[Kon-Tiki (1950 film)|documentary film]] chronicling his adventures; and [[Kon-Tiki (2012 film)|the 2012 dramatised feature film]] nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in [[pre-Columbian]] times. His aim in mounting the ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition was to show, by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at the time, that there were no technical reasons to prevent them from having done so. Although the expedition carried some modern equipment, such as a radio, watches, charts, [[sextant]], and metal knives, Heyerdahl argued they were incidental to the purpose of proving that the raft itself could make the journey.

The ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition was funded by private loans, along with donations of equipment from the [[United States Army]]. Heyerdahl and a small team went to [[Peru]], where, with the help of dockyard facilities provided by the Peruvian authorities, they constructed the raft out of [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] logs and other native materials in an indigenous style as recorded in illustrations by Spanish [[conquistadores]]. The trip began on April 28, 1947. Heyerdahl and five companions sailed the raft for 101 days over 6900&amp;nbsp;km (4,300 miles) across the Pacific Ocean before smashing into a [[reef]] at [[Raroia]] in the [[Tuamotu Islands]] on August 7, 1947. The crew made successful landfall and all returned safely.

Thor Heyerdahl's book about his experience became a bestseller. It was published in Norwegian in 1948 as ''The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas'', later reprinted as ''Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft''. It appeared with great success in English in 1950, also in many other languages.  A documentary [[motion picture]] about the expedition, also called ''Kon-Tiki'' was produced from a write-up and expansion of the crew's filmstrip notes and won an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award]] in 1951. It was directed by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] and edited by [[Olle Nordemar]]. The voyage was also chronicled in the documentary TV-series ''The Kon-Tiki Man: The Life and Adventures of Thor Heyerdahl'', directed by Bengt Jonson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kon-tiki.no/Events/indexold.html ''The Kon-Tiki Man'' episode breakdown] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028203635/http://www.kon-tiki.no/Events/indexold.html |date=October 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original ''Kon-Tiki'' raft is now on display in the [[Kon-Tiki Museum]] at [[Bygdøy]] in [[Oslo]].

== Crew ==
''Kon-Tiki'' had a six-man crew, all of whom were Norwegian except for Bengt Danielsson, a Swede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2ysYAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Watzinger+Raaby+Haugland&amp;dq=Watzinger+Raaby+Haugland |title=The Kon-Tiki Expedition  |first=Thor  |last=Thor Heyerdahl |publisher=Rand McNally|year= 1968 |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thor Heyerdahl]] (1914–2002) was the expedition leader. He was also the author of the book of the expedition and the narrator of the story. Heyerdahl had studied the ancient people of South America and Polynesia and believed that there was a link between the two.
* [[Erik Hesselberg]] (1914–1972) was the navigator and artist. He painted the large Kon-Tiki figure on the raft's sail. His children's book ''Kon-Tiki and I'' appeared in Norwegian in 1949 and has since been published in more than 15 languages.
* [[Bengt Danielsson]] (1921–1997) took on the role of steward, in charge of supplies and daily rations.  Danielsson was a Swedish sociologist interested in [[human migration|human migration theory]].  He also served as translator, as he was the only member of the crew who spoke Spanish. He was also a voracious reader; his box aboard the raft contained many books.
* [[Knut Haugland]] (1917–2009) was a radio expert, decorated by the British in World War II for actions in the [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]] that stalled what were believed to be Germany's plans to develop an [[atomic bomb]]. Haugland was the last surviving crew member; he died on Christmas Day, 2009 at the age of 92.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/last-crew-member-on-kon-tiki-expedition-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Torstein Raaby]] (1918–1964) was also in charge of radio transmissions. He gained radio experience while hiding behind German lines during WWII, spying on the German battleship ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]''. His secret radio transmissions eventually helped guide in Allied bombers to sink the ship.
* [[Herman Watzinger]] (1910–1986) was an engineer whose area of expertise was in technical measurements.  He was the first to join Heyerdahl for the trip. He collected and recorded all sorts of data on the voyage. Much of what he recorded, such as weather data, was sent back to various people, since this area of the ocean was largely unstudied.

The expedition also carried a pet [[parrot]] named Lorita.

==Construction==
The main body of the float was composed of nine [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] tree trunks up to {{convert|45|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|2|ft|cm|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in diameter, lashed together with {{convert|1+1/4|in|mm|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[hemp]] ropes. Cross-pieces of balsa logs {{convert|18|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter were lashed across the logs at {{convert|3|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} intervals to give lateral support. [[Pine]] splashboards clad the bow, and lengths of pine {{convert|1|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|2|ft|cm|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide were wedged between the balsa logs and used as [[centreboard]]s.

The main mast was made of lengths of mangrove wood lashed together to form an A-frame {{convert|29|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high. Behind the main-mast was a cabin of plaited bamboo {{convert|14|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|8|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide was built about {{convert|4|-|5|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high, and roofed with banana leaf thatch. At the stern was a {{convert|19|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long steering oar of mangrove wood, with a blade of fir. The main sail was {{convert|15|by|18|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} on a yard of bamboo stems lashed together. Photographs also show a top-sail above the main sail, and also a mizzen-sail, mounted at the stern.

The raft was partially decked in split bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LxMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Guardian+Rios&amp;dq=Guardian+Rios |title=Kon-Tiki: across the Pacific by raft|page=63 |first=Thor |last= Heyerdahl |publisher=Rand McNally |year= 1984|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main spars were a laminate of wood and reeds and Heyerdahl tested more than twenty different composites before settling on one that proved an effective compromise between bulk and torsional rigidity. No metal was used in the construction.

==Supplies==
''Kon-Tiki'' carried {{convert|275|USgal|l|order=flip}} of drinking water in 56 water cans, as well as a number of sealed bamboo rods. The purpose stated by Heyerdahl for carrying modern and ancient containers was to test the effectiveness of ancient water storage. For food ''Kon-Tiki'' carried 200 [[coconut]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, [[calabash|bottle gourds]] and other assorted fruit and roots. The [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps]] provided [[field ration]]s, tinned food and survival equipment. In return, the ''Kon-Tiki'' explorers reported on the quality and utility of the provisions. They also caught plentiful numbers of fish, particularly [[flying fish]], &quot;[[mahi-mahi|dolphin fish]]&quot;, [[yellowfin tuna]], [[bonito]] and [[shark]].

==Communications==
The expedition carried an [[amateur radio]] station with the call sign of LI2B operated by former [[World War II]] [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]] radio operators Knut Haugland and Torstein Raaby.&lt;ref name=&quot;arrlDec1947&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=QST |title=Kon-Tiki Communications – Well Done! |date=December 1947 |author=Anonymous |pages=69, 143–48 |publisher=The [[American Radio Relay League]]}}([http://p1k.arrl.org/cgi-bin/topdf.cgi?id=28028&amp;pub=qst pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;  Haugland and Raaby maintained regular communication with a number of American, Canadian, and South American stations that relayed ''Kon Tiki's'' status to the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C. On August 5, Haugland made contact with a station in Oslo, Norway, {{convert|10000|mi|km|order=flip}} away.&lt;ref name=&quot;arrl&quot;&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/features/2003/03/05/1/?nc=1 ''An LA, as in Norway, Story, by Bob Merriam, W1NTE''], March 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2002/04/24/1/ ''Thor Heyerdahl of Kon-Tiki fame dies at 87''], April 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kon Tiki's'' transmitters were powered by batteries and a hand-cranked generator and operated on the [[40-meter band|40]], [[20-meter band|20]], [[10-meter band|10]], and [[6-meter band]]s. Each unit was water resistant, used [[List of vacuum tubes#2E30|2E30]] [[vacuum tube]]s, and provided approximately 6 [[watt]]s of [[radio frequency|RF]] output; the equivalent of a small [[flashlight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heyerdahl2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Thor Heyerdahl|title=Kon-Tiki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_rby49uet8UC&amp;pg=PT148|accessdate=29 August 2013|date=7 May 2013|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-8592-3|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two British 3-16&amp;nbsp;MHz Mark II transmitters were also carried on board, as was a VHF transmitter for communicating with aircraft and a hand-cranked [[Survival radio]] of the Gibson Girl type for 500 and 8280&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=&quot;arrlDec1947&quot; /&gt;

The radio receiver used throughout the voyage, a [[National Radio Company]] NC-173, once required a thorough drying out after being soaked during a shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~postr/bapix/NC173.htm |title=Boatanchor Pix, National NC-173 |publisher=Oak.cats.ohiou.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An &quot;all well, all well&quot; message was sent via LI2B to notify would-be rescuers of the crew's safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2002/04/24/1/ ''Thor Heyerdahl of Kon-Tiki fame dies at 87''] April 24, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The call sign LI2B was used by Heyerdahl again in 1969–70, when he built a papyrus reed raft and sailed from Morocco to Barbados in an attempt to show a possible link between the civilization of ancient Egypt and the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thor Heyerdahl|title=The Ra Expeditions|edition=English|year=1971
|location=New York|publisher=Doubleday and Company|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The voyage==
''Kon-Tiki'' left [[Callao]], [[Peru]], on the afternoon of April 28, 1947. To avoid coastal traffic it was initially towed {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} out by the Fleet Tug ''Guardian Rios'' of the [[Peruvian Navy]], then sailed roughly west carried along on the [[Humboldt Current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LxMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Guardian+Rios&amp;dq=Guardian+Rios |title=Kon-Tiki: across the Pacific by raft|page=98 |first=Thor |last= Heyerdahl |publisher=Rand McNally |year= 1984|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew's first sight of land was the atoll of [[Puka-Puka]] on July 30. On August 4, the 97th day after departure, ''Kon-Tiki'' reached the Angatau atoll. The crew made brief contact with the inhabitants of [[Fangatau|Angatau Island]], but were unable to land safely. Calculations made by Heyerdahl before the trip had indicated that 97 days was the minimum amount of time required to reach the Tuamotu islands, so the encounter with Angatau showed that they had made good time.

On August 7, the voyage came to an end when the raft struck a reef and was eventually beached on an uninhabited islet off [[Raroia]] [[atoll]] in the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu]] group. The team had travelled a distance of around {{convert|6980|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}} in 101 days, at an average speed of {{convert|1.5|kn|km/h mph|1}}.

After spending a number of days alone on the tiny islet, the crew was greeted by men from a village on a nearby island who arrived in canoes, having seen washed-up flotsam from the raft. The crew were taken back to the native village, where they were feted with traditional dances and other festivities. Finally the crew were taken off Raroia to [[Tahiti]] by the French schooner ''Tamara'', with the salvaged ''Kon-Tiki'' in tow.

== Anthropology ==
[[Image:Kneeled moai Easter Island.jpg|thumb|A [[moai]]]]
Heyerdahl believed that the original inhabitants of [[Easter Island]] were the migrants from Peru. He argued that the monumental statues known as [[moai]] resembled sculptures more typical of pre-Columbian Peru than any Polynesian designs. He believed that the Easter Island myth of a power struggle between two peoples called the [[Hanau epe]] and [[Hanau momoko]] was a memory of conflicts between the original inhabitants of the island and a later wave of Native Americans from the Northwest coast, eventually leading to the annihilation of the Hanau epe and the destruction of the island's culture and once-prosperous economy.&lt;ref&gt;Heyderdahl, Thor. ''Easter Island – The Mystery Solved''. Random House New York 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Rose&quot;&gt;Robert C. Suggs, &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot;, in Rosemary G. Gillespie, D. A. Clague (eds), ''Encyclopedia of Islands'', University of California Press, 2009, pp. 515–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians consider that the Polynesians from the west were the original inhabitants and that the story of the Hanau epe is either pure myth, or a memory of internal tribal or class conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;William R.

Fischer, Island at the End of the World: The Turbulent History of Easter Island, Reaktion Books, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Professor Erik Thorsby of the [[University of Oslo]] presented DNA evidence to the [[Royal Society]] which whilst agreeing with the west origin also identified a distinctive but smaller genetic contribution from South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Alleyne&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8582150/Kon-Tiki-explorer-was-partly-right-Polynesians-had-South-American-roots.html|title=Kon-Tiki explorer was partly right – Polynesians had South American roots|publisher=Daily Telegraph|author=Richard Alleyne|date=17 Jun 2011|accessdate=17 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result was questioned in 2012 because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Did Easter Islanders Mix It Up With South Americans?|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/02/did-easter-islanders-mix-it-south-americans|accessdate = 2015-10-25|publisher = [[Science (journal)|Science Magazine]]|date = 2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 further work by a team including Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas (from the Natural History Museum of Denmark) analysed the genomes of 27 native [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] people and found that their DNA was on average 76 per cent Polynesian, eight per cent Native American and 16 per cent European. Analysis showed that: &quot;although the European lineage could be explained by contact with white Europeans after the island was “discovered” in 1722 by Dutch sailors, the South American component was much older, dating to between about 1280 and 1495, soon after the island was first colonised by Polynesians in around 1200.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New findings show more contact between prehistoric humans|url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/new-discoveries-show-more-contact-between-farflung-prehistoric-humans-than-had-been-thought-9814377.html|accessdate = 2015-10-25|date = 2014-10-23|website = The Independent|quote = Evidence found of contact between Easter Islanders and South America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later recreations of ''Kon-Tiki'' ==

===''Seven Little Sisters''===
In 1954 [[William Willis (sailor)|William Willis]] sailed alone on a raft ''Seven Little Sisters'' from [[Peru]] to [[American Samoa]], successfully completing the journey.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, William (1955). ''The Epic Voyage of the Seven Little Sisters: A 6700 Mile Voyage Alone Across the Pacific''. London: Hutchinson&lt;/ref&gt; He sailed {{convert|6,700|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, which was {{convert|2,200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} farther than ''Kon-Tiki''. In a second great voyage ten years later, he rafted {{convert|11000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from South America to Australia with a metal raft ''Age Unlimited''.

===''Kantuta''===
In 1955, the Czech explorer and adventurer [[Eduard Ingris]] attempted to recreate the ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition on a balsa raft called ''[[Kantuta Expeditions|Kantuta]]''. His first expedition, ''Kantuta I'', took place in 1955–1956 and led to failure. In 1959 Ingris built a new balsa raft, ''Kantuta II'', and tried to repeat the previous expedition. The second expedition was a success. Ingris was able to cross the Pacific Ocean on the balsa raft from Peru to Polynesia.

===''Tahiti-Nui''===
A French seafarer, [[Éric de Bisschop]], committed himself in a project he had had for some years: he built a Polynesian raft in order to cross the eastern Pacific Ocean from [[Tahiti]] to [[Chile]] (contrary to [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s crossing); the ''Tahiti-Nui'' left [[Papeete]] with a crew of five on November 8, 1956. When near the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] (Chile) in May 1957, the raft was in a very poor state and they asked for a towing, but it was damaged during the operation and had to be abandoned, but they could keep all the equipment aboard.

===''Tahiti-Nui II''===
A second ''Tahiti-Nui'' was built in [[Constitución, Chile]]; they left on April 13, 1958, towards [[Callao]], then towards the Marquesas, but they missed their target (after 4 months, it began to sink). His crew built a new smaller raft, the ''Tahiti Nui III'', in the ocean out of the more buoyant parts of the ''Tahiti Nui II''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric de Bisschop and James Wharram – Catamaran pioneers|url=http://wharram.com/site/about/eric-de-bisschop_en|work=James Wharram Designs|publisher=James Wharram Designs|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were swept along towards [[Cook Islands]] where on August 30, the raft went aground and was wrecked at [[Rakahanga]] atoll. Eric de Bisschop was the only person who died in this accident.

===''Tangaroa''===
A Peruvian expedition led by [[Carlos Caravedo]] crossed the Pacific Ocean in 1965 in 115 days in a raft named ''Tangaroa'', of which 18 days were used by the crew to cross [[Tuamotus]], the Tuamotu Archipielago, making ''Tangaroa'' the only raft that has managed to cross that dangerous archipelago of [[French Polynesia]] by its own means. On November 18, 1965, the ''Tangaroa'' ended its journey on the [[Fakarava]] island. Fakarava is where the ''Tangaroa'' is currently preserved.

===Las Balsas===
The 1973 [[Las Balsas]] expedition was the first (and so far only) multiple-raft crossing of the Pacific Ocean in recent history. It is the longest-known raft voyage in history. The expedition was led by Spaniard [[Vital Alsar]], who, in 1970, led the [[La Balsa]] expedition, only on that occasion with one raft and three companions. The crossing was successful and, at the time, the longest raft voyage in history, until eclipsed in 1973 by Las Balsas. The purpose of the 1973 expedition was three-fold: (1) to prove that the success of 1970 was no accident, (2) to test different currents in the sea, which Alsar maintained ancient mariners knew as modern humans know road maps, and (3) to show that the original expeditions, directed perhaps toward trade or colonisation, may have consisted of small fleets of balsa rafts.

===''Tangaroa''===
[[File:Tangaroa 1.jpg|thumb|''Tangaroa'' anchored by [[Stavern]], Norway]]

In 2006, the [[Tangaroa Expedition]] recreated the ''Kon-Tiki'' voyage using a newly built raft, the ''[[Tangaroa]]'', named after the Māori sea-god [[Tangaroa]]. Tangaroa's six-man crew was led by Norwegian [[Torgeir Sæverud Higraff|Torgeir Higraff]] and included Olav Heyerdahl, grandson of Thor Heyerdahl, Bjarne Krekvik (captain), Øyvin Lauten (executive officer), Swedish Anders Berg (photographer) and Peruvian Roberto Sala.&lt;ref&gt;Tangaroa Crew. Azerbaijan International, Vol 14:4 (Winter 2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Tangaroa was launched on the same day that Kon-Tiki had been—April 28—and it reached its destination on July 7, which was 30 days faster than Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki which had taken 101 days for the voyage.
