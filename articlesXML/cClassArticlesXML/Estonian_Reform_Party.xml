The party is led by [[Taavi Rõivas]], the current [[Prime Minister of Estonia]], and has 30 members in the 101-member [[Riigikogu]], making it the largest party in the legislature. The Estonian Reform Party has participated in the government of [[Estonia]] for all but three years since its foundation in 1994.

The party was founded by then-President of the [[Bank of Estonia]] [[Siim Kallas]] as a split from [[National Coalition Party Pro Patria]]. At the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1995|1995 election]], it won 19 seats in the Riigikogu, making it the second largest party. The Reform Party replaced the [[Estonian Centre Party]] in government in autumn 1995, and remained there until 1996. [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1999|In 1999]], the party lost a seat, but returned to the cabinet in coalition with the [[Pro Patria Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|People's Party Moderates]]. The party has remained in various coalitions since then, with [[Andrus Ansip]] as Prime Minister since 2005. At the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 election]], the party won 31 seats, becoming the largest party for the first time, and increased its seat tally again [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2011|in 2011]], with 33 seats. It narrowly won the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 general election]], losing 3 mandates compared to its 2011 result, ending up with 30 seats.

As the Reform Party has participated in most of the government coalitions in Estonia since the mid-1990s, its influence has been significant, especially regarding Estonia's [[free market]] and low taxes policies. The party has been a full member of [[Liberal International]] since 1996, having been an observer member between 1994–1996, and a full member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) Party. The founder and the first chairman of the Reform Party, [[Siim Kallas]], was a Commissioner of the [[European Commission]] between 2004 and 2014. He was also one of the five Vice Presidents of the [[Barroso Commission]].

==History==
The Estonian Reform Party was founded on 18 November 1994,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugajski 64&quot;&gt;Bugajski (2002), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; joining together the [[Reform Party (Estonia, 1994)|Reform Party]] — a splinter from the [[Pro Patria National Coalition]] (RKEI) — and the [[Estonian Liberal Democratic Party]] (ELDP). The new party, which had 710 members at its foundation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugajski 64&quot; /&gt; was led by [[Siim Kallas]], who had been President of the [[Bank of Estonia]] and previously uninvolved in politics. Kallas was untainted{{POV check inline|date=March 2016}} by association with [[Mart Laar]]'s government, but was widely seen as a proficient central bank governor, having overseen the successful introduction of the [[Estonian kroon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nørgaard 75&quot;&gt;Nørgaard (1999), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;  The party formed ties with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] of Germany, the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] of Sweden, Finland's [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]], and Latvia's [[Latvian Way]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugajski 64&quot; /&gt;

===Siim Kallas===
[[File:Siim Kallas 6.JPG|thumb|[[Siim Kallas]], former Vice President of the [[EU Commission]] and [[European Commissioner for Transport]]]]
Siim Kallas was leader of the Reform Party from 1994 to 2004. He was [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] from 2002-03.

In the party's first parliamentary election, [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1995|in March 1995]], it won 19 seats: catapulting it into second place, behind the [[Estonian Coalition Party|Coalition Party]]. [[Tiit Vähi]] tried to negotiate a coalition with the Reform Party, but the talks broke down over economic policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Consolidation of Democracy in East-Central Europe |first1=Karen |last1=Dawisha |first2=Bruce |last2=Parrott |year=1999 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-85898-837-5 |page=352 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRkpNovMd_cC |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Reform Party opposing [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and supporting the maintenance of Estonia's [[flat tax|flat-rate income tax]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Nørgaard 75&quot; /&gt;  While the Coalition Party formed a new government with the [[Estonian Centre Party|Centre Party]] at first, a taping scandal involving Centre Party leader [[Edgar Savisaar]] led to the Reform Party replacing the Centre Party in the coalition in November 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa 336&quot;&gt;Europa Publications (1998), p 336&lt;/ref&gt;  Kallas was appointed as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Estonia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], with five other Reform Party members serving in the cabinet. The Reform Party left the government in November 1996 after the Coalition Party signed a cooperation agreement with the Centre Party without consulting them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa 336&quot; /&gt;

At the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1999|1999 election]], the Reform Party dropped one seat to 18, finishing third behind the Centre Party and the conservative [[Pro Patria Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugajski 52&quot;&gt;Bugajski (2002), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  The ER formed a [[centre-right]] coalition with the Pro Patria Union and the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Moderates]], with Mart Laar as Prime Minister and Siim Kallas as [[Minister of Finance (Estonia)|Minister of Finance]], and with [[Toomas Savi]] returned as Speaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugajski 52&quot; /&gt;  Although the coalition was focused on [[European Union|EU]] and [[NATO]] accession, the Reform Party successfully delivered its manifesto pledge to abolish [[corporate tax]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugajski 52&quot; /&gt; one of its most notable achievements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berglund 67&quot;&gt;Berglund et al (2004), p 67&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Estonian local elections, 1999|October 1999 local elections]], the three parties replicated their alliance in [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref&gt;Bugajski (2002), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The party served in government again from March 1999 to December 2001 in a tripartite government with [[Pro Patria Union]] and [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|People's Party Moderates]], from January 2002 to March 2003 with the [[Estonian Centre Party]], from March 2003 to March 2005 with Res Publica and People's Union, from March 2005 to March 2007 with the Centre Party and People's Union, from March 2007 to May 2009 with the [[Pro Patria and Res Publica Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]]. From May 2009 the Reform Party was in a coalition government with the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union.

===Andrus Ansip===
[[File:Portrait_Andrus_Ansip.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Prime Minister of Estonia [[Andrus Ansip]]]]
[[Andrus Ansip]] was Prime Minister of Estonia from April 2005 to March 2014. After the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]] the party held 31 out of 101 seats in the [[Riigikogu]], after receiving 153,040 votes (28% of the total), an increase of +10%, resulting in a net gain of 12 seats.

===Taavi Rõivas===
[[File:Taavi Rõivas.jpg|thumb|upright|Taavi Rõivas - current PM of Estonia]]
Following the resignation of Andrus Ansip, a new [[Taavi Rõivas' cabinet|cabinet]] was installed on 24 March 2014, with [[Taavi Rõivas]] of the Reform Party serving as Prime Minister in coalition with the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/140326/estonia-swears-eus-youngest-pm-taavi-roivas/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Estonia)|2014 European elections]] held on 25 May 2014, the Reform Party won 24.3% of the national vote, returning 2 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://ep2014.vvk.ee/voting-results-en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 parliamentary election]] held on 1 March 2015, the Reform Party received 27.7% of the vote and 30 seats in the Riigikogu.&lt;ref&gt;http://rk2015.vvk.ee/voting-results.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Ideologically, the Reform Party has consistently advocated [[market liberalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berglund 67&quot; /&gt;  The Reform Party is the most economically liberal in the political landscape of Estonia.
* The party supports Estonian 0% [[corporate tax]] on re-invested income and wants to eliminate the [[dividend tax]].
* The party wanted to cut [[flat tax|flat income tax]] rate from 22% (in 2007) to 18% by 2011. Due to economic crisis the campaign for cutting income tax rate was put on hold with the tax rate at 21% in 2008 and 2009.
* The party used to oppose [[VAT]] general rate increase until late spring 2009 when it changed its position in the light of dire economic crisis and the need to find more money for budget. VAT was increased from 18% to 20% on 1 July 2009.
* The party wants subject learned during conscription to be put into the national defence class in high-school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uudised.err.ee/v/eesti/1fb7e924-e6d8-44a6-bac6-2f661e3e7395|title=Eesti Rahvus Ringhääling|work=Eesti Rahvus Ringhääling|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political support==
[[File:Estonia2007 by municipality.png|thumb|right|300px|The Estonian Reform Party is the strongest party in the area surrounding [[Tallinn]], in north-western Estonia, and is also the largest party across [[Tartu County]] in the east, as illustrated by this map of the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 election]] results.]]
The party is supported predominantly by young, well-educated, urban professionals. Unlike the Centre Party, which has disproportionate appeal amongst the [[Russians in Estonia|Russian minority]], and the [[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]], which is overwhelmingly backed by ethnic Estonians, the Reform Party attracts votes from equally across populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berglund 65&quot;&gt;Berglund et al (2004), p 65&lt;/ref&gt;  The Reform Party's vote base is heavily focused in the cities; although it receives only one-fifth of its support from [[Tallinn]], it receives three times as many votes from other cities, despite them being home to fewer than 40% more voters overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berglund 65&quot; /&gt;

Its voter profile is significantly younger than average,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kulik 153&quot;&gt;Kulik and Pshizova (2005), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; while its voters are well-educated, with the fewest high school [[Dropping out|drop-outs]] of any party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berglund 65&quot; /&gt;  Its membership is the most male-dominated of all the parties,&lt;ref&gt;Kulik and Pshizova (2005), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; yet it receives the support of more female voters than average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kulik 153&quot; /&gt;  Reform Party voters also tend to have higher incomes, with 43% of Reform Party voters coming from the top 30% of all voters by income.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berglund 65&quot; /&gt;

==Organisation==
The Reform Party has been a full member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] (formerly the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, ELDR) since December 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eldr.eu/en/about-eldr/eldr-history.php#1998 |title=History : ELDR 1976 - 2009 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]] |accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[European Parliament]], the party's one MEP — [[Kristiina Ojuland]] — sits in the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) group, while its member of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] — currently [[Margus Hanson]] — sits in the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|ALDE group]] in the Assembly. The Reform Party has been a full member of the [[Liberal International]] since 1996, having been an observer member from 1994 to 1996.

The party claims to have 10,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reform.ee/et/reformierakond/erakond/Organisatsioon |title=Organisatsioon |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Estonian Reform Party |accessdate=29 August 2011|language=et}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's [[youth wing]] is the [[Estonian Reform Party Youth]], which includes members aged 15 to 35. The organisation claims to have 4,500 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reforminoored.ee/noortekogu |title=Noortegku |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Estonian Reform Party Youth |accessdate=29 August 2011|language=et}}&lt;/ref&gt;
