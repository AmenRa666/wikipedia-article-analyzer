'''Kisan Baburao''' &quot;'''Anna'''&quot; '''Hazare''' ({{audio|Kisan Babaurao Hazare.ogg|pronunciation}}, {{audio|Anna Hazare.ogg|pronunciation}}; born 15 June 1937) is an Indian social activist who led movements to promote rural development, increase government transparency, and investigate and punish corruption in public life. In addition to organising and encouraging grassroots movements, Hazare frequently conducted hunger strikes to further his causes—a tactic reminiscent, to many, of the work of [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14540696|first=Alizeh|last=Kohari| title= Hunger strikes: What can they achieve?|agency=BBC News|date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/world/asia/19hazare.html|title=Unlikely Echo of Gandhi Inspires Indians to Act|work=The New York Times|date=18 August 2011|first=Jim|last=Yardley|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazare also contributed to the development and structuring of [[Ralegan Siddhi]], a village in [[Parner taluka]] of [[Ahmednagar district]], Maharashtra, India. He was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]]—the third-highest civilian award—by the [[Government of India]] in 1992 for his efforts in establishing this village as a model for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmabhushan_awards_list1.php?start=410|title=Padma Bhushan Awardees|accessdate=10 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423094740/http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmabhushan_awards_list1.php?start=410|archivedate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazare started a [[hunger strike]] on 5 April 2011 to exert pressure on the Indian government to enact a stringent anti-corruption law, [[The Lokpal Bill, 2011]] as envisaged in the [[Jan Lokpal Bill]], for the institution of an [[ombudsman]] with the power to deal with corruption in public places. The fast led to nationwide protests in support. The fast ended on 9 April 2011, a day after the government accepted Hazare's demands. The government issued a gazette notification on the formation of a joint committee, consisting of government and civil society representatives, to draft the legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;India activist Anna Hazare ends hunger strike&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13022337|title=India activist Anna Hazare ends hunger strike|date=9 April 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=9 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409035009/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13022337|archivedate=9 April 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Govt issues notification on committee to draft Lokpal Bill&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1637935.ece|title=Govt issues notification on committee to draft Lokpal Bill|author=PTI|date=9 April 2011|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=9 April 2011|location=[[New Delhi]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429213950/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1637935.ece|archivedate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kisan Baburao Hazare was born on 15 June 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Happy birthday Anna Hazar|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/slideshow-happy-birthday-anna-hazare-1555329|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=DNA News India|date=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (some sources say 15 January 1940&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|title=Making a difference |last=Alphons |first=K. J. |lccn=96902754 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bd3sAAAAMAAJ |year=1996 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Bhingar]], near [[Ahmednagar]]. He was the eldest son of Baburao Hazare and Laxmi Bai. He has two sisters and four brothers. He later adopted the name ''Anna'', which in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] means &quot;elder person&quot; or &quot;father&quot;.

His father worked as an unskilled labourer in Ayurveda Ashram Pharmacy{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and struggled to support the family financially. In time, the family moved to their ancestral village of [[Ralegan Siddhi]], where they owned a small amount of agricultural land. A relative took on the burden of providing Kisan with an education, taking him to Mumbai because the village had no primary school. The relative became unable financially to continue the support and Kisan's schooling ended in the Standard Seventh grade; his siblings never attended school.&lt;ref name=Satpathy2008p12/&gt; He started selling flowers at the [[Dadar]] railway station in Mumbai and eventually managed to own two flower shops in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/anna-hazare-the-guest-editor/top-headlines/I-was-re-born-in-the-battlefield-of-Khem-Karan/articleshow/8002771.cms|title=I was re-born in the battlefield of Khem Karan|newspaper=The Times of India|date=17 April 2011|accessdate=17 April 2011|last=Ghosh|first=Avijit}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became involved in vigilantism, joining groups who acted to prevent landlords' thugs from intimidating the poor out of their shelter.&lt;ref name=Seabrook1993p110/&gt;

==Military service==
Hazare was drafted in the [[Indian Army]] in April 1960, where he initially worked as an army truck driver and was later attested as a soldier.&lt;ref name=&quot;govindubiography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Govindu|first=Venu Madhav|title=Anna Hazare – a biography|url=http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~venu/ANNA/anna.html|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook army training at [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]].&lt;ref name=Satpathy2008p12&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Trishna|last1=Satpathy|first2=Aasha Kapur|last2=Mehta|date=September 2008|title=Escaping poverty: the Ralegan Siddhi case|publisher=Chronic Poverty Research Centre of Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA)|location=Hyderabad|issue=119|page=12|isbn=978-1-906433-20-8|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/127255/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/f0bdd4a1-2df8-498c-9515-66d6e87fe5c4%2Fen/WP119_KapurMehta-Satpathy.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], Hazare was posted at the border in the [[Khem Karan]] sector. He was the sole survivor of an enemy attack—variously claimed to have been a bomb, an aerial assault and an exchange of fire at the border—while he was driving a truck.&lt;ref name=Satpathy2008p12/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gosling&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo0t6BemLaMC&amp;pg=PA64|pages=64–6|title=Religion and ecology in India and Southeast Asia|last=Gosling|first=David L.|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|isbn=0-415-24031-X|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiences of wartime, coupled with the poverty from which he had come, affected him. He considered suicide at one point but turned instead to pondering the meaning of life and death.&lt;ref name=Satpathy2008p12/&gt; He said of the truck attack, &quot;[It] sent me thinking. I felt that God wanted me to stay alive for some reason. I was reborn in the battlefield of Khem Karan. And I decided to dedicate my new life to serving people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt; At a book stand in New Delhi railway station, he came across [[Swami Vivekananda]]'s booklet &quot;Call to the youth for nation building&quot; which inspired him to think deeper. He spent his spare time reading the works of [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Gandhi]], and [[Vinoba Bhave]].&lt;ref name=&quot;toi1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-07/india/29392266_1_indefinite-hunger-delays-in-government-offices-anna-hazare|title=Anna Hazare: The man who can't be ignored|newspaper=The Times of India|date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a blog post, Hazare expressed his views on [[Kashmir]] by saying that it was his &quot;active conviction that Kashmir is an integral part of India&quot; and that if required once again for service, he would remain &quot;ready to take part in war against Pakistan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/277240/ready-to-take-part-in-war-against-pakistan-if-needed-hazare/|title=Ready to take part in war against Pakistan if needed: Hazare|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=19 October 2011|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his fifteen-year career in the army (1960–75),&lt;ref name=&quot;govindubiography&quot; /&gt; Anna Hazare was posted at several locations, including [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] ([[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|Indo Pak war 1965]]), [[Nagaland]], [[Bombay]] (1971) and [[Jammu]] (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gopal Kadekodi|first=N.Antia|title=Dynamics of Rural Development: Lessons from Ralegan Siddhi|year=2002|publisher=Foundation for Research in Community Health|location=Bombay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Indo pak war, Hazare survived a road crash while driving for the army. He interpreted his survival as a further sign that his life was intended to be dedicated to service.&lt;ref name=Seabrook1993p110&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb804ulCzSMC&amp;pg=PA109|page=110|title=Victims of Development: Resistance and Alternatives|last=Seabrook|first=Jeremy|publisher=Verso|location=London|year=1993|isbn=0-86091-385-6|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had another escape in Nagaland, where one night, underground Naga rebels attacked his post and killed all the inmates. He had a miraculous escape as he had gone out to return nature's call and hence turned out to be the lone survivor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dashrath Panmand|first=Ramesh Awasthi|title=Dynamics of Rural Development: Lessons from Ralegan Siddhi|year=1994|publisher=Foundation for Research in Community Health|location=Mumbai|url=http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~venu/ANNA/anna.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official records show that he was honourably discharged in 1975 after completing 12 years of service.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-21/india/29911427_1_anna-hazare-rti-activist-indian-army Anna didn't desert Army: RTI] ''The Times of India''. Retrieved 29 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformation of Ralegan Siddhi==
Hazare returned to [[Ralegan Siddhi]], a village then described by Satpathy and Mehta as &quot;one of the many villages of India plagued by acute poverty, deprivation, a fragile ecosystem, neglect and hopelessness.&quot;&lt;ref name=Satpathy2008p9&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Trishna|last1=Satpathy|first2=Aasha Kapur|last2=Mehta|date=September 2008|title=Escaping poverty: the Ralegan Siddhi case|publisher=Chronic Poverty Research Centre of Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA)|location=Hyderabad|issue=119|page=9|isbn=978-1-906433-20-8|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/127255/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/f0bdd4a1-2df8-498c-9515-66d6e87fe5c4%2Fen/WP119_KapurMehta-Satpathy.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the villagers owned some land, cultivation was extremely difficult due to the rocky ground preventing retention of the [[monsoon]] rains, this situation was worsened by gradual environmental deterioration as trees were cut down, [[erosion]] spread and droughts were also experienced. The shortage of water also led to disease from unsanitary conditions and water reuse for multiple purposes. The economy of the village had become reliant on the illegal manufacture and sale of alcohol, a product on which many of the villagers had become dependent. Many inhabitants borrowed from [[moneylender]]s to survive, paying monthly interest rates of as much as 10%. Crime and violence (including domestic violence) had become commonplace, while education and employment opportunities were poor.&lt;ref name=Seabrook1993p110/&gt;&lt;ref name=Satpathy2008pp10-11&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Trishna|last1=Satpathy|first2=Aasha Kapur|last2=Mehta|date=September 2008|title=Escaping poverty: the Ralegan Siddhi case|publisher=Chronic Poverty Research Centre of Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA)|location=Hyderabad|issue=119|pages=10–11|isbn=978-1-906433-20-8|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/127255/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/f0bdd4a1-2df8-498c-9515-66d6e87fe5c4%2Fen/WP119_KapurMehta-Satpathy.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anna with gandhi.JPG|thumb|Anna with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] statue in [[Ralegan Siddhi]]]]

Hazare was relatively wealthy because of the [[gratuity]] from his army service. He set about using that money to restore a run-down, vandalised village temple as a focal point for the community. Some were able to respond with small financial donations but many other villagers, particularly among the elderly, donated their labour in a process that became known as ''shramdaan''. Some youths also became involved in the work and these he organised into a ''Tarun Mandal'' (Youth Association). One of the works of Vivekananda which he had read was ''Call to the youth for nation building''.&lt;ref name=Satpathy2008pp12-13&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Trishna|last1=Satpathy|first2=Aasha Kapur|last2=Mehta|date=September 2008|title=Escaping poverty: the Ralegan Siddhi case|publisher=Chronic Poverty Research Centre of Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA)|location=Hyderabad|issue=119|pages=12–13|isbn=978-1-906433-20-8|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/127255/ipublicationdocument_singledocument/f0bdd4a1-2df8-498c-9515-66d6e87fe5c4%2Fen/WP119_KapurMehta-Satpathy.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibition of alcohol===
Hazare and the youth group decided to take up the issue of alcoholism to drive a process of reform. At a meeting conducted in the temple, the villagers resolved to close down liquor dens and ban alcohol in the village. Since these resolutions were made in the temple, they became, in a sense, religious commitments. Over thirty liquor brewing units voluntarily closed their establishments. Those who did not succumb to social pressure were forced to close their businesses when the youth group smashed their premises. The owners could not complain as their businesses were illegal.&lt;ref name=Seabrook1993p250&gt;{{cite book|last=Seabrook|first=Jeremy|title=Victims of Development: Resistance and Alternatives|publisher=Verso|year=1993|page=250|isbn=0-86091-385-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb804ulCzSMC&amp;pg=PA260|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once 3 drunken villagers were tied to pillars and then [[Flagellation|flogged]], personally by Hazare with his army belt. He justified this punishment by stating that &quot;rural India was a harsh society&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Why God Saved Anna Hazare&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.readersdigest.co.in/anna-hazare?page=2|title=Why God Saved Anna Hazare|publisher=The Reader's Digest Association|last=Sivanand|first=Mohan|year=1986|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that

The child may not like the medicine, but the mother does it only because she cares for the child. The alcoholics were punished so that their families would not be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110416/jsp/opinion/story_13857544.jsp|title=Unreal Remedies – The best solution is to let existing systems start functioning again| work=The Telegraph|last=Datta-Ray|first=Sunanda|location=Calcutta|date=16 April 2011|accessdate=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hazare appealed to the government of [[Maharashtra]] to pass a law whereby prohibition would come into force in a village if 25% of the women in the village demanded it. In 2009 the state government amended the Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949 to reflect this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anna Hazare, our one, big hope, and why he can do it&quot;/&gt;

It was decided to ban the sale of tobacco, cigarettes, and [[beedi]]es (an unfiltered cigarette where the tobacco is rolled in [[Diospyros melanoxylon|tendu]] also known as [[Diospyros melanoxylon]] leaves instead of paper) in the village. To implement this resolution, the youth group performed a unique &quot;[[Holi]]&quot; ceremony twenty two years ago.{{when|date=April 2011}} The festival of Holi is celebrated as a symbolic burning of evil. The youth group brought all the tobacco, cigarettes, and beedies from the shops in the village and burnt them in a Holi fire. Tobacco, cigarettes, or beedies are no longer sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anna Hazare: India's pioneering social activist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13017897|title=Anna Hazare: India's pioneering social activist|last=Sharma|first=Kalpana|date=8 April 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 April 2011|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hazare hails govt move to ban gutkha&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19970709/19050843.html|title=Hazare hails govt move to ban gutkha|author=United News of India|date=9 July 1997|work=Indian Express|accessdate=9 April 2011|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grain Bank ===
In 1980, Hazare started the Grain Bank at the temple, with the objective of providing food security to needy farmers during times of drought or crop failure. Rich farmers, or those with surplus grain production, could donate a [[quintal]] to the bank. In times of need, farmers could borrow the grain, but they had to return the amount of grain they borrowed, plus an additional quintal as an interest. This ensured that nobody in the village ever went hungry or had to borrow money to buy grain. This also prevented distress sales of grain at lower prices at harvest time.&lt;ref name=Satpathy2008p12/&gt;

===Watershed development programme===
Ralegan Siddhi is located in the foothills, so Hazare persuaded villagers to construct a [[Catchment basin|watershed]] embankment and associated works to stop water and allow it to percolate and increase the ground water level and improve [[irrigation]] in the area. These efforts solved the problem of water scarcity in the village and made irrigation possible.&lt;ref name=Seabrook1993p110/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;toi1&quot;/&gt;

Cultivation of water-intensive crops like [[sugarcane]] was banned. Crops such as [[pulse (legume)|pulses]], [[oilseed]]s, and certain cash crops with low water requirements replaced them. The farmers started growing high-yield varieties and changed cropping pattern. Hazare has helped farmers of more than 70 villages in drought-prone regions in the state of Maharashtra since 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Activist fights Indian Corruption&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bQ4pAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U9YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6114,4477966|title=Activist fights Indian Corruption|agency=The Associated press|date=1 December 1996|newspaper=Southeast Missourian|accessdate=7 April 2011|location=Ralegan Siddhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hazare came to Ralegan Siddhi in 1975 only {{convert|70|acres}} of land was irrigated, Hazare converted it into about {{convert|2500|acres}}.&lt;ref name=Seabrook1993p250 /&gt;

===Education===
In 1932, [[Ralegan Siddhi]] got its first formal school, a single classroom primary school.{{clarify|reason=this seems to contradict other sources cited earlier, which explain why AH had to be schooled in Mumbai|date=September 2011}} In 1962, the villagers added more classrooms through community volunteer efforts. By 1971, out of an estimated population of 1,209, only 30.43% were literate (72 women and 290 men). Boys moved to the nearby towns of [[Shirur, Maharashtra|Shirur]] and [[Parner]] to pursue higher education, but girls were limited to primary education. Hazare, along with the youth of Ralegan Siddhi, worked to increase literacy rates and education levels. In 1976 they started a pre-school and a high school in 1979. The villagers formed a [[charitable trust]], the ''Sant Yadavbaba Shikshan Prasarak Mandal'', which was registered in 1979.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Removal of untouchability===
The social barriers and discrimination that existed due to the [[caste system in India]] have been largely eliminated by Ralegan Siddhi villagers. It was Hazare's moral leadership that motivated and inspired the villagers to shun [[Dalit|untouchability]] and caste discrimination. Marriages of [[Dalit]]s are held as part of community marriage program together with those of other castes. The Dalits have become integrated into the social and economic life of the village. The upper caste villagers built houses for the lower caste Dalits by ''shramdaan'' and helped to repay their loans.&lt;ref name=&quot;DEVELOPMENT WITH EQUITY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~venu/ANNA/withequity.html|title=Development with Equity|author1=Ramesh Awasthi |author2=Dashrath K.

===Gram Sabha===
The [[Gandhian philosophy]] on rural development considers the [[Gram panchayat|Gram Sabha]] as an important democratic institution for collective decision-making in the villages of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;marothia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_z4vcGrGmwC&amp;pg=PA122|title=Institutionalizing Common Pool Resources|last=Marothia|first=Dinesh K.|pages=122=8|year=2002|publisher=Concept Publishing|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7022-981-2|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazare campaigned between 1998 and 2006 for amending the Gram Sabha Act, so that villagers have a say in the village's development. The state government initially refused, but eventually gave in to public pressure. It became mandatory to seek the sanction of the Gram Sabha (an assembly of all village adults, and not just the few elected representatives in the gram panchayat) for expenditures on development works in the village.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anna Hazare, our one, big hope, and why he can do it&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moneylife.in/article/anna-hazare-our-one-big-hope-and-why-he-can-do-it/15399.html|title=Anna Hazare, our one, big hope, and why he can do it|last=Deshmukh|first=Vinita|date=7 April 2011|publisher=Moneylife|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1997 Hazare protested alleged malpractice in the purchase of powerlooms by the Vasantrao Naik Bhathya Vimukt Jhtra Governor [[P. C. Alexander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ia2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970521/14150313.html|title=Hazare trains guns on Gholap|newspaper=[[Indian Express]]|date=21 May 1997|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November 1997 Gholap filed a defamation suit against Hazare for accusing him of corruption.

Three trusts headed by Anna Hazare were also indicted in the P. B.

The commission also concluded that the maintenance of accounts of the ''Bhrashtachar Virodhi Janandolan Trust'' after 10 November 2001 had not been according to the rules and {{INRConvert|46374||−1}} spent by the ''Sant Yadavbaba Shikshan Prasarak Mandal Trust'' for renovating a temple thwarted its object of imparting secular education.&lt;ref name=&quot;india today&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Justice Sawant Report&quot;/&gt;

===Right to Information movement===
In the early 2000s Hazare led a movement in Maharashtra state which forced the state government to enact a revised Maharashtra Right to Information Act. This Act was later considered as the base document for the [[Right to Information Act|Right to Information Act 2005 (RTI)]], enacted by the Union Government. It also ensured that the President of India assented to this new Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSaXTqOv6rAC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Anna+Hazare+RTI+movement&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HUOdTc_vH8XPrQeF_v2jAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Anna%20Hazare%20RTI%20movement&amp;f=false|title=The Right to Know: Transparency for an Open World|page=24|last=Florini|first=Ann|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14158-1|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2006 the Union Cabinet amended the Right to Information Act 2005 to exclude the file noting by the government officials from its purview. Hazare began his [[fast unto death]] on 9 August 2006 in [[Alandi]] against the proposed amendment. He ended his fast on 19 August 2006, after the government agreed to change its earlier decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-08-19/india/27813455_1_rti-amendment-anna-hazare-anti-corruption-crusader|title=Anna Hazare calls off fast on RTI amendment|newspaper=The Times of India|date=19 August 2006|accessdate=11 April 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of Transfers and Prevention of Delay in Discharge of Official Duties Act===
Before 2006 in the state of Maharashtra, honest government officers were transferred to other places according to ministerial wish, while some corrupt and favoured officials stayed put for decades. Anna fought hard for a law whereby a government servant must clear a file within a specified time and that transfers must take place only after three years. After many years of Anna's relentless efforts, on 25 May 2006 Maharashtra issued a notification announcing the Prevention of Delay in Discharge of Official Duties Act 2006. This act provided for disciplinary action against officials who move files slowly and enabled monitoring of officials who overstay a post, and for involvement in a corrupt nexus.

This act mandated the government to effect transfers of all government officers and employees, except Class IV workers, no sooner and no later than three years, except in emergency or exceptional circumstances. Maharashtra was the first state to have introduced such an act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anna Hazare, our one, big hope, and why he can do it&quot;/&gt; However, like others, this law was not fully followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Practise existing laws first: Anna Hazare&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/tabloid-news/mumbai/Practise-existing-laws-first-Anna-Hazare/Article1-662898.aspx|title=Practise existing laws first: Anna Hazare|last=Chavan|first=Prajakta|date=16 February 2011|publisher=The Hindustan Times|accessdate=9 June 2011|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;State all set to scrap MAT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-29/mumbai/28314355_1_transfer-orders-tribunals-official-duties-act|title=State all set to scrap MAT|last=Marpakwar|first=Prafulla|date=29 July 2010|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=9 June 2011|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Maharashtra rolled out a grain-based liquor policy aimed to encourage production of liquor from food grain in light of the rising demand for spirits—used for industrial purposes and liquor. It issued 36 licenses for distilleries for making alcohol from food grains.&lt;ref name=&quot;मद्यनिर्मितीला प्रोत्साहन देणारे धोरण घटनाबाह्य&quot;/&gt;

Anna Hazare opposed the government's policy to promote making liquor from food grains.

{{Main article|2011 Indian anti-corruption movement}}

In 2011, Hazare participated in the [[satyagraha]] movement campaigning for the passing a stronger anti-corruption ''Lokpal'' ([[ombudsman]]) bill in the Indian parliament. Known as the [[Jan Lokpal Bill]] (People's Ombudsman Bill), this had been drafted by [[N. Santosh Hegde]], a former justice of the [[Supreme Court of India]] and [[Lokayukta]] of [[Karnataka]], [[Prashant Bhushan]]  and [[Arvind Kejriwal]] a social activist. The draft incorporated more stringent provisions and gave wider power to the ''Lokpal'' than the government's 2010 draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/29/stories/2011032963791300.htm|title=Anna Hazare faults Lokpal Bill|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=29 March 2011|last=Deshpande|first=Vinaya|accessdate=5 April 2011|location=Chennai, India|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426200654/http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/29/stories/2011032963791300.htm|archivedate=26 April 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included placing &quot;the Prime Minister within the ambit of the proposed lokpal's powers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pace&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Anna sets pace for faltering govt|date=20 August 2011|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/rssfeed/NewDelhi/Anna-sets-pace-for-faltering-govt/Article1-735238.aspx|work=Hindustan Times|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Draft bill====
During the meeting of the joint drafting committee on 30 May 2011, the Union government members opposed the inclusion of the prime minister, higher judiciary and the acts of the [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] under the purview of the JanLokpal in the draft bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.thehindu.com/news/national/article2062166.ece/|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|title=Contentious issues bog down Lokpal Bill panel|date=30 May 2011|last=Balchand|first=K.|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May, Mukherjee sent a letter to the chief ministers of all [[States and union territories of India|states]] and party leaders seeking their opinion on six contentious issues, including whether to bring the prime minister and judges of India's Supreme Court and High Courts under the law's purview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-01/india/29608301_1_lokpal-bill-lokpal-and-lokayukta-chief-ministers|title=Centre ropes in states, parties on PM question|newspaper=The Times of India|date=1 June 2011|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the civil society members of the drafting committee considered that keeping them out would be a violation of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Keeping-PM-out-of-Lokpal-breach-of-UN-law-Team-Anna/Article1-705442.aspx|title=Keeping PM out of Lokpal breach of UN law: Team Anna|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=4 June 2011|last=Sharma|first=Nagendar|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazare and other civil society members decided to boycott 6 June 2011 drafting committee meeting to protest the forcible eviction of [[Swami Ramdev]] and his followers by the [[Department of Police, Delhi|Delhi Police]] from [[Ramlila Maidan]] on 5 June 2011, while they were on a hunger strike against black money and corruption and doubting the government's seriousness.&lt;ref&gt;

==Controversies and criticism==

===Alleged link with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh===

===Acting as proxy for political parties===
India's ''[[OPEN (Indian magazine)|OPEN Magazine]]'' editorialized that it was &quot;Nonsense&quot; to say Hazare's anti-corruption movement of 2011-12 was apolitical.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nonsense&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/nation/nonsense | title=Nonsense | work=OPEN Magazine | date=October 12, 2011 | accessdate=June 11, 2016 | author=[[Hartosh Singh Bal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The op-ed went on to say that the purpose of the movement was that so long as the Congress Party was kept out of power corrupt politicians of any other party could be elected to Parliament. The example of [[Ajay Chautala]] (now convicted for corruption) was cited as &quot;''In effect, Anna and his team are campaigning for Ajay Chautala effectively the first candidate put up for election by the [[India Against Corruption]] movement''&quot;.

===Views on Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar===
In a press conference in April 2011, Hazare praised [[Narendra Modi]], the chief minister of [[Gujarat]] and [[Nitish Kumar]], chief minister of [[Bihar]] for their efforts on rural development, saying that other chief ministers should emulate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anna Hazare praises Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar; asks CMs to emulate them|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_anna-hazare-praises-narendra-modi-nitish-kumar-asks-cms-to-emulate-them_1530483|date=10 April 2011|accessdate=27 May 2011|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis|DNA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Modi wrote an open letter to him, hailing him as a [[Gandhian]] anti-corruption activist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/narendra-modis-open-letter-to-anna-hazare/148924-53.html|title=Narendra Modi writes an open letter to Anna|date=12 April 2011|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Digvijay Singh criticised him for his comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digvijay singh slams Anna for modi's praise|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/story/modi-remark-congress-slams-anna-hazare/1/135497.html|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, during his visit to Gujarat, Hazare changed his view and criticised Modi for rampant corruption.

=== Accusations of corruption ===
The government of the state of Maharashtra instituted a Commission of Inquiry under Justice PB Sawant in September 2003 to enquire into allegations of corruption against several people, including four ministers in the state as well as the &quot;Hind Swaraj Trust&quot; headed by Hazare. The Commission submitted its report on 22 February 2005, indicting the Trust for corruptly spending Rs. 220,000 on Hazare's birthday celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Had held Hazare guilty of corruption: PB Sawant|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/had-held-hazare-guilty-of-corruption-pb-sawant/175659-37-64.html|date=14 August 2011|accessdate=17 August 2011|newspaper=[[IBNLive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days ahead of Hazare's Lokpal fast, the Indian National Congress, attacked him, alleging that &quot;the moral core of Hazare has been ripped apart&quot; by the Justice P B Sawant Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anna Hazare himself involved in corruption, says Congress|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-08-14/news/29886595_1_hind-swaraj-trust-anna-hazare-lokpal-bill|date=14 August 2011|accessdate=17 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazare's lawyer Milind Pawar responded that the commission had remarked about &quot;irregularities&quot; in the accounts, but had not held him guilty of any &quot;corrupt&quot; practices. Pawar said that on 16 June 1998, a celebration was organised to congratulate Hazare on winning an award from a US–based NGO and it coincided with his 61st birthday. The trust spent Rs 218,000 for the function. Abhay Phirodia, a Pune-based industrialist, who took the initiative to organise this function donated an amount of Rs {{formatnum:248950}} to the trust by cheque soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sawant Commission didn't term Hazare corrupt: Lawyer|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sawant-commission-didnt-term-hazare-corrupt-lawyer/832118/|date=15 August 2011|accessdate=17 August 2011|newspaper=[[Indian Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazare dared the government to file a [[First Information Report]] (FIR) against him to prove the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Angry Anna dares govt to file FIR and prove he is corrupt|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_anna-hazare-dares-congress-to-prove-corruption-charges-against-him_1575981|date=14 August 2011|accessdate=17 August 2011|newspaper=[[Daily News &amp; Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusation of being anti-democratic and anti-Dalit===
An article written in [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|Kolkata Telegraph]] by [[Ramchandra Guha]] stated that environmental journalist Mukul Sharma claimed that Hazare forced the Dalit families in Ralegan Siddhi to adopt a vegetarian diet, and that those who violated the decree were tied to a post and flogged.&lt;ref name=&quot;'A Patriarch for Nation?'&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='A Patriarch for Nation?'|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110827/jsp/opinion/story_14423092.jsp|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=21 August 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mukul Sharma also found that no panchayat elections have been held in the village for the past two decades, and that no campaigning was allowed during state and national elections, upon Hazare's instructions.&lt;ref name=&quot;'A Patriarch for Nation?'&quot;/&gt;

[[Dalit]] columnist [[Chandrabhan Prasad]] opined that Hazare's anti-corruption movement rejected representative democracy and alleged that it was an upper-caste uprising. He also claimed that centralising powers in Lokapal, which was a non-elected entity, was anti-democratic.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Dalit activist [[Kancha Ilaiah]] commented in a similar fashion, that &quot;The Anna movement is an anti-social justice, manuvadi movement. The Dalits, tribals, OBCs and minorities have nothing to do with it. We oppose it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Anna Hazare's movement is anti-social justice, manuwadi'|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-19/india/29904753_1_dalit-d-shyam-babu-anna-hazare|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=21 August 2011|newspaper=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist Anoop Kheri claimed that &quot;The language, symbols used by the movement clearly reflects its upper caste [[Hindu]] nature, a very rightwing Hindu patriotism is being used to get the entire country against corruption. And as a dalit, I have a problem with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt;

There was also an allegation that an RTI activist was denied permission to protest by having a fast-unto-death at [[Ralegan Siddhi]], the grama sabha stating that the reason was that only Hazare can hold such fasts in his village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Here is why RTI activist could not fast in Anna Hazare's village'|url=http://www.punemirror.in/article/2/2010101220101012233239336854a4d16/Here-is-why-RTI-activist-could-not-fast-in-Anna-Hazare%92s-village.html|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=21 August 2011|newspaper=[[Pune Mirror]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activist [[Udit Raj]] was denied permission to protest against Hazare, whom he claimed was against parliamentary processes.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Raj warned that succumbing to Hazare's demands would set a dangerous trend rendering the &quot;backward&quot; classes more vulnerable. He claimed that mass mobilisations coerced the government into a &quot;set of solutions&quot; against constitutional processes could be used against [[affirmative action]] and threatened democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Dalits come out against Anna Hazare's fast'|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-24/india/29921916_1_dalit-intellectuals-caste-system-hazare|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=24 August 2011|newspaper=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it came to light that poor dalits had been paid up to {{INR}}200 each to shout slogans against Hazare, although the organizers denied it. Some protesters said that they had been told that it was a pro-Anna protest, but felt cheated after realising that it was against Hazare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/Print/737720.aspx Protesters 'bought' for anti-Anna agitation] {{wayback|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/Print/737720.aspx |date=20131105010047 |df=y }}.

===Accusation of being anti-Muslim===
On 22 August 2011 writer-actor [[Arundhati Roy]] accused Hazare in a newspaper article of being nonsecular. She questioned his secular credentials, pointing out his &quot;support for [[Raj Thackeray]]'s [[Marathi Manoos]] [[xenophobia]] and [has praised] the 'development model' of Gujarat's CM who oversaw the [[2002 Gujarat riots|2002 pogrom]] against [[Muslim]]s&quot;. The website of the newspaper published many responses to her article and these were mostly critical of her views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-23/india/29918322_1_anna-hazare-arundhati-roy-secular-credentials Anna Hazare is not secular: Arundhati Roy]. ''[[Times of India]]''. (23 August 2011). Retrieved 29 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Activist [[Medha Patkar]] criticised Roy, saying that her views were misplaced.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, Vishwajoy (22 August 2011).

Hazare in the past stood in firm opposition to the [[Shiv Sena]] and BJP governments in Maharashtra. Activist and writer [[Asghar Ali Engineer]] in an EPW article on [[Communalism]] and Communal Violence reported,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engineer|first=Asghar Ali|title=Communalism and Communal Violence, 1996|journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]]|volume=32|issue=7|date=15 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=The Shiv Sena is also facing serious problems from the social activist Anna Hazare who has accused its ministers of corruption and demanded their resignation. The SS-BJP government is facing serious corruption charges and is greatly worried. The Anna Hazare movement began in late November when he went on fast against the corrupt practices of the Shiv Sena ministers. The BJP initially supported the Hazare movement and now its deputy chief minister Gopinath Munde is also under a cloud. Initially the Hazare movement had created a rift between the Shiv Sena and the BJP but with Gopinath Munde himself under a cloud, both may close ranks. The Hazare movement has certainly posed a great challenge for the saffron government at the end of 1996.}}

Hazare was accused of working at the behest of RSS and BJP, and against Muslims by cleric [[Syed Ahmed Bukhari|Bukhari]] of the [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]]. Bhukhari was subsequently criticised for being a Royal Imam and for claiming that his personal views represented the view of ordinary Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/anti-anna-cleric-bukhari-draws-flak_727746.html Anti-Anna cleric Bukhari draws flak].

== Conspiracy to murder Hazare ==
Hazare exposed corruption in cooperative sugar factories in Maharashtra, including one controlled by [[Padamsinh Bajirao Patil|Dr.Padamsinh Bajirao Patil]], a member of Parliament of 15th [[Lok Sabha]] and higher-ranking Leader of [[Nationalist Congress Party]] from [[Osmanabad]].

The conspiracy to kill Hazare was exposed when Parasmal Jain, an accused in the Nimbalkar murder case, in his written confession before a magistrate said that Patil had paid him {{INRConvert|3000000||−1}} to murder Nimbalkar, and also offered him supari (contract killing sum) to kill Anna Hazare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plot to kill Anna Hazare revealed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sify.com/news/plot-to-kill-anna-hazare-revealed-news-features-jgbuanbdjhb.html|title=Plot to kill Anna Hazare revealed|date=1 June 2009|publisher=Sifi News|accessdate=12 June 2011|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plot to kill Magsaysay winner Anna Hazare revealed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/plot-to-kill-magsaysay-winner-anna-hazare-revealed/93908-3.html?from=rssfeed|title=Plot to kill Magsaysay winner Anna Hazare revealed|last=IANS|date=1 June 2009|publisher=IBM Live|accessdate=12 June 2011|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this written confession, Hazare appealed to the state government of Maharashtra to lodge a separate [[First Information Report|First Information Report ( FIR )]] against Patil but the government declined.
