'''Party Order and Justice''' ({{lang-lt|Partija tvarka ir teisingumas}}, PTT), formerly the '''Liberal Democratic Party''' (''Liberalų Demokratų Partija'', LDP), is a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[national liberalism|national liberal]] political party in [[Lithuania]], though it self-identifies as 'left-of-centre'. It has eleven members of the [[Seimas]], the [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Lithuania]]n parliament.

Formed as the 'Liberal Democratic Party' in 2002, the party achieved almost immediate success with the election of leader [[Rolandas Paksas]] as [[President of Lithuania]] within its first year.  Paksas's [[impeachment]] led to the party reorganising itself as 'Order and Justice' to compete in the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2004|2004 parliamentary election]].  Since then, it has been the fourth-largest party in the Seimas, and finished third in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Lithuania)|elections to the European Parliament]] and [[Lithuanian presidential election, 2009|to the presidency]].

The party sits on the right, possesses a [[radical right|radical]] and [[anti-establishment]] identity, and is described as both [[social conservatism|socially conservative]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Mindaugas Jurkynas&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jurkynas |first=Mindaugas |date=June 2009 |title=The parliamentary election in Lithuania, October 2008 |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=329–33 |doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2009.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '[[liberalism|liberal]]', in line with its original identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krupavicius |first=Algis |date=December 2006 |title=Lithuania |journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]] |volume=45 |issue=7–8 |pages=1166–81 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00673.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its support is strongest in the north-west [[Samogitia]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mindaugas Jurkynas&quot; /&gt; The party's two MEPs sit in the  [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]] group in the [[European Parliament]], with the party having previously belonged to the now-defunct [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] (UEN) and [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] (EFD) groups.

==History==

===Early years===
After being defeated in the leadership election for the [[Liberal Union of Lithuania|Liberal Union]], [[Rolandas Paksas]] founded the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 2002, taking with him 13 of his supporters in the Seimas, making the party the fourth-largest party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2003&quot; /&gt;  Paksas finished second in the first round of the [[Lithuanian presidential election, 2002–2003|presidential election]] on 22 December, with 19.7%: qualifying him for a run-off against [[incumbent]] [[President of Lithuania|President]] [[Valdas Adamkus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2003&quot; /&gt;  For the run-off, Paksas represented a youthful alternative to the ageing candidate, adopting the slogan 'Vote for Change';&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krupavicius |first=Algis |date=December 2004 |title=Lithuania |journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]] |volume=43 |issue=7–8 |pages=1059–69 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.2004.00201.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite all the parties except the LDP backing Adamkus, he won across almost all of the country, with 54.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2003&quot; /&gt;  The campaign was likened to the previous spring's [[French presidential election, 2002|French presidential election]], and Paksas to [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] for his [[populism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2003&quot; /&gt;  However, unlike Le Pen, the liberal Paksas immediately announced his support for Lithuania's ongoing process of accession to the [[European Union]] and [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2003&quot; /&gt;

In June, Paksas set about fighting [[political corruption]] that saw 700 public officials under the old administration acquire land illegally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2004&quot; /&gt;  However, this was soon overshadowed by revelations in October that Paksas gave [[citizenship]] to, and heard requests for political favours from, [[Jurijus Borisovas]], a [[Russia]]n businessman that had donated $400,000 to Paksas's campaign, and that high-ranking members of Paksas's staff had connections to Russian criminal groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2004&quot; /&gt;  Although Paksas was found not to have been influenced by the criminals, his staff had been; Paksas offered that his six close advisers named in the report resign, but calls for Paksas himself to resign mounted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2004&quot; /&gt;

Paksas alleged that the parliamentary commission set up to investigate the claims was set up for political reasons, and refused to cooperate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2004&quot; /&gt;  In response, the four other parties initiated [[impeachment]] proceedings.  In December, the [[Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania|Constitutional Court]] ruled that granting citizenship to Borisovas was illegal and impeachable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2004&quot; /&gt;  Despite this, Paksas remained popular with the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2004&quot; /&gt;  On 6 April 2004, the Seimas voted to impeach him and remove him from office on three counts with 86, 86, and 89 MPs voting to impeach, with 85 required.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krupavicius |first=Algis |date=December 2005 |title=Lithuania |journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]] |volume=44 |issue=7–8 |pages=1086–101 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.2005.00273.x1.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, after his impeachment, he was tried in the criminal courts, and acquitted on all charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2005&quot; /&gt;

===Recovery===
[[Lithuanian presidential election, 2004|Another presidential election]] was scheduled to elect a replacement for Paksas.  The LDP nominated Paksas, giving the people a referendum on his impeachment.  Whilst his nomination was initially accepted, it was then thrown out by the Constitutional Court, leaving the LDP without a nominee in the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2005&quot; /&gt;  In the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Lithuania)|first election]] to the [[European Parliament]], the LDP won 6.8% of the vote, and one seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2005&quot; /&gt;  The member of the [[European Parliament]] from the Lithuanian Liberal Democratic party was [[Rolandas Pavilionis]], a former rector of [[Vilnius University]].

Throughout Paksas's scandal and impeachment, the Liberal Democrats presented soft opposition to the governing centre-left coalition, alongside the united [[Liberal and Centre Union]] and [[Homeland Union]].  In the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2004|parliamentary election]] in October, the LDP formed a coalition called ''Coalition for Rolandas Paksas 'For Order and Justice' '', which was successful in winning 11 seats.  However, the centre-left coalition managed to hold on to power, thanks to a failure of the centre-right parties to agree to cooperate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2005&quot; /&gt;

===Renaming===
The last congress of the party, held on 13 May 2006, declared, that the party had passed a difficult stage of its establishment successively, encouraging people of Lithuania to constantly oppose corruption and power misapplication in the country and changing the name of the party to 'Order and Justice'.  The formal reason for changing the name was the fact that four different political groups used the word 'liberal' in their names.  According to unofficial views of some party members, the new name mirrors the party's more conservative position than when it was founded in 2002.

In the [[Lithuanian municipal elections, 2007|2007 municipal elections]], although the party was disappointed with the general results, it won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] in [[Vilnius]], and formed a coalition with the [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania|Social Democratic Party]] (LSDP) under mayor [[Juozas Imbrasas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krupavicius |first=Algis |date=December 2008 |title=Lithuania |journal=[[European Journal of Political Research]] |volume=47 |issue=7–8 |pages=1048–59 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.2008.00800.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is despite Law and Order members of the Seimas then supporting [[motion of no confidence|motions of no confidence]] in several LSDP cabinet members for handling of the [[privatization|privatisation]] of [[Alita (company)|Alita]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Algis Krupavicius 2008&quot; /&gt;

The Order and Justice Party ran in the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 election]] to the Seimas with a tactic of decontaminating Paksas, despite Paksas's inability to hold political office after his impeachment, and released a [[film]] that was shown in cinemas nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mindaugas Jurkynas&quot; /&gt;  Aiming to greatly increase its number of seats and form the new government, the party saw its share of the vote increase only slightly, to 12.7%, and its number of seats increase by 4, to 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mindaugas Jurkynas&quot; /&gt;  The dramatic doubling of the centre-right's share of seats allowed them to form a government: including three parties, but not Order and Justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mindaugas Jurkynas&quot; /&gt;

At the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Lithuania)|2009 European elections]], Order and Justice won two seats, up from one in 2004, coming third.  After the election, they left the disbanding [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] (UEN), and joined the more eurosceptic [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] (EFD).

In May 2012, ahead of the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2012|October 2012 election]], Order and Justice signed a pact with [[Labour Party (Lithuania)|Labour]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Lithuania|Social Democrats]] to cooperate in any post-election negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lithuania's three major opposition parties sign electoral agreement |author= |url=http://www.15min.lt/en/article/politics/lithuania-s-three-major-opposition-parties-sign-electoral-agreement-526-221526 |newspaper=[[15 min]] |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Lithuania)|2014 European election]], Order and Justice MEPs rejoined the EFD group in the European parliament, which was renamed [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]] (EFDD) for the new parliamentary term.
