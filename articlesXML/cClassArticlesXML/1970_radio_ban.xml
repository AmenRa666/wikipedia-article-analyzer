The Australian '''1970 Radio Ban''' or '''1970 Record Ban''' was a &quot;pay for play&quot; dispute in the local music industry that lasted from May till October. During this period, a simmering disagreement between commercial radio stations – represented by Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters (FARB) – and the six largest record labels – represented by [[Australasian Performing Rights Association]] (APRA) – resulted in major United Kingdom and Australian pop songs being refused airplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;2SM&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.milesago.com/radio/2sm.htm | title = Radio – 2SM (Sydney) | work = Milesago: Australasian Music and Popular Culture 1964–1975 | last1 = Kimball | first1 = Duncan | last2 = Kruger | first2 = Debbie | authorlink2 = Debbie Kruger | last3 = Mac | first3 = Wayne | publisher = Ice Productions | date = June 2003 | accessdate = 4 December 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101125024727/http://milesago.com/Radio/2sm.htm| archivedate= 25 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KentDM&quot;&gt;Kent, David Martin. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The government-owned [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] – which had its own copyright and royalty arrangement with recording and music publishing companies – did not take part in the dispute. The ban did not extend to releases by American artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;2SM&quot;/&gt; Some radio disc jockeys, such as [[Stan Rofe]], defied the ban by playing songs according to their personal tastes.&lt;ref name=&quot;2SM&quot;/&gt;

Teen-oriented pop music newspaper ''[[Go-Set]]'' reported on the dispute: it interviewed affected musicians and its journalists argued for the removal of the ban. Once the ban was lifted, ''[[status quo]] ante'' resulted: APRA's record companies returned to supplying free promotional material and FARB's radio stations resumed playing their records.

During the ban some Australian musicians recorded [[cover version|covers]] of UK artists' hits on previously minor labels. [[The Mixtures]], for example, recorded [[Mungo Jerry]]'s &quot;[[In the Summertime (Mungo Jerry song)|In the Summertime]]&quot; on the Fable Label which was released in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;mixtures&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.milesago.com/artists/mixtures.htm | title = The Mixtures | work = Milesago: Australasian Music and Popular Culture 1964–1975 | last1 = Kimball | first1 = Duncan | publisher = Ice Productions | year = 2002 | accessdate = 19 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;1 for nine weeks to be displaced by &quot;[[Yellow River (song)|Yellow River]]&quot; – originally by [[Christie (band)|Christie]] – which was covered by two Australian groups, Jigsaw (from Melbourne) and Autumn (from Sydney). Music charts from the period indicate that in the years immediately following the ban, there was a significant reduction in the number of Australian acts who scored major chart peaks.

==Background==
The 1970 Radio Ban had its origins early in 1969, following the enactment of the new [[Australian copyright law|Copyright Act 1968]], a group of recording companies – including most of the members of the [[Australasian Performing Rights Association]] (APRA) –  decided to scrap a long-standing royalty agreement with commercial radio stations that dated back to the 1950s. The recording companies included five major overseas labels [[Polygram]], [[EMI]], [[RCA Records|RCA]], [[CBS]] and [[Warner Music Group|Warner]] and Australia's leading local company, [[Festival Records|Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KentDM&quot;/&gt;

APRA and the record labels demanded payment of a new levy for pop records played on commercial radio, claiming that they were providing free programming for radio stations, which had traditionally been supplied with free promotional copies of new records. The commercial radio lobby – represented by the Federation of Radio Broadcasters (FARB) – baulked at the proposed levy, arguing that they provided a large amount of free promotion for the records they played.&lt;ref name=&quot;2SM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KentDM&quot;/&gt; The government-owned [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] – which had its own copyright and royalty arrangement with recording and music publishing companies – did not take part in the dispute.

In April 1970, teen-oriented pop music newspaper ''[[Go-Set]]'' reported on the dispute and interviewed musicians including former King of Pop [[Normie Rowe]], who feared &quot;it could be a major blow to the Australian scene&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowe&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = The Record Ban | newspaper = [[Go-Set]] | publisher = Waverley Press | date = 18 April 1970 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other musicians expected the situation would be resolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowe&quot;/&gt; Radio disc jockey and ''Go-Set'' columnist [[Stan Rofe]] claimed discussions were progressing and the threat of a ban was over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rofe&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = The Tonic | last1  = Rofe | first1 = Stan | authorlink1 = Stan Rofe | newspaper = Go-Set | publisher = Waverley Press | date = 25 April 1970 | page = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow columnist and compiler of the ''Go-Set'' National Top&amp;nbsp;40, [[Ed Nimmervoll]], predicted that its charts would be compromised as local artists' record sales were dependent on radio play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nimmervoll2504&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Save the Top&amp;nbsp;40! | last1 = Nimmervoll | first1 = Ed | authorlink1 = Ed Nimmervoll | newspaper = Go-Set | publisher = Waverley Press | date = 25 April 1970 | page = 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After negotiations between the parties broke down, in late May 1970, the recording companies imposed a six-month embargo on the supply of previously free promotional records to radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;mixtures&quot; /&gt; In retaliation, FARB members boycotted all new major label releases by UK or Australian artists – but not by American artists – and refused to include records from these companies in their weekly chart surveys.&lt;ref name=&quot;2SM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mixtures&quot; /&gt; This was a serious matter as there was only one Australian national pop chart – published by ''Go-Set'' – and most Top&amp;nbsp;40 charts were collated locally by individual radio stations in major cities and towns.&lt;ref name=&quot;KentDM&quot;/&gt; [[Darryl Cotton]], lead singer of pop group [[Zoot (band)|Zoot]] was concerned that the public would be unaware of new releases by local acts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meldrum&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Pop Speak Out | last1  = Meldrum | first1 = Ian &quot;Molly&quot; | authorlink1 = Ian Meldrum | newspaper = Go-Set | publisher = Waverley Press | date = 25 May 1970 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solo singer [[Ronnie Burns (singer)|Ronnie Burns]] believed it would affect groups more than individuals, who had greater access to television shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meldrum&quot;/&gt; Another singer, [[Russell Morris]], criticised the policy which led to the ban, &quot;[the Government] didn't realise that the pop recording market is a very large and important industry&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meldrum&quot;/&gt; As from 30 May, Nimmervoll's charts in ''Go-Set'' were based on direct surveying of large record-selling stores instead of relying on radio stations' Top&amp;nbsp;40s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nimmervoll3005&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = ''Go-Set'' National Top&amp;nbsp;40 | last1 = Nimmervoll | first1 = Ed | newspaper = Go-Set | publisher = Waverley Press | date = 30 May 1970 | page = 26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban did not extend to American artists on the same labels as UK or Australian artists. Some disc jockeys, including Rofe, defied the ban on their radio shows – he regularly played &quot;Turn Up Your Radio&quot; by [[The Masters Apprentices]] which had been issued by EMI in April. Rofe also championed the cause of Australian musicians in ''Go-Set'' by criticising mainstream media coverage of the dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;2SM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KentDM&quot;/&gt;

During the ban, many UK hits like [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[The Long and Winding Road]]&quot; and [[Mary Hopkin]]'s &quot;[[Knock, Knock Who's There?]]&quot; gained only limited exposure in Australia. Some local artists released cover versions of UK hits; Melbourne singer [[Liv Maessen]]'s &quot;Knock, Knock, Who's There&quot; debuted in the Top&amp;nbsp;10 in May with co-credit to Hopkin and Maessen.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoSetKnock&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1970/19700530.html | last1 = Nimmervoll | first1 = Ed | newspaper = Go-Set | title = ''Go-Set'' National Top&amp;nbsp;40 with Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = Waverley Press | date = 30 May 1970 | accessdate = 28 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;2 in early August and earned Maessen the first gold record ever awarded to an Australian female artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milesago.com/Artists/maessen.htm|title=Liv Maessen|publisher=Milesago|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[In the Summertime (Mungo Jerry song)|In the Summertime]]&quot; by [[The Mixtures]] was a cover of [[Mungo Jerry]]'s hit which reached No.&amp;nbsp;1 in August for nine weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoSetSummer&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1970/19700829.html | last1 = Nimmervoll | first1 = Ed | newspaper = Go-Set | title = ''Go-Set'' National Top&amp;nbsp;40 with Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = Waverley Press | date = 29 August 1970 | accessdate = 21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melbourne band Jigsaw and Sydney band Autumn both had success with their respective versions of [[Christie (band)|Christie's]] hit song, &quot;[[Yellow River (song)|Yellow River]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/71/autumn/yellow-river|title=Yellow River - Autumn|publisher=PopArchives.com.au|accessdate=19 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100326043913/http://www.poparchives.com.au/71/autumn/yellow-river| archivedate= 26 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Yellow River&quot; displaced &quot;In the Summertime&quot; at No.&amp;nbsp;1 in late October.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoSetYellow&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1970/19701031.html | last1 = Nimmervoll | first1 = Ed | newspaper = Go-Set | title = ''Go-Set'' National Top&amp;nbsp;40 with Ed Nimmervoll | publisher = Waverley Press | date = 31 October 1970 | accessdate = 21 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period, the ban had the inadvertent effect of putting more local musicians to air than ever before, and also opened the door to the 'underground' artists on previously minor labels such as Fable Label.&lt;ref name=&quot;KentDM&quot;/&gt;

Music charts in the years immediately following the ban show there was a significant reduction in the number of Australian acts who scored major chart peaks. The ''Go-Set'' charts for 1972, for example, indicate that only two Australian acts ([[Colleen Hewett]] and [[Blackfeather]]) had national No.&amp;nbsp;1 hits;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1972/1972.html|title=Go Set charts 1972|publisher=PopArchives.com.au|accessdate=19 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100428064014/http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1972/1972.html| archivedate= 28 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1973 no Australian act scored a No.&amp;nbsp;1 hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1973/1973.html|title=Go Set charts 1973|publisher=PopArchives.com.au|accessdate=19 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100329040328/http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/1973/1973.html| archivedate= 29 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
