'''9Go!''' is an Australian [[free-to-air]] digital television multichannel, which was launched by the [[Nine Network]] on 9 August 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;august-launch-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Nine announces new TV channel|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/837881/nine-announces-new-tv-channel|publisher=[[ninemsn]]|date=15 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;launch schedule&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Nine releases GO! schedule|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/07/nine-releases-go-schedule.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a youthful channel that offers a mix of comedy, reality, general entertainment, movies, animation and drama aimed at people between the ages of 16 to 39, as well as kids.&lt;ref name=&quot;2015 Survey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/06/multichannel-survey-go-gem-3.html|title=Multichannel Survey: GO! / GEM|last=Knox|first=David|publisher=TV Tonight|date=17 June 2015|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins and launch===
The general concept for GO! was revealed on 23 March 2009, with the [[Nine Network]] announcing their intention to start a [[standard definition]] variety-based multichannel, launched midway through 2009. The channel's name and branding was first revealed as '''GO!99''' on 14 April 2009 by TV Tonight, a blog dedicated to [[Television in Australia|Australian television]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GO!99&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=GO!99 for entertainment?|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/04/go99-for-entertainment.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=14 April 2009|accessdate= 29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel's final name was confirmed by the Nine Network via ''[[A Current Affair]]'' as '''GO!''' on 15 July 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;GO! confirmation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Nine confirms GO!99|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/07/nine-confirms-go99.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=15 July 2009|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as multi-coloured logo variations.&lt;ref name=&quot;august-launch-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GO! confirmation&quot;/&gt;

The channel went to air at {{nowrap|1:00 pm}} on 5 August 2009, broadcasting a promo loop. GO! officially began broadcasting scheduled programming from 9 August 2009 at {{nowrap|6:30 pm}} with a 1-minute promo featuring the song &quot;Go!&quot; by [[Sydney]] based sound house group Noise International featuring vocals by [[Sister2Sister|Sharon Muscat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Channel GO! promo song |url=http://www.tvauscast.com/2009/11/03/channel-go-promo-song/ |publisher=tvauscast.com |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=24 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926130658/http://www.tvauscast.com/2009/11/03/channel-go-promo-song/ |archivedate=26 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then followed by an episode of ''[[Wipeout (2008 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]]'', the first programme to air on the new channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Go Adjusts Launch Time|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/07/go-adjusts-launch-time.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=29 July 2009|accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nine Network's regional affiliates, [[WIN Television]] and [[NBN Television]], also launched GO! on 9 August 2009, on channel 88.

Darwin received the channel in October 2010 (over a year after other capital cities started transmitting the multi channel). From December 2010, Nine Network affiliate [[Imparja Television]] commenced transmission of the GO! channel to viewers in remote areas of Central, Northern and Eastern Australia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imparja.com/images/stories/switchons/imparja%5C%27s%20plans%20for%20digital%20broadcasting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
before expanding to Eastern South Australia on 11 November 2011.

There have been reports that GO!'s technical launch had caused a significant number of digital TV receivers to no longer pick up Nine's digital channels. Nine have established a helpline for viewers experiencing problems or requiring assistance to tune in to the new channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Asher|last=Moses|title=Nine flicks the Go! switch and everything fades to black|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/hometech/nine-flicks-the-go-switch-and-everything-fades-to-black-20090807-echr.html|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=7 August 2009|accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–2014===
The theme song, &quot;Go&quot; by Noise International featuring Sharon Muscat was later released on iTunes in the same year that it launched (2009). A music video for the song was shown on GO! after programs featuring Sharon Muscat performing the song with a dancing crowd.

GO! celebrated its first birthday in 2010 by playing movies every night at 10pm during the month of August 2010. GO! also played a mini clip during the commercial breaks thanking everyone for watching GO!

GO! introduced Newsbursts, a news-break filler program in 2010. These would usually feature a breaking news story and the weather. These were later dropped in 2011, replaced by repeats of Nine's Newsbreak.

GO! received a new on-air presentation for 2011. GO! also played a mini clip after programs during Summer 2010/2011, featuring the song &quot;Hello&quot; by The Potbelleez, saying that 2011 was going to be a great year for GO! with the slogan &quot;Let's GO! 2011&quot;. This presentation remained unchanged for the next few years (Except for the lineup, which was updated in 2013 but not the rest).

On 27 January 2014, GO! stopped using the Supertext logo and switched to Nine's Closed Captioning logo.

===2014–2016: rebrand and refocus===
On 2 February 2014, GO! received a new logo, new on-air presentation graphics updated by creative company DD8, a new demographic, and a revamped lineup, with Kids WB having a Weekday version.

The channel was also changed to a Youth-organised channel, with most of the daytime lineup having Kids programming, and most of the nighttime programming being Movies and Youth-Adult programming.

On 26 November 2015, the Nine Network introduced a network-wide rebrand of all of its digital channels with GO! being renamed '''9Go!'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebrand2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Nine Upfronts 2016: Nine goes HD, new lifestyle channel - and Daryl Somers returns|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/10/nine-upfronts-2016-nine-goes-hd-new-lifestyle-channel-and-daryl-somers-returns.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=28 October 2015|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 9Go! was moved to channel 93, but a simulcast currently remains available on channel 99.&lt;ref name=&quot;9Gembumped&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Reilly|last=Claire|title=Nine Network to live stream all channels and revamp HD|url=http://www.cnet.com/au/news/nine-network-to-live-stream-all-channels-and-revamp-hd/|publisher=cnet.com.au|date=29 October 2015|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, 9Go!'s on-air theme was changed for a continuous design across all of its channels. This included a new look for program listings, program advertisements and promos.

===2016–present: regional media shakeup and beyond===
Nine announced that it had signed a new affiliation deal with Southern Cross Austereo on 29 April 2016, replacing WIN Television as the primary Nine affiliate starting 1 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/nine-and-southern-cross-in-multiyear-affiliation-deal-20160428-goha3w.html |title=Nine and Southern Cross in multi-year affiliation deal |last=White |first=Dominic |date=29 April 2016 |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, 9Go! will be broadcast by Southern Cross into Regional Queensland, Southern NSW/ACT, Regional Victoria and Spencer Gulf SA/Broken Hill NSW on channel 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scaengage.com.au/news-events/sca-affiliation-agreement-with-nine-entertainment-co-faq/ |title=SCA Affiliation Agreement with Nine Entertainment Co., FAQ |date=5 May 2016 |publisher=Southern Cross Austereo |access-date=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nineon5.com.au/#!faq/cee5 |title=Nine On 5 FAQ |date=12 June 2016 |publisher=Southern Cross Austereo |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Original plans for GO! suggested it would consist of a mix of entertainment and lifestyle programming (this rule wasn't featured until the launch of future Female-oriented HD channel [[GEM (Australian TV channel)|GEM]] in 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;plans-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Lara |last=Sinclair |title=David Gyngell confirms plans for digital |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,25225781-7582,00.html |publisher=''[[The Australian]]'' |date=23 March 2009 |accessdate=30 June 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;plans-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Nine to launch 'entertainment channel'|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/03/nine-to-launch-entertainment-channel.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=23 March 2009|accessdate=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this branding was replaced by a youth-orientated light-entertainment channel instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;youth-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Nine introduces youth channel: Go!|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/06/nine-plans-youth-channel.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=20 June 2009|accessdate=28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; GO!'s programming is generally structured under nightly themed blocks,&lt;ref name=&quot;more details&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=More details ready to Go!|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/07/more-details-ready-to-go.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=23 July 2009|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of comedy on Sunday, all new reality shows on Tuesday, sci-fi on Wednesday,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} female-skewed drama on Thursday (until the launch of GEM, when it was replaced by Movies themings instead), and movies on Friday.&lt;ref name=&quot;more details&quot;/&gt; Movies screen with &quot;limited and brief commercial breaks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;all systems&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=October 4th: All systems Go!|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/09/october-4th-all-systems-go.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=5 September 2009|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schedule is designed not to cannibalise viewers from the main Nine channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;survivors ready&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Survivors ready?

It was announced in June 2009 that the Nine Network had signed a $500 million deal with [[Warner Bros.]] to continue its current output deal for another five years from 2011 to 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;warner deal-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Warner deal helps build GO! for Nine|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/06/warner-deal-helps-build-new-channel-for-nine.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warner deal-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Guider|author2=Bulbeck, Pip|title=Nine, Warners renew pact|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i34e2ede5adb7e1e8296422da12a6533c|publisher=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''|date=21 June 2009|accessdate=28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal helped Nine retain existing content (including many television series and films), as well as providing new content for both its primary channel, GEM (launched in 2010) and Go!.&lt;ref name=&quot;warner deal-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warner deal-2&quot;/&gt; The network also has ongoing content deals with [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Village Roadshow]],&lt;ref name=&quot;warner deal-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warner deal-2&quot;/&gt; and has secured a new content partnership with [[MTV Networks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;curbwireweeds&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Curb, Wire &amp; Weeds set to GO!|url=http://tvtonight.com.au/2009/09/curb-wire-weeds-set-to-go.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=16 September 2009|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feature classic films broadcast on 9Go! are sourced from its studio-output deals, including [[20th Century Fox]], [[DreamWorks]], [[DreamWorks Animation]], [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lions Gate]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] (old films only).

Leading up to the ad break, GO! airs replays of [[Nine News#Nine Newsbreak|Nine's Newsbreak]] that air on the main Nine channel and from GEM. All newsbreaks are broadcast across any state. The [[National Rugby League|NRL]] is shown on GO! in Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Tasmania on Friday nights when the cricket is scheduled on GEM.

The [[National Basketball League (Australia)|NBL]] was broadcast on GO!, on Sunday if the cricket was scheduled on GEM.

==Logo and identity history==
When GO! was in development stages, the concept name was revealed as '''GO!99''' on 14 April 2009 with a black and white concept logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;GO!99&quot;/&gt; On 15 July 2009, news program ''[[A Current Affair]]'' confirmed the name as '''GO!''' along with a scheme of multi-coloured logos based on the original concept logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;august-launch-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GO! confirmation&quot;/&gt; On 2 February 2014, the channel's branding was refreshed with a new, 3D glossy logo with multi-coloured gradient variants. Following the network-wide rebrand on 26 November 2015, the channel was renamed '''9Go!''' with the famous &quot;nine dots&quot; from Nine's logo integrated into then-current logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;rebrand2015&quot;/&gt; WIN Television has a variant of the GO! logo with the aforementioned channel's logo above GO!'s 2009-2014 logo.
