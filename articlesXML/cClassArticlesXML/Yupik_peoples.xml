The '''Yupik''' are a group of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous or aboriginal]] peoples of western, southwestern, and southcentral [[Alaska]] and the [[Russian Far East]]. They are [[Eskimo]]  and are related to the [[Inuit]] and [[Iñupiat people]]s. Yupik peoples include the following:

* '''[[Alutiiq people]]''', or [[Sugpiaq]], of the [[Alaska Peninsula]] and coastal and island areas of southcentral Alaska
* '''[[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people]]''' of the [[Yukon River|Yukon]]-[[Kuskokwim River|Kuskokwim]] delta, the [[Kuskokwim River]], and along the northern coast of [[Bristol Bay]] as far east as [[Nushagak Bay]] and the northern [[Alaska Peninsula]] at [[Naknek River]] and [[Egegik Bay]] in Alaska

==Population==
The Central Alaskan Yupik are by far the most numerous of the various  [[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]] groups and speak the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language]], a member of the  [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] family of languages.

As of the 2001 U.S. Census, the Yupik population in the [[United States]] numbered over 24,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;censusUS&quot;&gt;U.S. Census Bureau. (2004-06-30).

==Etymology of name==
''Yup'ik'' (plural ''Yupiit'') comes from the Yup'ik word ''yuk'' meaning ''&quot;person&quot;'' plus the post-base ''-pik'' meaning ''&quot;real&quot;'' or ''&quot;genuine.&quot;'' Thus, it means literally &quot;real people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;frboundariesAJ&quot;&gt;Fienup-Riordan, 1993, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnographic literature sometimes refers to the Yup'ik people or their language as ''Yuk'' or ''Yuit''. In the Hooper Bay-Chevak and Nunivak dialects of Yup'ik, both the language and the people are known as ''Cup'ik''.&lt;ref name=&quot;anlc&quot;/&gt;

The use of an apostrophe in the name &quot;Yup’ik&quot;, compared to Siberian &quot;Yupik&quot;, exemplifies the Central Yup’ik’s orthography, where &quot;the apostrophe represents [[gemination]] [or lengthening] of the ‘p’ sound&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Steven A. ''Central Yup’ik and the Schools: A Handbook for Teachers.'' Juneau: Alaska Native Language Center, 1984. page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The common ancestors of the [[Eskimo]] and [[Aleut people|Aleut]] (as well as various [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleo-Siberian]] groups) are believed by [[archaeologists]] to have their origin in eastern [[Siberia]], arriving in the [[Bering Sea]] area about 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Naske and Slotnick, 1987, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[blood types]], confirmed by later [[linguistic]] and [[DNA]] findings, suggests that the ancestors of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] reached [[North America]] before the ancestors of the Eskimo and Aleut.  There appear to have been several waves of migration from Siberia to the Americas by way of the [[Bering land bridge]],&lt;ref&gt;Naske and Slotnick, 1987, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; which became exposed between 20,000 and 8,000 years ago during periods of glaciation. By about 3,000 years ago, the progenitors of the Yupiit had settled along the coastal areas of what would become western Alaska, with migrations up the coastal rivers&amp;mdash;notably the [[Yukon River|Yukon]] and [[Kuskokwim River|Kuskokwim]]&amp;mdash;around 1400 AD, eventually reaching as far upriver as [[Paimiut, Alaska|Paimiut]] on the Yukon and [[Crow Village, Alaska|Crow Village]] on the Kuskokwim.&lt;ref name=&quot;frboundariesAJ&quot;/&gt;

== Culture ==
[[File:Alaska yupik mask.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Yup'ik mask]], [[Sitka, Alaska]], collection of the [[Alaska State Museum]]]]
[[File:Central Yup'ik basket (UBC-2011).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Yup'ik basket.]]
Traditionally, families spent the spring and summer at fish camp, then joined with others at village sites for the winter.  Many families still harvest the traditional subsistence resources, especially [[Pacific salmon]] and [[seal (mammal)|seal]].

The men's communal house, the ''[[qasgiq]]'', was the community center for ceremonies and festivals which included singing, dancing, and [[storytelling]]. The qasgiq was used mainly in the winter months, because people would travel in family groups following food sources throughout the spring, summer, and fall months.  Aside from ceremonies and festivals, it was also where the men taught the young boys survival and hunting skills, as well as other life lessons.  The young boys were also taught how to make tools and [[qayaq]]s ([[kayaks]]) during the winter months in the qasgiq. The ceremonies involve a [[shaman]].
[[Image:Yupik mask Branly 70-1999-1-2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A Yupik [[mask]] or ''kegginaquq'']]
The women's house, the ''ena'', was traditionally right next door. In some areas they were connected by a tunnel.  Women taught the young girls how to tan hides and sew, process and cook game and fish, and weave.  Boys would live with their mothers until they were about five years old, then they would live in the qasgiq.  Each winter, for a period of between three and six weeks, the young boys and young girls would switch, with the men teaching the girls survival and hunting skills and toolmaking, and the women teaching the boys how to sew and cook.

In Yup'ik group [[Yup'ik dancing|dances]], individuals often remain stationary while moving their upper body and arms rhythmically, their gestures accentuated by hand held dance fans, very similar in design to Cherokee dance fans. The limited motion by no means limits the expressiveness of the dances, which can be gracefully flowing, bursting with energy, or wryly humorous.

The Yup'ik are unique among native peoples of the Americas in that they name children after the last person in the community to have died.

The [[kuspuk]] (''qaspeq'') is a traditional Yup'ik garment, worn in both casual and formal settings in Alaska. The [[seal-oil lamp]] ''(naniq)'' was an important piece of furniture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmai.si.edu/searchcollections/results.aspx?objtype=Furnishings+(Home)&amp;objid=Lamp National Museum of the American Indian : Yup'ik (Yupik Eskimo) Lamps]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages ==
{{Main article|Yupik languages}}

The five [[Yupik language]]s (related to [[Inuktitut]]) are still very widely spoken; more than 75% of the Yupik/Yup'ik population are fluent in the language.

The Alaskan and Siberian Yupik, like the Alaskan [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]],adopted the system of writing developed by [[Moravian Church]] missionaries during the 1760s in [[Greenland]].  The Alaskan Yupik and Inupiat are the only Northern indigenous peoples to have developed their own system of [[hieroglyph]]ics, but this system that died with its creators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/inuit/020018-1200-e.html &quot;The Inuktitut Language&quot; in ''Project Naming''], the identification of Inuit portrayed in photographic collections at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Late nineteenth-century Moravian missionaries to the Yupik in southwestern Alaska used Yupik in church services, and translated the scriptures into the people's language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilbuck&quot;&gt;[http://www.jacobsburg.org/jacobsburg_record.html Ballard, Jan. &quot;In the Steps of Gelelemend: John Henry Killbuck&quot;], ''Jacobsburg Record'' (Publication of the Jacobsburg Historical Society, Nazareth, Pennsylvania), Volume 33, Issue 1 (Winter 2006): 4-5, accessed 6 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian explorers in the 1800s erroneously called the Yupik people bordering the territory of the somewhat unrelated [[Aleut people|Aleut]] as also Aleut, or ''[[Alutiiq]],'' in Yupik.  By tradition, this term has remained in use, as well as ''[[Sugpiaq]],'' both of which refer to the Yupik of South Central Alaska and [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]].

The whole [[Eskimo–Aleut language]] family, and also all Alaskan languages are shown below.&lt;ref name=anlc&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090123172349/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/index.html Alaska Native Language Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123172349/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/index.html |date=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here is a wikified version of the mentioned tree (restricted to the [[Eskimo–Aleut]] family):
