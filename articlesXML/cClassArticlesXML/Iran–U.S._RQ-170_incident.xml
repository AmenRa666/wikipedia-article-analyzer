On 4 December 2011, an American [[Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) was captured by Iranian forces near the city of [[Kashmar]] in northeastern [[Iran]]. The Iranian government announced that the UAV was brought down by its [[cyberwarfare]] unit which commandeered the aircraft and safely landed it, after initial reports from Western news sources disputedly claimed that it had been &quot;shot down&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1215/Exclusive-Iran-hijacked-US-drone-says-Iranian-engineer |title=Exclusive: Iran hijacked US drone, says Iranian engineer |first1=Scott |last1=Peterson | first2=Payam |last2=Faramarzi|work=csmonitor.com |year=2011 |accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government initially denied the claims but later [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] acknowledged that the downed aircraft was a US drone and requested that Iran return it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/07/world/meast/iran-drone-video/ |title=Iran claims released footage is from downed U.S. drone |work=[[CNN]] |first=Lateef |last=Mungin |date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/12/world/meast/iran-us-drone/index.html |title=Obama says U.S. has asked Iran to return drone aircraft |work=[[CNN]] |publisher=CNN Wire Staff|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the United States initially claimed that its forces in Afghanistan had lost control of a [[UAV]] on 4 December 2011 and that there was a possibility that this is the vehicle that crashed near Kashmar.  According to unnamed U.S. officials, a U.S. UAV operated by the Central Intelligence Agency was flying on the Afghan side of the Afghanistan-Iran border when its operators lost control of the vehicle.&lt;ref name=bbc8&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran shows film of captured US drone |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16098562 |newspaper=BBC News |date=8 December 2011 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/08/world/meast/iran-drone U.S. officials, analysts differ on whether drone in Iran TV video is real – CNN.com]. Edition.cnn.com. (8 December 2011) Retrieved 12 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been reports that &quot;foreign officials and American experts who have been briefed on the effort&quot; state that the crashed UAV was taking part in routine surveillance of Iranian nuclear facilities inside Iranian airspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drone Crash in Iran Reveals Secret U.S. Surveillance Effort |first1=Scott |last1=Shane |first2=David E |last2=Sanger |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/world/middleeast/drone-crash-in-iran-reveals-secret-us-surveillance-bid.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drone appeared to be largely intact, except for possible minor visible damage on its left wing. Dan Goure, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, stated the largely intact airframe ruled out the possibility of an engine or navigational malfunction: &quot;Either this was a cyber/electronic warfare attack system that brought the system down or it was a glitch in the command-and-control system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2011/12/defense-iran-captured-rq-170-how-bad-120911/ |title=Iran’s captured RQ-170: How bad is the damage? |author=Dave Majumdar |date=9 December 2011 |newspaper=Air Force Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one US source admitted that Iran could have interrupted the data-link and brought it to a soft landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Majumdar|first1=Dave|title=Iranian Copy of U.S. Unmanned Stealth Aircraft is a Fake|url=http://news.usni.org/2014/05/12/iranian-copy-u-s-unamnned-stealth-aircraft-fake|publisher=USNI News|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some US officials stated the drone broke into three pieces during impact. They claimed that it was reassembled for display purposes and was painted by Iran to hide the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4162745,00.html |title=US official: Iran assembled drone like puzzle - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] released a statement acknowledging that it had lost control of a UAV during the previous week, claiming that it was &quot;flying a mission over western Afghanistan&quot; when control was lost. The statement did not specify the model of the aircraft. The U.S. government also stated that it was still investigating the cause of the loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost_downing&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Jaffe|first=Greg|author2=Erdbrink, Thomas|title=Iran says it downed U.S. stealth drone; Pentagon acknowledges aircraft downing|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iran-says-it-downed-us-stealth-drone-pentagon-acknowledges-aircraft-downing/2011/12/04/gIQAyxa8TO_story.html?wprss=rss_national-security|accessdate=5 December 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Christian Science Monitor]] article relates an Iranian engineer's assertion that the drone was captured by jamming both satellite and land-originated control signals to the UAV, followed up by a [[GPS spoofing|GPS spoofing attack]] that fed the UAV false [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] data to make it land in Iran at what the drone thought was its home base in Afghanistan. [[Stephen Trimble]] from [[Flightglobal.com|Flight Global]] assumes UAV guidance could be targeted by [[Avtobaza|1L222 Avtobaza]] radar jamming and deception system supplied to Iran by Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2011/12/avtobaza-irans-weapon-in-rq-17.html Avtobaza: Iran's weapon in alleged RQ-170 affair?]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for [[Nova (TV series)|Nova]], U.S. retired Lt. General [[David Deptula]] also said &quot;There was a problem with the aircraft and it landed in an area it wasn't supposed to land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1215/Exclusive-Iran-hijacked-US-drone-says-Iranian-engineer |title=Exclusive: Iran hijacked US drone, says Iranian engineer|author1=Scott Peterson |author2=Payam Faramarzi|date=15 December 2011|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nova Rise of the Drones&quot;&gt;{{cite av media|title=&quot;Nova - Rise of the Drones&quot;|url=http://video.pbs.org/video/2314355060/|date=23 January 2013|accessdate=24 January 2013|time=&quot;0:37&quot;|people=David A.

American aeronautical engineers dispute this, pointing out that as is the case with the [[MQ-1 Predator]], the [[MQ-9 Reaper]], and the [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk]], &quot;GPS is not the primary navigation sensor for the RQ-170... The vehicle gets its flight path orders from an [[inertial navigation system]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meade |first=Sean |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/defense/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;newspaperUserId=27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3A27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post%3Abca8e6e2-70ef-40a3-8c56-f83aa6fc7ade |title=Ares |publisher=Aviation Week |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inertial navigation continues to be used on military aircraft despite the advent of GPS because GPS signal jamming and spoofing are relatively simple operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviationintel.com/?p=4681 |title=Iran Says It Will Display More Us &amp; Israeli Drones |publisher=aviationintel |date=16 December 2011 |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US acknowledgement==
On 6 December 2011, U.S. officials acknowledged that a drone crashed in or near Iranian airspace and that this belonged to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and not to [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] as was earlier stated. U.S. officials did not state that the drone shown on Iranian television was actually a real RQ-170 (which has been public knowledge since 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/checkpoint-washington/post/after-drone-was-lost-cia-tried-a-head-fake/2011/12/06/gIQAJNrnZO_blog.html|title=After drone was lost, CIA tried a head fake|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=8 December 2011|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a former U.S. official confirmed that the drone shown on the Iranian state media was a U.S. RQ-170, used for surveillance of Tehran's nuclear facilities.

On 5 December 2011, U.S. military sources confirmed that the remains of an RQ-170 had been captured by Iranian forces. Media reports indicated that various U.S. officials declined to confirm whether or not the drone in the video released by Iranian state television was authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/world/middleeast/iran-shows-us-drone-on-tv-and-lodges-a-protest.html |title=Iran Shows Video It Says Is of U.S. Drone |author=Rick Gladstone |date=8 December 2011 |newspaper=the New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December 2011, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the ''Washington Post'' that the U.S. cannot be certain the drone shown was real because the U.S. does not have access to it, but also stated that &quot;We have no indication that it was brought down by hostile fire.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost_downing&quot;/&gt; A second senior U.S. military official said that a major question is how the drone could have remained &quot;virtually intact,&quot; given the high altitude from which it is said to have crashed. [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, told a news conference on 8 December 2011 that Pentagon analysts were examining the video.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_doubts&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/08/world/meast/iran-drone/index.html |title=U.S. officials, analysts differ on whether drone in Iran TV video is real |date=8 December 2011 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kirby and fellow spokesman George Little would not comment further on whether the U.S. military believed the drone was the one missing, both did say that the missing drone had not been recovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_doubts&quot;/&gt; Later that day, CBS reported that the US officials had confirmed in private the authenticity of the drone shown by the Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57339834/u.s-official-iran-does-have-our-drone/ U.S. official: Iran does have our drone]. CBS News (8 December 2011). Retrieved 12 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complaint to UN Security Council==
On 9 December 2011, Iran lodged a formal complaint to the [[United Nations Security Council]] over the UAV violating its airspace. Iran's U.N. ambassador stated in the letter that &quot;My government emphasizes that this blatant and unprovoked air violation by the United States government is tantamount to an act of hostility against the Islamic Republic of Iran in clear contravention of international law, in particular, the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=General: Iran won't return U.S. drone it claims to have |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/world/meast/iran-us-drone/ |accessdate=28 November 2013 |publisher=CNN |date=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Request for return by the United States==
On 12 December 2011, U.S. administration asked Iran to return the captured U.S. drone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Obama appeals to Iran to give back downed US drone |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i5gl4YdDNfAVphvLVmdMcaRn0_9g?docId=a53662c2dddb450c977fe582ff1985a7 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |work=The New York Times |date=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before, on 11 December, General Salami stated that &quot;no nation welcomes other countries' spy drones in its territory, and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General: Iran won't return U.S. drone it claims to have |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-12-11/middleeast/world_meast_iran-us-drone_1_spy-drones-rq-170-unmanned-aircraft?_s=PM:MIDDLEEAST |accessdate=13 December 2011 |publisher=CNN |date=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 2011, Defence Minister of Iran, dismissed the request and said &quot;Instead of apologising to the Iranian nation, it is brazenly asking for the drone back.&quot; And the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|ministry spokesman]], [[Ramin Mehmanparast|Mehmanparast]], stated that &quot;it seems he [Obama] has forgotten that Iran’s airspace was violated, spying operations were undertaken, international laws were violated and that Iran’s internal affairs were interfered with. ... Instead of an official apology and admitting to this violation, they are making this request.&quot;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran says captured US drone is their 'property' now |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/8952827/Iran-says-captured-US-drone-is-their-property-now.html |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=13 December 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former U.S. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] criticised Obama's decisions on the drone, saying that, after the aircraft went down, the president should have ordered an air strike within Iran: &quot;The right response to that would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it. You can do that from the air ... and, in effect, make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone.&quot; Instead, &quot;he asked nicely for them to return it, and they aren't going to&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/12/world/meast/iran-us-drone/?hpt=hp_t1 |title=Obama says U.S. has asked Iran to return drone aircraft |date=13 December 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January 2012, an Iranian company said it would send miniature, pink, toy versions of the captured drone to President Obama as a response to the request for sending the drone back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/18/world/meast/iran-drone-replicas/index.html|title=Iranian company wants to send toy drone to Obama - CNN.com|last=CNN|first=From Shirzad Bozorgmehr|website=CNN|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rt.com/news/iran-us-drone-toy-965/|title=Iran to return US secret drone... as a toy|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse engineering of the drone==
On 10 December 2011, Iran announced that it intended to carry out [[reverse engineering]] on the captured RQ-170 Sentinel [[stealth aircraft]].&lt;ref name=prtessTV10 /&gt; In April 2012, the [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution]] claimed to have succeeded in extracting the entirety of the data collected by the drone and are currently in the process of building a replica of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite news | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/04/22/MN081O7FOC.DTL | title = Iran says it has gleaned data from U.S. spy drone | date = 22 April 2012 | accessdate =23 April 2012 |work=San Francisco Chronicle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran claimed to have been approached by countries, including China and Russia, seeking information on the drone.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/19/russia-china-seek-info-on-us-drone-held-by-iran594880/ | title = Russia, China seek info on US drone held by Iran | date = 19 April 2012 | accessdate =23 April 2012 | work = [[Fox News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although U.S. officials expressed concern over the possibility of China or Russia receiving the drone's technology, they cast doubt on whether Iran could replicate the technology of the aircraft, as well as the amount of intelligence data available, due to the precautions installed for malfunctioning drones.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/04/23/officials-challenge-iran-claims-on-us-drone-despite-concerns-about-working-with/ | title = Officials challenge Iran claims on US drone – despite concerns about value to Russia, China | date = 23 April 2012 | work = [[Fox News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 2014, Iranian state TV displayed what was claimed to be a reverse engineered RQ-170. Sources familiar with the RQ-170's design say that the Iranian RQ-170 is merely a static mock-up rather than a flyable aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usni.org/2014/05/12/iranian-copy-u-s-unamnned-stealth-aircraft-fake|title=Iranian Copy of U.S. Unmanned Stealth Aircraft is a Fake|date=2014-05-12|website=USNI News|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 Iran claimed to have carried out a successful test flight of an aircraft based on reverse engineering of the RQ-170.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defenceradar.com/2014/11/10/iran-carries-successful-test-flight-of-reverse-engineered-rq-170/|title=Iran carries successful test flight of reverse engineered RQ-170 |date=Nov 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decoded footage obtained from captured US drone ==
On 7 February 2013, Iran released video footage allegedly from the RQ-170 stealth plane. They claim the footage shows the drone coming in for a landing at the Kandahar base. Commander of the Aerospace Division of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Brigadier General Amir-Ali Hajizadeh said in February that all the data on the downed drone was “fully decoded.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran releases decoded footage obtained from captured US drone|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/02/07/287743/iran-releases-decoded-video-from-us-drone/|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=RT|title=Iran releases video 'proof' US drone decoded (VIDEO)|url=http://rt.com/news/iran-us-drone-decoded-609/|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=BBC|title=Iran shows 'hacked US spy drone' video footage|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21373353|accessdate=7 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
