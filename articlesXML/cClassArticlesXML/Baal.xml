The [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Masoretic Text|compiled]] and [[development of the Hebrew Bible canon|curated]] over a span of centuries, includes early use of the term in reference to [[God in Judaism|their God]] [[Yahweh]], generic use in reference to various Levantine deities, and finally pointed application towards Hadad, who was decried as a [[false god]]. This use was taken over into [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sometimes under the opprobrious form [[Beelzebub]].

{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}

==Word==
The spelling &quot;Baal&quot; derives from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''Báal'' ({{lang|grc|Βάαλ}}), which appears in the [[New Testament]]{{sfnp|Strong|1890|loc=[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G896 G896]}} and [[Septuagint]],{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} and from its [[latinization of names|Latinized]] form ''{{lang|la|Baal}}'', which appears in the [[Vulgate]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} The word's [[Bible|Biblical]] senses as a Phoenician deity and [[false god]]s generally were extended during the [[Protestant Reformation]] to denote any [[idolatry|idols]], [[icon]]s of the [[saint (Christianity)|saint]]s, or the [[Catholic Church]] generally.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1885), &quot;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14177 Baalist, ''n.'']&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In such contexts, it follows the anglicized pronunciation and usually omits any mark between its two As.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; In modern scholarship, the [[ʿ|half ring]] {{nowrap|{{angle brackets| ʿ }}}} or [[apostrophe]] {{nowrap|{{angle brackets| ' }}}} in the name Baʿal marks the word's original [[glottal stop]], a vocalization which appears in the middle of the [[English language|English]] word &quot;uh-oh&quot;.{{sfnp|Cleghorn &amp; al.|2011|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=RJKZAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}

The [[Northwest Semitic languages]]—[[Ugaritic]], [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Amorite language|Amorite]], and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]—were all [[abjad]]s, typically written without [[vowel]]s.{{refn|group=n|The exceptions to this general rule developed over the first millennia&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}} and are known as ''{{lang|la|[[mater lectionis]]}}''.}} As such, the word ''baʿal'' was usually written as BʿL ([[bet (letter)|bet]]-[[ayin]]-[[lamedh]]); its vowels have been [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]]. In these languages, ''baʿal'' signified &quot;[[property|owner]]&quot; and, by extension, &quot;lord&quot;,{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} a &quot;[[slavery|master]]&quot;, or &quot;[[husband]]&quot;.{{sfnp|Pope|2006}}{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc=&quot;[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]&quot;}} It also appears as Baʿali or Baʿaly, &quot;my Lord&quot;.{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc=&quot;[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]&quot;}} Cognates include the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''[[Bel (mythology)|Bēlu]]'' ({{lang|akk|{{linktext|𒂗}}}}),{{refn|group=n|This [[cuneiform]] is identical to the {{nowrap|{{angle bracket| [[𒂗]] }}}} which is taken as EN in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] texts. There, it has the meaning &quot;[[high priest (Sumer)|high priest]]&quot; or &quot;lord&quot; and appears in the names of the gods [[Enki]] and [[Enlil]].}} [[Amharic language|Amharic]] ''bal'' ({{lang|amh|{{linktext|ባል}}}}),{{sfnp|Kane|1990|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=H6tnix8o0mwC&amp;pg=PA861 861]}} and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''baʿl'' ({{lang|ar|{{linktext|بعل}}}}). ''Báʿal'' ({{lang|he|בַּעַל}}) and ''baʿl'' still serve as the words for &quot;husband&quot; in modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] respectively. They also appear in some contexts concerning the ownership of things or possession of traits. In [[Levantine Arabic]], ''baʿl'' also serves as an adjective describing [[agriculture|farming]] that relies on rainwater alone.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The feminine form is ''baʿalah'' ({{lang-he|[[wikt:בעלה|בַּעֲלָה]]}};{{sfnp|Strong|1890|loc=[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H1172 H1172]}} {{lang-ar|بعلـة}}), meaning &quot;mistress&quot; in the sense of a female owner or lady of the house{{sfnp|Strong|1890|loc=[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H1172 H1172]}} and still serving as a rare word for &quot;[[wife]]&quot;.{{sfnp|Wehr &amp; al.|1976|p=67}} The plural form is ''baʿalim''.

Like [[𒂗|EN]] in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''bēlu'' and [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] ''baʿal'' (as well as its feminine form ''baʿalah'') was used as a title of various deities in the [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian]] and [[Ancient Semitic religion|Semitic pantheons]]. Only a [[definitive article]], [[genitive]] or [[epithet]], or context could establish which particular god was meant.{{sfnp|Halpern|2009|p=64}}

===Hadad===
{{Main|Hadad|Adad}}
Baʿal was also used as a proper name by the third millennium&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}, when he appears in a list of deities at [[Abu Salabikh]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} Most modern scholarship asserts that this Baʿal—usually distinguished as &quot;The Lord&quot; ({{lang|he|[[wikt:ה־|ה]]{{linktext|בעל}}}}, ''Ha Baʿal'')—was identical with the [[storm god|storm]] and [[fertility god]] [[Hadad]];{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}}{{sfnp|Day|2000|p=68}}{{sfnp|Pope|2006}} it also appears in the form ''Baʿal Haddu''.{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc=&quot;[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]&quot;}}{{sfnp|Ayali-Darshan|2013|p=652}} Scholars propose that, as the cult of Hadad increased in importance, his true name came to be seen as too holy for any but the high priest to speak aloud and the alias &quot;Lord&quot; (&quot;Baʿal&quot;) was used instead, as &quot;[[Bel (god)|Bel]]&quot; was used for [[Marduk]] and &quot;[[Adonai]]&quot; for [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]. A minority propose that Baʿal was a native [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] deity whose cult was identified with or absorbed aspects of [[Adad]]'s.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} Regardless of their original relationship, by the 1st millennium&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}, the two were distinct: Hadad was worshipped by the [[Aramaeans]] and Baʿal by the [[Phoenicians]] and other [[Canaanites]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}}

===El===
{{hatnote|Main: [[El (god)|El]]}}
The [[Phoenician religion|Phoenician]] Baʿal is generally identified with either [[El (god)|El]] or [[Dagan (god)|Dagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Decker |first=Roy |contribution=Carthaginian Religion |contribution-url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/uc_decker_carthrel2.htm |title=Ancient/Classical History |publisher=[[About.com]] |date=2001 |location=New York |p=2 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baʿal===
{{See also|Baal cycle}}

Baʿal is well-attested in surviving inscriptions and was popular in [[theophoric name]]s throughout the Levant{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=133}} but he is usually mentioned along with other gods, &quot;his own field of action being seldom defined&quot;.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=134}} Nonetheless, Ugaritic records show him as a [[weather god]], with particular power over [[lightning god|lightning]], [[wind god|wind]], [[rain god|rain]], and [[fertility god|fertility]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=134}}{{refn|group=n|In surviving accounts, Baʿal's power over fertility extends only over vegetation. Older scholarship claimed Baʿal controlled human fertility as well, but did so on the basis of misinterpretation or of inscriptions now regarded as dubious.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|pp=134–135}} Similarly, 19th-century scholarship treating Baal as a [[anthropomorphism|personification]] of the [[sun]] seems to have been badly taken. The [[astrotheology]] of Near Eastern deities was an [[Iron Age]] development long postdating the [[origin of religion]] and, following its development, [[Bel (god)|Bel]] and Baʿal were associated with the planet [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]].{{sfnp|Smith &amp; al.|1899}} The sun was worshipped in Canaan as either the goddess [[Shapash]] or the god [[Shamash]].}} The dry summers of the area were explained as Baʿal's time in the [[underworld]] and his return in autumn was said to cause the storms which revived the land.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=134}} Thus, the worship of Baʿal in [[Canaan]]—where he eventually supplanted [[El (god)|El]] as the leader of the gods and patron of kingship—was connected to the regions' dependence on rainfall for its agriculture, unlike [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], which focused on irrigation from their major rivers. Anxiety about the availability of water for crops and trees increased the importance of his cult, which focused attention on his role as a rain god.{{sfnp|Pope|2006}} He was also called upon during battle, showing that he was thought to intervene actively in the world of man,{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=134}} unlike the more aloof El. The Lebanese city of [[Baalbeck]] was named after Baal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Batuman |first=Elif |contribution=The Myth of the Megalith |contribution-url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/baalbek-myth-megalith |title=[[The New Yorker]] |date=18 December 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baʿal of Ugarit was the epithet of Hadad but as the time passed, the epithet became the god's name while Hadad became the epithet.&lt;ref name=&quot;blok&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=zfFeCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA216|title=The Splintered Divine: A Study of Istar, Baal, and Yahweh Divine Names and Divine Multiplicity in the Ancient Near East|page= 216|year= 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baʿal was usually said to be the son of [[Dagan (god)|Dagan]], but appears as one of the sons of El in [[Ugarit]]ic sources.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=133}}{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc=&quot;[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]&quot;}}{{refn|group=n|[[Wolfgang Herrmann|Herrmann]] argues against seeing these separate lineages literally, instead proposing that they describe Baʿal's roles. As a god, he is understood as a child of El, &quot;father of gods&quot;, while his fertility aspects connect him to the [[grain god]] Dagan.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=133}}}} Both Baʿal and El were [[sacred bull|associated with the bull]] in Ugaritic texts, as it symbolized both strength and fertility.{{sfnp|Miller|2000|p=32}} The [[holy virgin|virgin]] goddess [[ʿAnat]] was his sister and sometimes credited with a child through him.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} He held special enmity against snakes, both on their own and as representatives of [[Yammu]] (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Sea&quot;), the Canaanite [[List of water deities|sea god and river god]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}} He fought the [[Tannin (monster)|Tannin]] (''Tunnanu''), the &quot;Twisted Serpent&quot; (''Bṭn ʿqltn''), &quot;[[Litan]] the Fugitive Serpent&quot; (''Ltn Bṭn Brḥ'', the Biblical [[Leviathan]]),{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}} and the &quot;[[seven-headed serpent|Mighty One with Seven Heads]]&quot; (''Šlyṭ D.šbʿt Rašm'').{{sfnp|Uehlinger|1999|p=512}}{{refn|group=n|The account is [[lacuna (MS)|patchy]] and obscure here. Some scholars take some or all of the terms to refer to [[Litan]] and in other passages [[ʿAnat]] takes credit for destroying the monsters on Baʿal's behalf. [[Wolfgang Herrmann|Herrmann]] takes &quot;Šalyaṭu&quot; as a proper name{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}} rather than translating it as the &quot;powerful one&quot; or &quot;tyrant&quot;.{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA810 &quot;šlyṭ&quot;]}}}} Baʿal's conflict with Yammu is now generally regarded as the prototype of the vision recorded in the [[Daniel 7|7th chapter]] of the [[Holy Bible|Biblical]] [[Book of Daniel]].{{sfnp|Collins|1984|p=77}} As vanquisher of the sea, Baʿal was regarded by the Canaanites and Phoenicians as the [[patron deity|patron]] of [[sailors]] and sea-going merchants.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}} As vanquisher of [[Mot (god)|Mot]], the Canaanite [[death god]], he was known as Baʿal Rāpiʾuma (''Bʿl Rpu'') and regarded as the leader of the [[Rephaim]] (''Rpum''), the ancestral spirits, particularly those of ruling dynasties.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}}

From Canaan, worship of Baʿal spread to Egypt by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and throughout the [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] following the waves of [[Phoenician colonization]] in the early 1st millennium&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=133}} He was described with diverse epithets and, prior to the rediscovery of Ugarit, it was supposed that these referred to distinct local gods.

===Baʿal Hammon===
{{main|Baʿal Hammon}}
[[Baʿal Hammon]] was worshipped in the [[Ancient Tyre|Tyrian]] [[Phoenician colonization|colony]] of [[Carthage]] as their [[King of the Gods|supreme god]]. It is believed that this position developed in the 5th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}} following the severing of its ties to [[Ancient Tyre|Tyre]] following the 480&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}} [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]].{{sfnp|Moscati|2001|p=132}} Like Hadad, Baʿal Hammon was a [[fertility god]].{{sfnp|Lancel|1995|p=197}} Inscriptions about [[Carthaginian religion|Punic deities]] tend to be rather uninformative, though, and he has been variously identified as a [[moon god]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Yigael Yadin]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[Dagan (god)|Dagan]], the [[grain god]].{{sfnp|Lipiński|1992}} Rather than the bull, Baʿal Hammon was associated with the [[Sheep|ram]] and depicted with his horns. The archaeological record seems to bear out accusations in Roman sources that the Carthaginians [[Carthaginian human sacrifice|burned their children as human sacrifices]] to him. He was worshipped as Baʿal Karnaim (&quot;Lord of the Two Horns&quot;), particularly at an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Bu Kornein (&quot;Two-Horn Hill&quot;) across the bay from Carthage. His consort was the goddess [[Tanit]].{{sfnp|Lancel|1995|p=195}}

The epithet Hammon is obscure. Most often, it is connected with the NW Semitic ''ḥammān'' (&quot;[[brazier]]&quot;) and associated with a role as a [[sun god]].{{sfnp|Walbank|1979|p=47}} [[Ernest Renan|Renan]] and [[John Clark Love Gibson|Gibson]] linked it to Hammon (modern Umm el-‘Amed between [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in [[Israel]]){{sfnp|Gibson|1982|p=39 &amp; 118}} and [[Frank Moore Cross|Cross]] and [[Edward Lipiński (orientalist)|Lipiński]] to Haman or Khamōn, the classical [[Mount Amanus]] and modern Nur Mountains, which separate northern [[Syria]] from southeastern [[Cilicia]].{{sfnp|Cross|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bJqwWRDOMgEC&amp;pg=PA26 26–28]}}{{sfnp|Lipiński|1994|p=207}}

==Judaism==
Baʿal appears about 90 times in the [[Hebrew Scriptures]] in reference to various gods.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} The priests of the Canaanite Baʿal are mentioned numerous times, most prominently in the [[First Book of Kings]]. Many scholars believe that this describes [[Jezebel]]'s attempt to introduce the worship of the Baʿal of [[Ancient Tyre|Tyre]], [[Melqart]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities (Josephus)|Antiquities]]'', 8.13.1.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israeli]] capital [[Samaria]] in the 9th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}.{{sfnp|''BEWR''|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbibAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 &quot;Baal&quot;]}} Against this, [[John Day (Old Testament scholar)|Day]] argues that Jezebel's Baʿal was more probably [[Baʿal Shamem]], the Lord of the Heavens, a title most often applied to Hadad, who is also often titled just Ba‘al.{{sfnp|Day|2000|p=75}} The [[Hebrew Scriptures]] record an account of a contest between the [[prophet (Bible)|prophet]] [[Elijah]] and Jezebel's priests. Both sides offered a [[sacrifice]] to their respective gods: Ba'al failed to light his followers' sacrifice while [[Yahweh]]'s heavenly fire burnt Elijah's altar to ashes, even after it had been soaked with water. The observers then followed Elijah's instructions to slay the priests of Baʿal, after which it began to rain,&lt;ref name=elijah&gt;{{bibleref|1 Kings|18|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; showing Yahweh's mastery over the weather. Other mentions of the priests of Baʿal describe their burning of [[incense]] in [[prayer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|2 Kings|23:5|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and their offering of [[sacrifice]] while adorned in special [[vestment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|2 Kings|10:22|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yahweh===
{{main|Yahweh|Names of God in Judaism}}
The title ''baʿal'' was a synonym in some contexts of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''[[adon]]'' (&quot;Lord&quot;) and ''[[adonai]]'' (&quot;My Lord&quot;) still used as aliases of the Lord of Israel [[Yahweh]]. According to some scholars, the [[Hebrew people|early Hebrews]] did use the names Baʿal (&quot;Lord&quot;) and Baʿali (&quot;My Lord&quot;) in reference to the Lord of Israel, just as Baʿal farther north designated the Lord of [[Ugarit]] or Lebanon.{{sfnp|''BEWR''|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbibAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 &quot;Baal&quot;]}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|loc=&quot;[[s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Baal|Baal]]&quot;}} This occurred both directly and as the divine element of some Hebrew [[theophoric name]]s. However, according to others it is not certain that the name Baal was definitely applied to Yahweh in early Israelite history. The component Baal in proper names is mostly applied to worshippers of Baal, or descendants of the worshippers of Baal.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=136}} Names including the element Baʿal presumably in reference to Yahweh{{sfnp|Ayles|1904|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nwQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA103 103]}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|loc=&quot;[[s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Baal|Baal]]&quot;}} include the [[judge (Judaism)|judge]] [[Gideon]] (also known as Jerubaʿal, {{abbr|lit.|literally}}&amp;nbsp;&quot;The Lord Strives&quot;), [[Saul the King|Saul]]'s son [[Ish-bosheth|Eshbaʿal]] (&quot;The Lord is Great&quot;), and [[David]]'s son Beeliada (&quot;The Lord Knows&quot;). The name [[Bealiah]] (&quot;The Lord is [[Jah]]&quot;; &quot;Yahweh is Baʿal&quot;){{sfnp|''AYBD''|1992|loc=&quot;Baal (Deity)&quot;}} combined the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1 Chron.|12:5|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Easton|1893|loc=&quot;[https://archive.org/stream/illustratedbible00east#page/86/mode/2up Beali′ah]&quot;}} However John Day states that as far as the names Eshba’al, Meriba’al, and Beeliada (that is Baaliada), are concerned it is not certain whether they simply allude to the Cannanite god Ba’al, or are intended to equate Yahweh with Ba’al, or have no connection to Ba’al.{{sfnp|Day|2000|p=72}}

It was the program of [[Jezebel]], in the 9th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}, to introduce into Israel's capital city of Samaria her Phoenician worship of Baal as opposed to the worship of [[Yahweh]] that made the name anathema to the Israelites.{{sfnp|''BEWR''|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbibAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 &quot;Baal&quot;]}}
{{quote|At first the name Baal&lt;!--sic--&gt; was used by the [[Jews]] for their God without discrimination, but as the struggle between the two religions developed, the name Baal was given up by the Israelites as a thing of shame, and even names like Jerubbaal&lt;!--sic--&gt; were changed to Jerubbosheth: Hebrew ''bosheth'' means &quot;shame&quot;.{{sfnp|''ZPBD''|1963}}}} Eshbaʿal became [[Ish-bosheth]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and Meribaʿal became [[Mephibosheth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1 Chron.|9:40|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but other possibilities also occurred. Beeliada is mentioned renamed as Eliada{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and Gideon's name Jerubaʿal was mentioned intact but glossed as a mockery of the Canaanite god, implying that he strove in vain.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Judges|6:32|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct use of Baʿali continued at least as late as the time of the [[prophet (Judaism)|prophet]] [[Hosea]], who reproached the Israelites for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Hosea|2:16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brad E. Kelle has suggested that references to cultic sexual practices in the worship of Baal, in Hosea 2, are evidence of an historical situation in which Israelites were either giving up Yahweh worship for Baal, or blending the two.  Hosea's references to sexual acts being metaphors for Israelite 'apostasy'.&lt;ref&gt;title = Hosea 2: Metaphor and Rhetoric in Historical Perspective | author = Brad E.

===Baʿal Berith===
{{main|Baʿal Berith}}
[[Baʿal Berith]] (&quot;Lord of the [[Biblical covenant|Covenant]]&quot;) was a god worshipped by the [[Israelites]] when they &quot;went astray&quot; after the death of [[Gideon]] according to the [[Hebrew Scriptures]].&lt;ref name=jdg8&gt;{{bibleref|Jdg.|8:33–34|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same source relates that Gideon's son [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] went to his mother's kin at [[Shechem]] and received 70 [[shekel]]s of [[silver]] &quot;from the House of Baʿal Berith&quot; to assist in killing his 70 brothers from Gideon's other wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Jdg.|9:1–5|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier passage had made Shechem the scene of [[Joshua]]'s covenant between all the [[tribes of Israel]] and &quot;[[El (god)|El]] [[Yahweh]], our [[El (god)|god]] of [[Israelites|Israel]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Josh.|24:1–25|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a later one describes it as the location of the &quot;House of El Berith&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Jdg.|9:46|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus unclear whether the false worship of the &quot;Baʿalim&quot; being decried&lt;ref name=jdg8/&gt; is the worship of a new idol or the continued worship of Yahweh, but by means of rites and [[henotheism|teachings]] taking him to be a mere local god within a larger pantheon. The Hebrew Scriptures record the worship of Baʿal threatening [[Israelites|Israel]] from the time of the [[Judge (Judaism)|Judges]] until the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|monarchy]].{{sfnp|Smith|2002|loc=Ch.&amp;nbsp;2}} The [[Deuteronomist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Deut.|4:1–40|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the present form of [[Book of Jeremiah#Composition|Jeremiah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Jer.|11:12–13|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; seem to phrase the struggle as [[monolatry]] or [[monotheism]] against [[polytheism]]. However, Yahweh is firmly identified in the Hebrew Scriptures with [[El (god)|El]], whose [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] figure appears hostile to the cult of Baʿal even in the polytheistic accounts of Ugarit{{which|date=August 2015}} and the Phoenician cities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sanchuniathon]]''.{{where?|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beelzebub===
{{Main|Beelzebub}}
[[Baʿal Zebub]] ({{lang-he|{{linktext|בעל זבוב}}}}, &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;[[Fly]] Lord&quot;){{sfnp|Arndt &amp; al.|2000|p=173}}{{sfnp|Balz &amp; al.|2004|p=211}}{{refn|group=n|&quot;The etymology of Beelzebul has proceeded in several directions. The variant reading Beelzebub (Syriac translators and Jerome) reflects a long-standing tradition of equating Beelzebul with the Philistine deity of the city of Ekron mentioned in 2 Kgs 1:2, 3, 6, 16. Baalzebub (Heb ba˓al zĕbûb) seems to mean “lord of flies” (HALAT, 250, but cf. LXXB baal muian theon akkarōn, “Baal-Fly, god of Akkaron”; Ant 9:2, 1 theon muian).&quot;{{sfnp|''AYBD''|1992|loc=&quot;Beelzebul&quot;}}}} occurs in the first chapter of the [[Second Book of Kings]] as the supposed name of the [[Philistines|Philistine]] god of [[Ekron]]. In it, [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]], [[kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|king of Israel]], is said to have consulted the priests of Baʿal Zebub as to whether he would survive the injuries from his recent fall. The [[prophet (Judaism)|prophet]] [[Elijah]], incensed at this impiety, then foretold that he would die quickly, raining heavenly fire on the soldiers sent to punish him for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|2 Kings|1:1–18|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish]] scholars have interpreted the title of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as the Hebrew way of calling Baʿal a [[feces|pile of dung]] and his followers [[vermin]],{{sfnp|Easton|1893|loc=&quot;[https://archive.org/stream/illustratedbible00east#page/88/mode/2up Beel′zebub]&quot;}}{{sfnp|Kohler|1902}}{{sfnp|Lurker|1987|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vtj0wSsw1JcC&amp;pg=PA31 31]}} although others argue for a link to power over causing and curing [[infection|pestilence]] and thus suitable for Ahaziah's question.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999b}} The [[Septuagint]] renders the name as ''Baälzeboúb'' ({{lang|grc|βααλζεβούβ}}) and as &quot;Baʿal of Flies&quot; ({{lang|grc|βααλ μυιαν}}, ''Baäl muian''). [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]] the [[Ebionites|Ebionite]] rendered it as ''Beëlzeboúl'' ({{lang|grc|Βεελζεβούλ}}), possibly reflecting its original sense.{{sfnp|Souvay|1907}}{{refn|group=n|Arndt &amp; al. reverse this, saying Symmachus transcribed ''Baälzeboúb'' for a more common ''Beëlzeboúl''.{{sfnp|Arndt &amp; al.|2000|p=173}}}} This has been proposed to have been ''B‘l Zbl'', [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] for &quot;Lord of the Home&quot; or &quot;Lord of the Heavens&quot;.{{sfnp|Wex|2005}}{{refn|group=n|&quot;It is more probable that b‘l zbl, which can mean “lord of the (heavenly) dwelling” in Ugaritic, was changed to b‘l zbb to make the divine name an opprobrius epithet. The reading Beelzebul in Mt. 10:25 would then reflect the right form of the name, a wordplay on “master of the house” (Gk oikodespótēs).&quot;{{sfnp|McIntosh|1989}}}}{{refn|group=n|&quot;An alternative suggested by many is to connect zĕbûl with a noun meaning '(exalted) abode.'&quot;{{sfnp|''AYBD''|1992|loc=&quot;Beelzebul&quot;}}}}{{refn|group=n|&quot;In contemporary Semitic speech it may have been understood as ‘the master of the house’; if so, this phrase could be used in a double sense in Mt. 10:25b.&quot;{{sfnp|Bruce|1996}}}}

==Classical sources==
Outside of Jewish and Christian contexts, the various forms of Baʿal were indifferently rendered in classical sources as [[Belus (disambiguation)|Belus]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Βῆλος}}, ''Bē̂los''). An example is [[Josephus]], who states that [[Jezebel]] &quot;built a temple to the [[patron deity|god]] of the [[Tyrians]], which they call Belus&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; this describes the Baʿal of Tyre, [[Melqart]]. In the ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'', Baʿal was usually associated with [[Jupiter Belus]] but sometimes connected with [[Hercules]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Wolfgang Herrmann|Herrmann]] identifies the [[Demarus]] or Demarous mentioned by [[Philo Byblius]] as Baʿal.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}}

[[Baʿal Hammon]], however, was identified with the [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]] [[Cronus|Cronos]] and the [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman]] [[Saturn (god)|Saturn]] (as the &quot;[[Africa (Rome)|African]] Saturn&quot;). He was probably never equated with Melqart, although this assertion appears in older scholarship.

==Christianity==
[[Beelzebub]] or Beelzebul was identified by the [[Evangelism|writers]] of the [[New Testament]] as [[Satan]], &quot;[[prince]]&quot; (i.e., [[Prince#Prince as generic for ruler|king]]) of the [[demon]]s.{{refn|group=n|&quot;In NT Gk. beelzeboul, beezeboul (Beelzebub in TR and AV) is the prince of the demons (Mt. 12:24, 27; Mk. 3:22; Lk. 11:15, 18f.), identified with Satan (Mt. 12:26; Mk. 3:23, 26; Lk. 11:18).&quot;{{sfnp|Bruce|1996}}}}{{refn|group=n|&quot;Besides, Matt 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 use the apposition ἄρχων τῶν δαιμονίων ‘head of the →Demons’.&quot;{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999b}}}}

[[John Milton]]'s 1667 [[epic poem|epic]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' describes the [[fallen angel]]s collecting around Satan, stating that, though their heavenly names had been &quot;blotted out and ras'd&quot;, they would acquire new ones &quot;wandring ore the Earth&quot; as false gods. The &quot;Baalim&quot; and &quot;Ashtaroth&quot; are given as the collective names of the male and female demons (respectively) who came from between the &quot;bordring flood of old [[Euphrates]]&quot; and &quot;the [[Brook of Egypt|Brook]] that parts [[Egypt (region)|Egypt]] from [[Syria (region)|Syrian ground]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Milton|Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', Bk.&amp;nbsp;1, ll.&amp;nbsp;419–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, &quot;Baal&quot; and derived epithets like &quot;Baalist&quot; were used as slurs during the [[English Reformation]] for the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[saint (Christianity)|saints]] and their devotees.

==Islam==
The [[Quran]] mentions the contest between [[Jezebel]]'s priests of [[Baʿal]] and the [[prophet (Judaism)|prophet]] [[Elijah]]&lt;ref name=elijah/&gt; (renamed [[Elias]]):
{{quote|And [[Elias]] was most surely of the [[prophet (Islam)|messengers]]. He asked his people: 'Do you not fear &amp;#91;[[Allah|God]]&amp;#93;? Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the best of creators? God is your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, the ancients' But they rejected him, and they will certainly be called up [for [[Hell (Islam)|punishment]]&amp;#93;, except the sincere and devoted [[Muslims|servants of God]] [among them], and we left [this blessing] for him among generations [to come] in later times, peace be upon [[Elias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|123|e=130|s=ns}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The name Beelzebub also appears in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources as &quot;the Lord of the Flies&quot; ({{lang|ar|بعل الذباب}}, ''Ba‘al dhubaab'' or ''zubaab'').{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
