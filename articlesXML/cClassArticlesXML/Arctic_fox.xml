The '''Arctic fox''' (''Vulpes lagopus''), also known as the '''white fox''', '''polar fox''', or '''snow fox''', is a small [[fox]] native to the [[Arctic]] regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and common throughout the [[Tundra#Arctic tundra|Arctic tundra]] [[biome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=msw3&gt;{{MSW3 Wozencraft |id=14000873}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well [[adaptation|adapted]] to living in cold environments. It has a deep thick fur which is brown in summer and white in winter. Its body length ranges from {{convert|46|to|68|cm|abbr=on}}, with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of [[body heat]].

The Arctic fox preys on any small creatures such as: [[lemming]]s, [[vole]]s, [[ringed seal]] pups, fish, waterfowl, and [[seabird]]s. It also eats [[carrion]], berries, seaweed, insects, and other small invertebrates. Arctic foxes form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pairs during the breeding season and they stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens. Occasionally, other family members may assist in raising their young.

==Adaptations==
[[File:Alopex lagopus IMG 9019.JPG|thumb|left|Arctic fox sleeping with its tail wrapped around itself]]
The Arctic fox lives in some of the most frigid extremes on the planet but does not start to shiver until the temperature drops to {{convert|-70|°C}}. Among its [[adaptation]]s for survival in the cold is its dense, multilayered [[pelage]], which provides excellent insulation,&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Sillero-Zubiri, Michael Hoffmann and David W. Macdonald (eds.) (2004). [http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/actionplans/canids.pdf Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals and Dogs]. IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group.&lt;/ref&gt; a system of [[Countercurrent exchange|countercurrent heat exchange]] in the circulation within the paws to retain [[wiktionary:core temperature|core temperature]], and a good supply of [[Adipose tissue|body fat]]. The fox has a low [[surface area to volume ratio]], as evidenced by its generally compact body shape, short muzzle and legs, and short, thick ears. Since less of its surface area is exposed to the Arctic cold, less heat escapes from its body. Its paws have fur on the soles for additional insulation and to help it walk on ice. Its fur changes color with the seasons: in most populations it is white in the winter to blend in with snow, while in the summer it is greyish-brown or darker brown. In some populations, however, it is a steely bluish-gray in the winter and a paler bluish-gray in summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot; /&gt; The fur of the Arctic fox provides the best insulation of any mammal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAPT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/arctic44-2-132.pdf|title=Adaptations by the arctic fox to the polar winter|accessdate=2015-10-08|publisher=Arctic, vol.44 no.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arctic fox has such keen hearing, it can determine exactly where a small animal is moving under the snow. When it has located its prey, it pounces and punches through the snow to catch its victim. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;DECGNL&quot;&gt;[http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/snp/programs/education/animal_facts/mammals/arctic_fox.html Arctic Fox ''Alopex lagopus'']. Department of Environment and Conservation, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Arctic foxes do not [[Hibernation|hibernate]] and are active all year round. They build up their fat reserves in the autumn, sometimes increasing their body weight by more than 50%. This provides greater insulation during the winter and a source of energy when food is scarce. They live in large dens in frost-free, slightly raised ground. These are complex systems of tunnels covering as much as {{convert|1000|m2|yd2|abbr=on}} and are often in [[esker]]s, long ridges of sedimentary material deposited in formerly [[Glacier|glaciated]] regions. They have multiple entrances and may have been in existence for many decades and used by many generations of foxes.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

Arctic foxes tend to form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pairs in the breeding season and maintain a territory around the den. Breeding usually takes place in April and May, and the [[gestation period]] is about 52 days. Litters tend to average five to eight kits, but exceptionally contain as many as 25 (the largest litter size in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=David W.|title=Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-851556-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the mother and father help to raise the young which emerge from the den when 3 to 4 weeks old and are weaned by 9 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

==Diet==
Arctic foxes generally eat any small animal they can find, including [[lemming]]s, [[vole]]s, other rodents, [[hare]]s, [[bird]]s, [[Egg (food)|egg]]s, fish, and [[carrion]]. They scavenge on carcasses left by larger predators such as wolves and [[polar bear]]s, and in times of scarcity even eat their [[feces]]. In areas where they are present, lemmings are their most common prey,&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; and a family of foxes can eat dozens of lemmings each day. In some locations in northern Canada, a high seasonal abundance of migrating birds that breed in the area may provide an important food source. On the coast of Iceland and other islands, their diet consists predominantly of birds. During April and May, the Arctic fox also preys on [[ringed seal]] pups when the young animals are confined to a snow den and are relatively helpless. They also consume berries and seaweed, so they may be considered [[omnivore]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bockstoce2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bockstoce, John R. |title=Furs and frontiers in the far north: the contest among native and foreign nations for the Bering Strait fur trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HY6LvFMSxxwC&amp;pg=PA41|year =2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-14921-0|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fox is a significant bird-egg predator, consuming eggs of all except the largest tundra bird species.&lt;ref name=truett&gt;{{cite book|author1=Truett, Joe Clyde  |author2=Johnson, Stephen R. |title=The natural history of an Arctic oil field: development and the biota|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELsq-yAP0XkC&amp;pg=PA161|year=2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-701235-3|pages=160–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; When food is overabundant, the Arctic fox buries (caches) the surplus as a reserve.

==Size==
The average head-and-body length of the male is {{convert|55|cm|abbr=on}}, with a range of {{convert|46|to|68|cm|abbr=on}}, while the female averages {{convert|52|cm|abbr=on}} with a range of {{convert|41|to|55|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/arctic-fox/ |title=Arctic fox: ''Alopex lagopus''|work=National Geographic |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some regions, no difference in size is seen between males and females.

==Taxonomy==
''Vulpes lagopus'' is a 'true fox' belonging to the genus ''[[Vulpes]]'' of the fox [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Vulpini]]. It is classified under the [[subfamily (biology)|subfamily]] [[Caninae]] of the canid [[family (biology)|family]] [[Canidae]]. Although it has previously been assigned to its own [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] [[genus]] ''Alopex'', recent [[genetics|genetic]] evidence now places it in the genus ''Vulpes'' along with the majority of other foxes.&lt;ref name=msw3/&gt;&lt;ref name=complete&gt;{{cite journal|title=Building large trees by combining phylogenetic information: a complete phylogeny of the extant Carnivora (Mammalia)|journal=Biol.

It was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']] in 1758 as ''Canis lagopus''. The [[type specimen]] was recovered from [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]], [[Sweden]]. The generic name ''vulpes'' is [[Latin]] for &quot;fox&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lariviere&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author= Larivière, Serge |year=2002|title=''Vulpes zerda''|journal=Mammalian Species|issue=714|pages=1&amp;ndash;5|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/714_Vulpes_zerda.pdf|doi= 10.1644/1545-1410(2002)714&lt;0001:VZ&gt;2.0.CO;2|volume= 714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific name ''lagopus'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] λαγώς (''lagos'', &quot;[[hare]]&quot;) and πούς (''pous'', &quot;foot&quot;), referring to the hair on its feet similar to those found in cold-climate species of hares.&lt;ref name=&quot;audet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Audet, Alexander M. |author2=Robbins, C.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Arctic fox has a circumpolar distribution and occurs in Arctic tundra habitats in northern Europe, northern Asia, and North America. Its range includes Greenland, Iceland, Fennoscandia, [[Svalbard]], [[Jan Mayen]] and other islands in the [[Barents Sea]], northern Russia, islands in the [[Bering Sea]], [[Alaska]], and Canada as far south as [[Hudson Bay]]. In the late 19th century, it was introduced into the [[Aleutian Islands]] southwest of Alaska. It mostly inhabits tundra and [[pack ice]], but is also present in [[boreal forest]]s in Canada and the [[Kenai Peninsula]] in Alaska. They are found at elevations up to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level and have been seen on sea ice close to the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name=Feldhamer&gt;{{cite book|author1=George A. Feldhamer|author2=Bruce C. Thompson|author3=Joseph A. Chapman|title=Wild Mammals of North America: Biology, Management, and Conservation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xQalfqP7BcC&amp;pg=PA540 |year=2003 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-7416-1 |pages=511–540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic fox is the only land mammal native to Iceland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iceland&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.is/pages/alife/biglf.html |title=Wildlife |year=2000 |work=Iceland Worldwide |publisher=iww.is |accessdate=22 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414112114/http://www.iww.is/pages/alife/biglf.html |archivedate=14 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It came to the isolated [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] island at the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], walking over the frozen sea. [[The Arctic Fox Center]] in [[Súðavík]] contains an exhibition on the Arctic fox and conducts studies on the influence of tourism on the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcticfoxcenter.com/ |title=The Arctic Fox Center |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its range during the last [[ice age]] was much more extensive than it is now, and [[fossil]] remains of the Arctic fox have been found over much of northern Europe and Siberia.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;

==Conservation status==
The conservation status of the species is in general good and several hundred thousand individuals are estimated to remain in total. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed it as being of &quot;[[least concern]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; However, the Scandinavian mainland population is acutely endangered, despite being legally protected from hunting and persecution for several decades. The estimate of the adult population in all of Norway, Sweden, and Finland is fewer than 200 individuals.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; As a result, the populations of arctic fox have been carefully studied and inventoried in places such as the [[Vindelfjällens Nature Reserve]] (Sweden), which has the arctic fox as its symbol.

The abundance of the Arctic fox tends to fluctuate in a cycle along with the population of lemmings and [[vole]]s (a 3- to 4-year cycle).&lt;ref name=truett/&gt; The populations are especially vulnerable during the years when the prey population crashes, and uncontrolled [[Animal trapping|trapping]] has almost eradicated two subpopulations.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/report12/arctic_fox.html |title=Arctic fox (''Vulpes lagopus'') |author1=Angerbjörn, A. |author2=Berteaux, D. |author3=Ims, R. |date=12 November 2012 |work=Arctic report card: Update for 2012 |publisher=NOAA Arctic Research Program |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pelts of Arctic foxes with a slate-blue coloration—an expression of a [[recessive gene]]—were especially valuable. They were transported to various previously fox-free [[Aleutian Island]]s during the 1920s. The program was successful in terms of increasing the population of blue foxes, but their predation of [[Aleutian cackling goose|Aleutian Canada geese]] conflicted with the goal of preserving that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sbYL7JNnMNIC&amp;pg=PA42|page=42|title=Ecology of North America|author=Bolen, Eric G. |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-471-13156-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic fox is losing ground to the larger [[red fox]]. This has been attributed to [[climate change]]—the camouflage value of its lighter coat decreases with less snow cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hannah2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hannah, Lee |title=Climate Change Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Vvqw2gdk9QC&amp;pg=PA63|year=2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374182-0|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red foxes dominate where their ranges begin to overlap by killing Arctic foxes and their kits.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacdonaldSillero-Zubiri2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Macdonald, David Whyte  |author2=Sillero-Zubiri, Claudio |title=The biology and conservation of wild canids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vrgow9ERQeIC&amp;pg=PA10|year= 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-851556-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate explanation of the red fox's gains involves the [[gray wolf]]. Historically, it has kept red fox numbers down, but as the wolf has been hunted to near [[extinction]] in much of its former range, the red fox population has grown larger, and it has taken over the niche of [[Apex predator|top predator]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In areas of northern Europe, programs are in place that allow the hunting of red foxes in the Arctic fox's previous range.

As with many other game species, the best sources of historical and large-scale population data are hunting bag records and questionnaires. Several potential sources of error occur in such data collections.&lt;ref name=G_and_E&gt;{{cite book |author1=Garrott, R. A.  |author2=Eberhardt, L. E. | year = 1987 | chapter = Arctic fox | editor = Novak, M. | title = Wild furbearer management and conservation in North America | pages = 395–406|isbn=0774393653|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, numbers vary widely between years due to the large population fluctuations. However, the total population of the Arctic fox must be in the order of several hundred thousand animals.&lt;ref name=Tannerfeldt&gt;{{cite book | author = Tannerfeldt, M. | year = 1997 | title = Population fluctuations and life history consequences in the Arctic fox. | publisher = Dissertation, Stockholm University | location = Stockholm, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world population of Arctic foxes is thus not endangered, but two Arctic fox subpopulations are. One is on [[Medny Island]] ([[Commander Islands]], Russia), which was reduced by some 85–90%, to around 90 animals, as a result of [[mange]] caused by an ear tick introduced by dogs in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Goltsman&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goltsman, M.| year = 1996 | last2 = Kruchenkova | first2 = E. P. | last3 = MacDonald | first3 = D. W. | title = The Mednyi Arctic foxes: treating a population imperilled by disease | journal = Oryx | volume = 30 | pages = 251–258 | doi = 10.1017/S0030605300021748 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population is currently under treatment with antiparasitic drugs, but the result is still uncertain.

The other threatened population is the one in [[Fennoscandia]] (Norway, Sweden, Finland, and [[Kola Peninsula]]). This population decreased drastically around the start of the 20th century as a result of extreme fur prices, which caused severe hunting also during population lows.&lt;ref name=Lönnberg&gt;{{cite book | author = Lönnberg, E. | year = 1927 | title = Fjällrävsstammen i Sverige 1926 | publisher = Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences | location = Uppsala, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population has remained at a low density for more than 90 years, with additional reductions during the last decade.&lt;ref name=Angerbjörn&gt;{{cite journal  | year = 1995 | title = Dynamics of the Arctic fox population in Sweden | journal = Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume = 32 | pages = 55–68|url=http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:234717| author = Angerbjörn, A. | displayauthors = etal   }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total population estimate for 1997 is around 60 adults in Sweden, 11 adults in Finland, and 50 in Norway. From Kola, there are indications of a similar situation, suggesting a population of around 20 adults. The Fennoscandian population thus numbers around 140 breeding adults. Even after local lemming peaks, the Arctic fox population tends to collapse back to levels dangerously close to nonviability.&lt;ref name=Tannerfeldt/&gt;

The Arctic fox is classed as a &quot;prohibited new organism&quot; under New Zealand's [[Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996]], preventing it from being imported into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0030/latest/DLM386556.html#DLM386556|title=Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 2003 – Schedule 2 Prohibited new organisms|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
