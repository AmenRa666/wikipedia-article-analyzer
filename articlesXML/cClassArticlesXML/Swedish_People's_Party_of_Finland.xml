The '''Swedish People's Party of Finland''' ({{lang-sv|Svenska folkpartiet i Finland (SFP)}}; {{lang-fi|Suomen ruotsalainen kansanpuolue (RKP)}}) is a [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[Centrism|centrist]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergqvist1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Christina|last=Bergqvist |title=Equal Democracies?: Gender and Politics in the Nordic Countries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8bfrJvsfJ8C&amp;pg=PA319 |year=1999 |publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers |isbn=978-82-00-12799-4 |page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[list of political parties in Finland|political party in Finland]] aiming to represent the interests of the minority [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arter1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=David|last=Arter |title=Scandinavian Politics Today |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeMS8B0oOKkC&amp;pg=PA62 |year=1999 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-5133-3 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bondeson2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Ulla|last=Bondeson |title=Nordic Moral Climates: Value Continuities and Discontinuities in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bq8boZgfvHQC&amp;pg=PA20 |year=2003 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0203-3 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrakkeKortmann2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Hans van den Brandhof |title=The Republic of Finland |editor1=Lucas Prakke |editor2=Constantijn Kortmann |work=Constitutional Law of 15 EU Member States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b5vZMPbnNXcC&amp;pg=PA183 |year=2004 |publisher=Kluwer |isbn=978-90-13-01255-2 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's main election issue has been since its inception the Swedish-speaking Finns' right to their own language and to maintain the [[Swedish language]]'s position in [[Finland]]. The party was in governmental position 1979–2015 with one or two seats in the [[Government of Finland|government]] and collaborated with the [[centre-right]] as well as the [[centre-left]] in the [[Parliament of Finland]]. After the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2015|2015 election]] SFP was left out of the government formed by the three biggest parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1430975649117|title=Perusporvarihallitus on Juha Sipilän valinta|date=8 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that both the Finnish centre-right and centre-left have needed the support from the party has meant that they have been able to affect [[politics of Finland]] in a larger scale than the party's actual size would suggest. The position of the Swedish language as one of two [[official language]]s in Finland and the Swedish-speaking minority's right to the [[Swedish-speaking Finns#Culture, literature and folklore|Swedish culture]] are two of the results of the party's influence in Finnish politics. The party is a member of [[Liberal International]] and the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) Party.

==History and electorate==
[[File:Svenska folkpartiet election poster 1907.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish People’s Party election poster from 1907, with ”the man with the flag”, that after this was used as party emblem for over 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blf.fi/artikel.php?id=3357 Biografiskt lexikon för Finland: Federley, Alex] (in Swedish). Retreieved 10 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[Alex Federley]].]] The '''Swedish Party''' (1870–1906), a parliamentary [[elite party]] based on members in the [[Diet of Finland]], is the historical predecessor of the Swedish People's Party of Finland. It was a part of the [[Svecoman]] movement and its main policy was opposition of the [[Fennoman]] movement.

Unlike Fennomans who were largely [[liberalism|liberal]] on other matters than the language question, the Svecoman were [[Conservatism|conservative]]. [[Axel Lille]] and [[Axel Olof Freudenthal]] are often considered as some of the main &quot;founding fathers&quot; of the movement. Most members of the Liberal Party joined the Swedish Party in the 1880s, after the Liberals ceased to exist as a distinct party. The Swedish People's Party of Finland was founded in the 1906 party congress of the Swedish Party, making it one of the oldest parties in Finland. The first leader of Swedish People's Party was [[Axel Lille]].

The current leader of the party is [[Anna-Maja Henriksson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1465696816216|title=Anna-Maja Henriksson valittiin Rkp:n puheenjohtajaksi – &quot;Me teimme sen. Me rikoimme lasikaton!&quot;|publisher=Helsingin sanomat|date=12 June 2016|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Parliament of Finland]] the representative for [[Åland]] is usually included in SFP's parliamentary group, regardless of his/her party affiliation. This is because [[List of political parties in Åland|the political parties in Åland]] have no counterparts in [[Mainland Finland]], but the SFP's interests have much in common with those of Åland as far as the Swedish language is concerned.

The party receives its main electoral support from the [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]] speaking minority, which makes up about 5.5% of Finland's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Finland in Figures |url=http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_vaesto_en.html |title=Tilastokeskus - Population |publisher=Stat.fi |date= |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its history, the party has suffered slow but steady decline in adherence, following the decline of the percentage of Swedish-speaking population: in 1907 it got 12% of national votes, after World War II 7% and in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary election]] 4.3% (9 MPs). In municipal elections, it holds large majorities in municipalities with a Swedish-speaking majority.

Despite its position as one of the minor political parties in the Finnish parliament it has frequently been one of the partners forming the governing [[coalition cabinet]]s. Since 1956, the year when [[Urho Kekkonen]] was elected President, the party has been nearly continuously in the government. It has been part of all coalitions with the significant exception of Paasio's first government (1966–68), which included only socialists ([[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP), the split SDP faction [[Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders]] and [[Finnish People's Democratic League]]) and the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]].

Short periods of rule by single-party minority governments, Miettunen government (1961–62, Centre) and Paasio's second government (1972, SDP) and of nonpartisan [[caretaker government]]s have also interrupted its stay in the government. For this reason, SFP is often criticized for being a single-issue party that allegedly accepts nearly all other policies as long as its own vital interest, the status of the Swedish language is maintained.

However, although Vanhanen's first government made Swedish a voluntary subject in the upper secondary school's [[matriculation exam]], SFP remained in the government. In contrast, the [[Green League|Greens]] left the previous government after a new nuclear power plant was decided in 2002.

Recently the SFP has emphasized the liberal part of its programme, attempting to woo voters outside its traditional Swedish-speaking electorate. In 2010, the party added the word ''Suomen'' (&quot;of Finland&quot;) to its official Finnish name.

==Political positions==
{{refimprove|date=March 2011}}
The Swedish language is one of the two [[official language]]s of Finland. The SFP has as its main raison d'être the protection and strengthening of the position of the [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish language in Finland]].

The Swedish People's Party of Finland has the most eclectic profile of any of the political parties in Finland, its members and supporters including (chiefly):
* fishermen and farmers from the Swedish-speaking coastal areas.
* small-town dwellers from the adjacent Swedish-speaking and bi-lingual towns.
* green-minded and left-leaning middle-class intellectuals.
* liberals in general, who currently have no representation of their own in the Finnish parliament, and who as such benefit from the predominantly liberal values of the SFP.

Although the SFP represents a small minority of Finland, Swedish mother tongue per se is not much of a political handicap. Several times Swedish speaking [[President of Finland|president]]ial candidates have gathered considerable support, although not necessarily as candidates for the Swedish People's Party of Finland:
* In 1956 the Swedish-speaking [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrat]] [[Karl-August Fagerholm|Fagerholm]] got one elector's vote less than needed to be elected, and the [[Keskusta|Agrarian]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] was elected.
* In 1994 the SFP's candidate [[Elisabeth Rehn]] was defeated by the Social Democrat candidate [[Martti Ahtisaari]], also with a narrow margin (53.9% to 46.1%).

SFP supports Finnish NATO memberships and envisions that Finland could become a full NATO member by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://yle.fi/uutiset/rkp_on_nyt_virallisesti_nato-puolue/8951589 |title= RKP on nyt virallisesti Nato-puolue |date= 12 June 2016 |accessdate= 12 June 2016 |publisher= Yle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
