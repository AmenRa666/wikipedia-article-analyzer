==History==
Buffalo’s original plan from the early 19th century was loosely based on [[Pierre Charles L’Enfant]]’s [[L'Enfant Plan|1791 plan]] for [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], an Americanized version of [[Paris]]’s system of radiating boulevards.  Buffalo’s radial street grid was designed by [[Joseph Ellicott]] and complemented by a system of parks and parkways designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. Buffalo was the first city for which Olmsted designed an interconnected park and parkway system rather than stand-alone parks.

[[File:Buffalo Panorama 2015.jpg|centre|thumb|1000px|Aerial view of Buffalo's skyline. At center is the [[Robert H. Jackson United States Courthouse]] and the [[Art Deco]] [[Buffalo City Hall]], with the [[Buffalo City Court Building]] to the right. On the far right is [[One Seneca Tower]], formerly the HSBC Building.]]

During the [[Centennial Exposition]] of 1876 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] declared Buffalo to be &quot;the best planned city, as to its streets, public places, and grounds, in the United States, if not in the world.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kowsky|first1=Francis|title=The Best Planned City in the World: Olmsted, Vaux, and the Buffalo Park System|date=June 2013|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=978-1-62534-006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'' architecture writer Nicolai Ourousoff:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] was founded on a rich tradition of architectural experimentation. The architects who worked here were among the first to break with European traditions to create an aesthetic of their own, rooted in American ideals about individualism, commerce and social mobility.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The city contains buildings designed by American architecture masters like [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Louis Sullivan]], and [[H.H. Richardson]], making Buffalo one of the most architecturally significant cities in America. It also contains many buildings designed by modern architects including [[Minoru Yamasaki]], [[Toshiko Mori]], and [[Harrison &amp; Abramovitz]].

===Albright–Knox Art Gallery===
{{main|Albright–Knox Art Gallery}}
[[File:Albright Knox Art Gallery Sculpture 2.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Karma&quot; by [[Do-ho Suh]] (2010) in front of [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]]]] The [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]] was designed in 1890 architect [[Edward Brodhead Green]] and funded by Buffalo entrepreneur and philanthropist, [[John J. Albright]], a wealthy [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] industrialist. It was originally intended to be used as the Fine Arts Pavilion for the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in 1901, but delays in its construction caused it to remain uncompleted until 1905. In 1962, a new addition was made to the gallery through the contributions of [[Seymour H. Knox II|Seymour H. Knox, Jr.]] and his family, and many other donors. At this time the museum was renamed the Albright–Knox Art Gallery. The new building was designed by [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] architect [[Gordon Bunshaft]], who is noted for the [[Lever House]] in New York City. The Albright–Knox Art Gallery is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

===Buffalo Central Terminal===
{{main|Buffalo Central Terminal}}

===Buffalo Main Light===
{{main|Buffalo Main Light}}
The [[Buffalo Main Light]], also known as ''The Buffalo Lighthouse'', is Buffalo's oldest building. It was built in 1833 and deactivated in 1914. It appears on the city seal at the mouth of the Buffalo River.  It is also one of the oldest lighthouses on the Great Lakes. The walls of the tapered, unpainted octagonal limestone tower are four feet thick at the base and rise to 44 feet in height. The foundation material was stone molehead and the lighthouse was constructed out of [[limestone]] and [[cast iron]].  The shape of the tower was octagonal and was {{convert|60|ft}}  high.  The lens installed in 1857 was a third order [[Fresnel lens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buildings &amp; Monuments|url=http://www.visitbuffaloniagara.com/business-type/buildings-monuments/|website=visitbuffaloniagara.com|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

===Delaware Park System===
{{main|Delaware Park–Front Park System}}
[[File:Delaware Park Casino.jpg|thumb|right|[[Delaware Park–Front Park System|Delaware Park Casino]]]] The [[Delaware Park–Front Park System|Delaware Park System]] is a historic [[park]] system and national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] located in the northern and western sections of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].  The park system was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]] and developed between 1868 and 1876. The Park System comprises many parks, Delaware Park being the largest (encompassing 376 acres).  There are also Gates Circle, Chapin Parkway, Soldier's Place, Lincoln Parkway, Bidwell Parkway, and Front Park, among others. The park system was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.

===Larkin Administration Building===
{{main|Larkin Administration Building}}
[[File:LarkinAdministrationBuilding1906.jpg|thumb|right|[[Larkin Administration Building]], 1906]] The [[Larkin Administration Building]] was [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s first commission in Buffalo. Larkin executive [[Darwin D. Martin]] hired Wright to design a building that would house the large number of clerks needed to operate the mail-order business for the [[Larkin Company|Larkin Soap Company]].  Because the building would be located in an industrial part of town, it was necessary to make the building as attractive as possible to women, who made up the bulk of the [[white-collar worker|white collar]] work force.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/flw/buildings/larkin/larkin.html PBS website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Larkin building was Wright's first commercial commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrastories.com/bearings/frank-lloyd-wright-and-his-forgotten-larkin-building Terra Stories]&lt;/ref&gt; and he designed not just the building, but also the furniture, light fixtures and the china for the workers' cafeteria.   Where possible, files and furniture were built into the structure, and he created desks with attached chairs that could swivel to save room. Wright included a pipe organ for lunchtime entertainment, a lending library and a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]] to allow employees to rest and commune with nature.  The [[Larkin Administration Building]] is significant for its comprehensive design, where every element performed a specific task, as well as being the first modern office building that separated [[blue-collar]] and [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] workers.

The Larkin Company went out of business in 1937, and the building was sold.  Eventually, the City of Buffalo took it over for back taxes planning to demolish it for a trucking plaza.  Despite community outcry, the building was torn down in 1950.

===Old Post Office===

[[File:20090412 Birge-Horton House.JPG|thumb|right|[[Birge-Horton House]], 2009]]
{{main article|Birge-Horton House}}
The [[Birge-Horton House]] was designed in 1895 by the Buffalo architectural firm of [[Edward Brodhead Green|Green and Wicks]] and is a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian Revival]] style row house in &quot;The Midway&quot; section of Delaware Avenue. It is a four story brick house with stone trim. The house is situated within the boundaries of the [[Allentown Historic District (Buffalo, New York)|Allentown Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=100572|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Birge--Horton House|date=January 26, 2004|accessdate=2009-06-14 |author=Claire L. Ross |publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}} ''See also:'' {{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=100521 |title=Accompanying four photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Birge-Horton House was the last of the thirteen luxury row houses built from 1893-1895. All were four-story houses and each house is the work of varying architects and of different designs, however, they give an overall appearance of unified composition because of similarities in height, width, and construction materials.

===Charles W. Goodyear House===
{{main article|Charles W. Goodyear House}}
The [[Charles W. Goodyear House]] was designed by [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] architect [[Edward Brodhead Green|Edward Green]], of the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] architecture firm Green &amp; Wicks, and was completed in 1903 at a cost of $500,000 ({{Inflation|US|500000|1903|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). The home was built for [[Charles W. Goodyear|Charles and Ella Goodyear]]. The house is located in the [[Delaware Avenue Historic District (Buffalo, New York)|Delaware Avenue Historic District]], a federally designated [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1974. The exterior of the two and a half story house is brick trimmed with stone. The [[mansard roof]] includes a row of [[dormer]]s with [[pediment]]ed tops with a [[festoon]]ed motif that runs along the roofline above a dentilled cornice. The principal entrance is on the north (right) side of the house denoted by a large arched doorway, bordered on each side by stone [[urn]]s. The east façade facing Delaware Avenue has a one story porch with columns, that was later bricked in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delaware Avenue Historic District|url=http://www.livingplaces.com/NY/Erie_County/Buffalo_City/Delaware_Avenue_Historic_District.html|website=livingplaces.com|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin D. Martin House===
[[File:Darwin D Martin House, Buffalo, NY.jpg|thumb|right|[[Darwin D. Martin House]], 2012]]{{main article|Darwin D. Martin House}}
The [[Darwin D. Martin House]] was designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and built between 1903 and 1905 for [[Darwin D. Martin]], an executive of the [[Larkin Soap Company]]. Martin chose Wright to design his own house because he was so impressed with Wright and his design for the [[Larkin Administration Building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darwinmartinhouse.org/ Darwin D. Martin House website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Martin House is considered to be one of the most important projects from Wright's [[Prairie School]] era. Compared to other Prairie Houses, the Martin House is unusually large and has an open plan containing fifteen distinctive patterns of nearly 400 [[art glass]] windows, designed by Wright, some of which contain over 750 individual pieces of iridescent glass, that act as light screens to connect exterior views to the spaces within. More patterns of art glass were designed for the house than for any other of Wright's Prairie Houses.  It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on February 24, 1986 and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]], also on February 24, 1986.

===Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site===
{{main article|Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site}}
The [[Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site]], also known as the ''Ansley Wilcox House'', at 641 Delaware Avenue was built in 1840 by George Cary (U.S. Army) originally intended as the Barrack's officer's quarters. After the post was disbanded in 1845, the home reverted to a private residence.  Subsequent owners continued to modify the structure adding and demolishing out structures and additions.  In the late 19th century, Dexter Rumsey gave the property to his son-in-law [[Ansley Wilcox]] and his wife Mary Grace Rumsey.  The newest inhabitants made extensive renovations to the structure.

In 1901, while attending the [[Pan-American Exposition]], anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]] shot President [[William McKinley]]. [[Vice-President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] rushed back to Buffalo, but arrived only after McKinley had died.  Due to the tragic and politically charged circumstances of the President's death, the inauguration was held immediately, and the most appropriate site was determined to be the Wilcox home.  Approximately 50 dignitaries, family members and cabinet officials gathered in the front library for the inauguration and Federal Judge [[John R. Hazel]] administered the oath.  The Wilcoxes continued to live in the home until their deaths in the 1930s. The [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]] was authorized on November 2, 1966.  As a historic area administered by the [[National Park Service]], it was automatically listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] the same day.

===William Dorsheimer House===
{{main article|William Dorsheimer House}}
The [[William Dorsheimer House]] was designed and built in 1868 by [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] (1838–1886) for [[William Dorsheimer]] (1832–1888), a prominent local lawyer and [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]]. It is located on Delaware Avenue in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and is a two-and-a-half-story brick dwelling. It represents the profound influence of French ideas on the arts in the post [[American Civil War|Civil War]] period.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=2251|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: William Dorsheimer House|date=April 10, 1980|accessdate=2009-06-14 |author=Francis Kowsky |publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}} ''See also:'' {{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=2250 |title=Accompanying seven photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.

===William R. Heath House===
{{main article|William R. Heath House}}
The [[William R. Heath House]] was designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], built in 1904–1905, and is located at 76 [[Delaware Park-Front Park System|Soldiers Place]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. It is built in the [[Prairie School]] architectural style.  William Heath was a lawyer who served as office manager, and eventually vice-president, of the [[Larkin Company]] in Buffalo.&lt;ref name=&quot;buffarch&quot; &gt;Reyner Banham &amp; Francis R. Kowsky, ''Buffalo Architecture'', p.163-164, Buffalo Architectural Guidebook Corporation; 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Heath's wife Mary was a sister of [[Elbert Hubbard]], a former Larkin executive.&lt;ref name=&quot;buffarch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tafel2&quot; &gt;Edgar Tafel, ''Years with Frank Lloyd Wright: Apprentice to Genius'', p.84, Courier Dover Publications; 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  The property was a deep and narrow corner lot, facing a large [[traffic circle]]. This presented Wright with the problem of situating a substantial Prairie house, with its characteristically open structure, in a confined space with twice the street exposure.  The house was placed with its long axis right up against the Bird Ave. sidewalk with sections of the traffic circle acting as the grounds that a house of this standing would normally possess.&lt;ref name=&quot;gill&quot; &gt;Brendan Gill, ''Many Masks'', p.145-146, Da Capo Press; 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
