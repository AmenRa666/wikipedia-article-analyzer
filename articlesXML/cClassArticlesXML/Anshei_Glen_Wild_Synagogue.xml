'''Anshei Glen Wild Synagogue''' is located on Glen Wild Road, [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]] Route 58, in the [[unincorporated community]] of [[Thompson, New York|Glen Wild]], New York, United States. It is a small [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[synagogue]] built in the early 1920s for a congregation established during the previous decade.

It was founded by a local family and has never had its own [[rabbi]]. The synagogue is preserved virtually intact from the time of its construction and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1999.

==Building==

The synagogue is a single-story three-by-four-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] building on a concrete [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] with [[stucco]] siding and a [[gable]]d roof [[roof shingle|shingled]] in asphalt. A four-bay addition projects from the rear. The west (front) [[facade]] features a porch with bell-shaped roof supported by two round wooden columns rising from a concrete stoop. The porch's [[entablature]] features the name of the synagogue and a [[Star of David]]. Both sides and the original rear wall feature large round-arched windows with colored and opaque glass.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRHP nom&quot; /&gt;

The ornately paneled wooden doors, surmounted by a colored [[fanlight]], open onto a small [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]]. The remainder of the original block is used for the [[sanctuary]], a barrel-vaulted square room. A [[chandelier]] hangs from the intersection of two iron [[tie rod]]s at the bottom of the vault. The floor layout of the sanctuary follows Orthodox tradition, with the centrally-located [[bimah]] surrounded by [[pew]]s with curved end panels on three sides, all of which face the [[Torah ark]] at the rear. Two or three have been set aside as the women's gallery.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRHP nom&quot; /&gt;

[[Turning (woodworking)|Turned]] wooden posts on the elaborately decorated ark support a [[pediment]]ed roof, where two [[woodcarving|carved]], [[Gilding|gilt]] [[Lion of Judah|Lions of Judah]] hold a scroll with the [[Ten Commandments]] topped by a large gilt crown. Both the ark platform and bimah are made of paneled wood with square posts.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRHP nom&quot; /&gt;

==History==

As in other areas of Sullivan County, Jews began coming to the region, first to vacation and later to stay, around the turn of the 20th century. Among the early arrivals to the Glen Wild area, in 1904, were Simon Jaffe and his family, [[Lithuanian Jews|of Lithuanian descent]] like other Jews in the area. Since he had been a ''[[Shechita|shochet]]'', or ritual animal slaughterer, he helped establish the small congregation, of 13 members at first, in 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRHP nom&quot; /&gt;

Worshippers met in his house for over a decade before they began to talk about building a synagogue. A small parcel of land was acquired, and [[cornerstone]]s were laid in 1921. Local [[General contractor|contractor]] Jim Couch and Sons, neighbors of the Jaffes, handled the construction. The finished building, completed in 1923, reflects some characteristics of Sullivan County's Christian churches such as the gabled roof, but the window treatments and stucco finish link it to other synagogues of the period in the area, such as [[Hebrew Congregation of Mountaindale Synagogue|Hebrew Congregation of Mountaindale]] and [[South Fallsburg Hebrew Association Synagogue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NRHP nom&quot; /&gt;

In 1955 a congregant, Louis Rosenblatt, donated money for the construction of the rear wing, to be used as a social hall. This has been the only change made to the building since 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRHP nom&quot; /&gt;

Since Anshei Glen Wild was a small congregation, it never hired its own [[rabbi]]. Simon Jaffe, a schoolteacher, conducted services and taught congregants' children [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. His family continues to maintain the synagogue, although services are infrequent. The two dozen members focus much of their efforts on maintaining the nearby cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT story&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rozhon|first=Tracie|title=Borscht Belt's Spiritual Survivors; Resilient Catskill Synagogues Enter Historic Register|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/16/nyregion/borscht-belt-s-spiritual-survivors-resilient-catskill-synagogues-enter-historic.html|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=2|date=August 16, 1998|accessdate=April 29, 2009|quote=Although the Anshei Glen Wild synagogue has not had any services this summer, it has two dozen members who pay for its upkeep â€” and a cemetery.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
