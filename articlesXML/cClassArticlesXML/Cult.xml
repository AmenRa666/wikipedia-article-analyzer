The term '''Cult''' usually refers to a [[social group]] defined by their [[religion|religious]] beliefs. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study.&lt;ref name=ZablockiRobbins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson/&gt; In the [[Sociological classifications of religious movements#Cult typology|sociological classifications of religious movements]], a cult is a social group with [[Deviance (sociology)|socially deviant]] or [[Novelty|novel]] beliefs and practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stark |first1=Rodney |last2=Bainbridge |first2=William Sims |title=A Theory of Religion |year=1996 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=0-8135-2330-3 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is often unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], citing ''American Journal of Sociology'' 85 (1980), p. 1377: &quot;Cults[...], like other deviant social movements, tend to recruit people with a grievance, people who suffer from a some variety of deprivation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Chuck Shaw – [http://shawcss.tripod.com/REL101/society/sects.htm Sects and Cults] – Greenville Technical College – Retrieved 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Paul J. 2006. &quot;The Public Perception of 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements'.&quot; Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 45 (1): 97–106&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;cult&quot; has always been controversial because it is (in a [[pejorative]] sense) considered a subjective term, used as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Chuck Shaw - [http://shawcss.tripod.com/REL101/society/sects.htm Sects and Cults] - Greenville Technical College - Retrieved 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David Melton, J. Gordon 2002. Cults, Religion, and Violence. West Nyack, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker1999&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in the 1930s, cults became the object of [[sociology|sociological study]] in the context of the study of religious behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley – [https://books.google.com/books?id=C5V7oyy69zgC&amp;pg=PA897&amp;lpg=PA897&amp;dq=howard+becker+cult+study&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en The Encyclopedia of Christianity: P-Sh, Volume 4] page 897. Retrieved 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1940s the [[Christian countercult movement]] has opposed some [[sect]]s and [[new religious movement]], and labelled them as cults for their &quot;un-Christian&quot; [[Heterodoxy|unorthodox beliefs]]. The secular [[anti-cult movement]]  began in the 1970s and opposed certain groups, often charging them with [[mind control]] and partly motivated in reaction to acts of violence committed by some of their members. Some of the claims and actions of the anti-cult movements have been disputed by scholars and by the news media, leading to further public controversy. 

The term &quot;new religious movement&quot; refers to religions which have appeared since the mid-1800s.  Many, but not all, have been considered to be cults. Sub-categories of cults include: [[Doomsday cult]]s, [[Politics|political]] cults, destructive cults, [[racist]] cults, [[polygamist]] cults, and [[terrorist]] cults.	Governmental reactions to  cult-related issues have also been a source of controversy. 

==Terminological history==

[[File:Church-sect continuum.svg|right|thumb|400px|[[Howard P. Becker]]'s church-sect typology, based on [[Ernst Troeltsch]] original theory and upon which the modern concept of cults, sects, and new religious movements is based.]]
The word &quot;cult&quot; was originally used not to describe a group of religionists, but for the act of [[worship]] or religious ceremony. It was first used in the early 17th century, borrowed via the [[French language|French]] ''culte, ''from [[Latin]] ''cultus'' (worship). This, in turn, was derived from the adjective ''cultus'' (inhabited, cultivated, worshiped), based on the verb ''colere'' (care, cultivate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cult|title=Definition of CULT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;culture&quot; is also derived from the Latin words ''cultura'' and ''cultus'', which in general terms refers to the customary beliefs, social forms and material traits of a religious or social group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture culture] - Merriam-Webster. Retrieved 25 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the literal sense of the word in English is still in use, a derived sense of &quot;excessive devotion&quot; arose in the 19th century. The terms ''cult'' and ''cultist'' came to be used in [[medical literature]] in the United States in the 1930s for what would now be termed [[faith healing]], especially for the US [[Holiness movement]]. This experienced a surge of popularity at the time, but extended to other forms of [[alternative medicine]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;In W. S. Taylor, 'Science and cult', ''Psychological Review'', Vol 37(2), March 1930, ''cultist'' is still used in the sense that would now be expressed by &quot;religionist&quot;, i.e. anyone adopting a religious worldview as opposed to a scientific one. In the ''New York State Journal of Medicine'' of 1932, p. 84 (and other medical publications of the 1930s; e.g. Morris Fishbein, ''Fads and Quackery in Healing: An Analysis of the Foibles of the Healing Cults'', 1932), &quot;cultist&quot; is used of those adhering to what was then called &quot;healing cults&quot;, and would now be referred to as [[faith healing]], but also of other forms of [[alternative medicine]] (&quot;cultist&quot; (in quotes) of a [[chiropractor]] in 
''United States naval medical bulletin'', Volume 28, 1930, p. 366).
&lt;/ref&gt;  In the English speaking world, the word often carries derogatory connotations, but in other European languages, it is used as English-speakers use the word &quot;religion&quot;, sometimes causing confusion for English-speakers reading material translated from other languages.&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. &quot;Unit 13: Social Psychology&quot;. pp 320 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH13.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1930s, the [[Christian countercult movement]] began applying the term ''cult'' to what would formerly have been termed [[heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;
''The Chaos of Cults'', by J.K.van Baalen, 1938, 2nd revised and enlarged ed. [https://archive.org/stream/chaosofcultsastu009445mbp#page/n5/mode/2up 1956].
&quot;cult&quot; in the sense of &quot;heresy&quot; is also found in J.Oswald Sanders, ''Heresies Ancient and Modern'' (1948).
&lt;/ref&gt; This usage became mainstream by the 1960s, via the best-selling ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (1965). This terminological development, which had so far been characteristic of the [[Religion in the United States|religious sociology of the United States]], entered international use with the [[Satanic ritual abuse|&quot;ritual abuse&quot; moral panic]] of the 1980s, which originated in the United States. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the [[Satanic ritual abuse#International spread|international spread]] throughout most of the [[Anglosphere]] and some parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;A [[European Federation of Centres of Research and Information on Sectarianism]] was set up in 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also from the 1990s, as part of the [[political correctness|discrimination discourse]] at the height of the [[Culture war#United States of America|US &quot;culture war&quot;]], [[Neopaganism in the United States|US neopagan]] religions, especially [[Wicca]], began to protest through literature their classification as cults as [[discrimination against Neopagans|discriminatory]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This book tells you why the propaganda about and misrepresentation of Witches as evil, Satan-worshipping cultists is absolutely false&quot; Scott Cunningham, ''The Truth about Witchcraft'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this usage of &quot;cult&quot; began to be discouraged in favour of the neutral [[new religious movement]] in sociological literature.&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Olson, The Public Perception of “Cults” and “New Religious Movements” Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion; Mar2006, Vol. 45 Issue 1, 97-106&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of such an approach have sometimes been denounced as &quot;procult apologists&quot; by members of the anti-cult movement.&lt;ref&gt;so Margaret Singer, Janja Lalich, ''[[Cults in Our Midst]]'' (1995), in reference to [[Eileen Barker]].
See also Tim Stafford, &quot;The Kingdom of the Cult Watchers&quot;, Christianity Today (October 7, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most sociologists and scholars of religion also began to reject the word &quot;cult&quot; altogether because of its negative connotations in mass culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawson |first=Lorne L. |title=Comprehending Cults: The Sociology of New Religious Movements |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-542009-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some began to advocate the use of new terms like &quot;new religious movement&quot;, &quot;alternative religion&quot; or &quot;novel religion&quot; to describe most of the groups that had come to be referred to as &quot;cults&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2006.00007.x |author=Goldman, Marion |year=2006 |title=Review Essay: Cults, New Religions, and the Spiritual Landscape: A Review of Four Collections |journal=Journal of the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=87–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet none of these terms have had much success in popular culture or in the media. Other scholars have pushed to redeem the word &quot;cult&quot; as one fit for neutral academic discourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bainbridge1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Bainbridge, William Sims |title=The Sociology of Religious Movements |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1997 |page=24 |isbn=0-415-91202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey study containing 258 participants, negative perceptions of the terms &quot;new religious movement&quot;, &quot;cult&quot; and &quot;satanic cult&quot; were found. However, these terms differed significantly (i.e., not due to chance) in how negatively the participants perceived them. &quot;New religious movement&quot; was found to be the most favourable term, followed by &quot;cult&quot; and then &quot;Satanic cult&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogloff92&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ogloff|first=J. R.|author2=Pfeifer, J.

==Scholarly studies==
[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Max Weber]] (1864–1920), one of the first scholars to study cults.]]
Sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) found that cults based on [[charisma]]tic leadership often follow the [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization of charisma]].&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Maximillan. ''Theory of Social and Economic Organization.'' Chapter: &quot;The Nature of Charismatic Authority and its Routinization&quot; translated by A. R. Anderson and [[Talcott Parsons]], 1947. Originally published in 1922 in German under the title [http://www.textlog.de/7415.html ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft'' chapter III, § 10] (available online)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of a &quot;cult&quot; as a [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|sociological classification]] was introduced in 1932 by American sociologist [[Howard P. Becker]] as an expansion of German theologian [[Ernst Troeltsch]]'s [[Sociological classifications of religious movements#Sociological Church-Sect typology|church-sect typology]]. Troeltsch's aim was to distinguish between three main types of religious behavior: churchly, [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] and [[Mysticism|mystical]]. Becker created four categories out of Troeltsch's first two by splitting ''church'' into &quot;[[Christian Church|ecclesia]]&quot; and &quot;[[Religious denomination|denomination]]&quot;, and ''sect'' into &quot;[[sect]]&quot; and &quot;cult&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SwatosEncy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Church-Sect Theory |last=Swatos |first=William H. Jr. |year=1998 |pages=90–93 |title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society |editor=William H. Swatos Jr. |publisher=AltaMira |location=Walnut Creek, CA |isbn=978-0-7619-8956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Troeltsch's &quot;mystical religion&quot;, Becker's cults were small religious groups lacking in organization and emphasizing the private nature of personal beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CampbellEncy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Cult |last=Campbell |first=Colin |year=1998 |pages=122–123 |title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society |editor=William H. Swatos Jr. |publisher=AltaMira |location=Walnut Creek, CA |isbn=978-0-7619-8956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later sociological formulations built on these characteristics, placing an additional emphasis on cults as [[deviant]] religious groups &quot;deriving their inspiration from outside of the predominant religious culture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Richardson93|Richardson]], 1993 p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; This is often thought to lead to a high degree of tension between the group and the more mainstream culture surrounding it, a characteristic shared with religious sects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#StarkBainbridge|Stark and Bainbridge]], 1987 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In this sociological terminology, ''sects'' are products of religious [[schism (religion)|schism]] and therefore maintain a continuity with [[tradition]]al beliefs and practices, while ''cults'' arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#StarkBainbridge|Stark and Bainbridge]], 1987 p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with [[South Korean]] [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and some of the first American [[Unification Church]] members in [[California]], during which he studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uc-history.us/GalenHistory/Forward.htm The Early Unification Church History], Galen Pumphrey&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion], [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church], ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: &quot;The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes&quot;, and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith|Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

Sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] (1945–1990) argued that a cult is characterized by &quot;[[epistemology|epistemological]] individualism&quot;, meaning that &quot;the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member&quot;. Cults, according to Wallis, are generally described as &quot;oriented towards the problems of individuals, loosely structured, tolerant [and] non-exclusive&quot;, making &quot;few demands on members&quot;, without possessing a &quot;clear distinction between members and non-members&quot;, having &quot;a rapid turnover of membership&quot; and as being transient collectives with vague boundaries and fluctuating belief systems. Wallis asserts that cults emerge from the &quot;cultic milieu&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy ''Scientology: Therapeutic Cult to Religious Sect'' [http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/1/89 abstract only] (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Bruce Campbell noted that cults are associated with beliefs in a [[divine]] [[element]] in the [[individual]]. It is either [[Soul]], [[Self]], or [[True Self]].  Cults are inherently ephemeral and loosely organized. There is a major theme in many of the recent works that show the relationship between cults and [[mysticism]].  Campbell brings two major types of cults to attention. One is mystical and the other is instrumental.  This can divide the cults into being either [[occult]] or [[metaphysical]] assemblies. On the basis that Campbell proposes about cults, they are non-traditional religious groups based on belief in a divine element in the individual.  There is also a third type.  This is service-oriented. Campbell states that &quot;the kinds of stable forms which evolve in the development of religious organization will bear a significant relationship to the content of the religious experience of the founder or founders.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce Campbell 1978&quot;&gt;Bruce Campbell (1978). &quot;A Typology of Cults.&quot; ''Sociology Analysis'', Santa Barbara&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1996 book ''Theory of Religion'', American sociologists [[Rodney Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge]] propose that the formation of cults can be explained through the [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stark1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Rodney |last1=Stark |first2=William |last2=Bainbridge |authorlink1=Rodney Stark |authorlink2=William Sims Bainbridge |title=A Theory of Religion |publisher=Peter Lang Publishing |year=1996 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xi9j4vCOtPQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#PPA155,M1 155] |isbn=0-8135-2330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Future of Religion'' they comment &quot;...in the beginning, all religions are obscure, tiny, deviant cult movements&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene V.

Stark and Bainbridge, in discussing the process by which individuals join new religious groups, have even questioned the utility of the concept of ''conversion'', suggesting that ''affiliation'' is a more useful concept.&lt;ref&gt;Bader, Chris &amp; A. Demaris, ''A test of the Stark-Bainbridge theory of affiliation with religious cults and sects.'' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 35, 285–303. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-cult movements==

===Christian countercult movement===
{{Main article|Christian countercult movement}}
[[File:Walter Ralston Martin ca 1983.png|thumb|250px|[[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] (1928–1989), American author and leading figure in the [[Christian countercult movement]].]]

In the 1940s, the long held opposition by some established Christian denominations to non-Christian religions and/or supposedly [[heresy|heretical]], or counterfeit, Christian sects crystallized into a more organized [[Christian countercult movement]] in the United States. For those belonging to the movement, all religious groups claiming to be Christian, but deemed outside of Christian [[orthodoxy]], were considered cults.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cowan2003|Cowan]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Christian cults are new religious movements which have a Christian background but are considered to be [[Theology|theologically]] deviant by members of other Christian churches.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]], ''Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America'' (New York/London: Garland, 1986; revised edition, Garland, 1992). page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In his influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (first published in the United States in 1965), Christian scholar [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] defines Christian cults as groups that follow the personal interpretation of an individual, rather than the understanding of the [[Bible]] accepted by [[mainstream Christianity]]. He mentions [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Christian Science]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], and [[Unity Church|Unity]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ralston Martin, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', Bethany House, 2003, ISBN 0-7642-2821-8 page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian countercult movement asserts that Christian sects whose beliefs are partially or wholly not in accordance with the [[Bible]] are erroneous. It also states that a religious sect can be considered a cult if its beliefs involve a denial of what they view as any of the essential [[Christian]] teachings such as [[salvation]], the [[Trinity]], [[Jesus]] himself as a person, the [[ministry of Jesus]], the [[Miracles of Jesus]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], the [[Death of Christ]], the [[Resurrection of Christ]], the [[Second Coming of Christ]], and the [[Rapture]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter R.

===Secular anti-cult movement===
{{Main article|Anti-cult movement}}
In the early 1970s, a secular opposition movement to groups considered cults had taken shape. The organizations that formed the secular &quot;[[anti-cult movement]]&quot; (ACM) often acted on behalf of relatives of &quot;cult&quot; [[religious conversion|converts]] who did not believe their loved ones could have altered their lives so drastically by their own free will. A few [[psychologist]]s and sociologists working in this field suggested that [[brainwashing]] techniques were used to maintain the loyalty of cult members,&lt;ref name=&quot;refRichardsonIntrovigne&quot;&gt;[[#RichardsonIntrovigne|Richardson and Introvigne]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; while others rejected the idea. The belief that cults brainwashed their members became a unifying theme among cult critics and in the more extreme corners of the anti-cult movement techniques like the sometimes forceful &quot;[[deprogramming]]&quot; of cult members was practiced.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShupeEncy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Anti-Cult Movement |last=Shupe |first=Anson |year=1998 |page=27 |title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society |editor=William H.

Secular cult opponents belonging to the anti-cult movement usually define a &quot;cult&quot; as a group that tends to manipulate, exploit, and control its members. Specific factors in cult behavior are said to include manipulative and authoritarian [[mind control]] over members, [[Commune|communal]] and totalistic organization, aggressive [[proselytizing]], systematic programs of [[indoctrination]], and perpetuation in [[middle-class]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;T. Robbins and D. Anthony (1982:283, quoted in Richardson 1993:351) (&quot;...certain manipulative and authoritarian groups which allegedly employ mind control and pose a threat to mental health are universally labeled cults. These groups are usually 1) authoritarian in their leadership; 2)communal and totalistic in their organization; 3) aggressive in their proselytizing; 4) systematic in their programs of indoctrination; 5)relatively new and unfamiliar in the United States; 6)middle class in their clientele&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=J.

&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mass media, and among average citizens, &quot;cult&quot; gained an increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like [[kidnapping]], [[brainwashing]], [[psychological abuse]], [[sexual abuse]] and other [[crime|criminal activity]], and [[mass suicide]]. While most of these negative qualities usually have real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law abiding it may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3512241|title=Cults and Sects and Doomsday Groups, Oh My: Media Treatment of Religion on the Eve of the Millennium|author=Hill, Harvey, John Hickman and Joel McLendon|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume=43|issue=1|year=2001|pages=24–38|jstor=3512241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3711011|author1=van Driel, Barend  |author2=J.

===Reactions to the anti-cult movements===

Because of the increasingly pejorative use of the words &quot;cult&quot; and &quot;cult leader&quot; since the cult debate of the 1970s, some academics, in addition to groups referred to as cults, argue that these are words to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;''Pilgrims of Love: The Anthropology of a Global Sufi Cult. By [[Pnina Werbner]]. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003. xvi, 348 pp'' &quot;...the excessive use of &quot;cult&quot; is also potentially misleading. With its pejorative connotations&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Definitions of Cult: From Sociological-Technical to Popular-Negative, James T. Richardson, Review of Religious Research, Vol. 34, No. 4 (Jun. 1993), pp. 348–356'' &quot;the word cult is useless, and should be avoided because of the confusion between the historic meaning of the word and current pejorative use&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Catherine Wessinger]] ([[Loyola University New Orleans]]) has stated that the word &quot;cult&quot; represents just as much prejudice and antagonism as racial slurs or derogatory words for women and homosexuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wessinger&quot; /&gt; She has argued that it is important for people to become aware of the bigotry conveyed by the word, drawing attention to the way it dehumanises the group's members and their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wessinger&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labeling a group as subhuman, she says, becomes a justification for violence against it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wessinger&quot; /&gt;  She also says that labeling a group a &quot;cult&quot; makes people feel safe, because the &quot;violence associated with religion is split off from conventional religions, projected onto others, and imagined to involve only aberrant groups&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wessinger&quot; /&gt; This fails to take into account that child abuse, sexual abuse, financial extortion and warfare have also been committed by believers of mainstream religions, but the pejorative &quot;cult&quot; stereotype makes it easier to avoid confronting this uncomfortable fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wessinger&quot; /&gt;

Sociologist Amy Ryan has argued for the need to differentiate those groups that may be dangerous from groups that are more benign.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Ryan: ''New Religions and the Anti-Cult Movement: Online Resource Guide in Social Sciences'' (2000) [http://rand.pratt.edu/~giannini/newreligions.html#Definitions]&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan notes the sharp differences between definition from cult opponents, who tend to focus on negative characteristics, and those of sociologists, who aim to create definitions that are value-free. The movements themselves may have different definitions of religion as well. [[George Chryssides]] also cites a need to develop better definitions to allow for common ground in the debate. In ''Defining Religion in American Law'', Bruce J. Casino presents the issue as crucial to international human rights laws. Limiting the definition of religion may interfere with freedom of religion, while too broad a definition may give some dangerous or abusive groups &quot;a limitless excuse for avoiding all unwanted legal obligations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casino-DefiningReligion&quot;&gt;[http://www.religiousfreedom.com/articles/casino.htm Casino.

==New religious movements==
{{main article|New religious movement}}
A new religious movement (NRM) is a religious community or spiritual group of modern origins (since the mid-1800s), which has a peripheral place within its society's dominant religious culture. NRMs can be novel in origin or part of a wider religion, in which case they are distinct from pre-existing [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke, Peter B 2006&quot;&gt;Clarke, Peter B. 2006.

The great majority have only a few members, some have thousands and only very few have more than a million.&lt;ref name=&quot;barker1999&quot;&gt;[[Eileen Barker]], 1999, &quot;New Religious Movements: their incidence and significance&quot;, ''New Religious Movements: challenge and response'', Bryan Wilson and Jamie Cresswell editors, [[Routledge]] ISBN 0-415-20050-4&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, religious scholar Elijah Siegler commented that, although no NRM had become the dominant faith in any country, many of the concepts which they had first introduced (often referred to as &quot;[[New Age]]&quot; ideas) have become part of worldwide mainstream culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elijah Siegler]], 2007, ''New Religious Movements'', [[Prentice Hall]], ISBN 0-13-183478-9, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doomsday cults==
{{Main article|Doomsday cult}}
&quot;Doomsday cult&quot; is an expression used to describe groups who believe in [[Apocalypticism]] and [[Millenarianism]], and can refer both to groups that prophesy [[Disaster|catastrophe]] and destruction, and to those that attempt to bring it about.&lt;ref name=&quot;jenkins&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Phillip |title=Mystics and Messiahs: Cults and New Religions in American History |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] [[United States|USA]] |year=2000 |pages=216, 222 |id= |isbn=0-19-514596-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1997 psychological study by Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter found that people turned to a cataclysmic [[world view]] after they had repeatedly failed to find meaning in mainstream movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;pargament&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pargament |first=Kenneth I. |author-link=Kenneth Pargament |title=The Psychology of Religion and Coping: Theory, Research, Practice |publisher=Guilford Press |year=1997 |pages=150–153, 340, section: &quot;Compelling Coping in a Doomsday Cult&quot; |id= |isbn=1-57230-664-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Festinger]] and his colleagues had observed members of a small [[UFO religion]] called the [[When Prophecy Fails|Seekers]] for several months, and recorded their conversations both prior to and after a failed prophecy from their charismatic leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;stangor&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Stangor |first=Charles |title=Social Groups in Action and Interaction |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004 |pages=42–43: &quot;When Prophecy Fails&quot; |id= |isbn=1-84169-407-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Dr. David M. |title=Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life |publisher=Pine Forge Press |year=2006 |id= |isbn=1-4129-2814-1 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;petty&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Petty |first=Richard E. |author2=John T.

==Political cults==
[[File:EAP demonstrerar mot EU - 2008-05-01 - 1.jpg|thumb|[[LaRouche Movement]] members in [[Stockholm]] protesting the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].]]
A political cult is a cult with a primary interest in [[Politics|political action]] and [[ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Tourish and [[Tim Wohlforth]], ''[[On the Edge (book)|On the Edge: Political Cults Right and Left]]'', Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janja Lalich &quot;On the Edge&quot; (review), Cultic Studies Review (online journal), 2:2, 2003 [http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_bookreviews/bkrev_onedgeandtabernaclehate.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Groups that some writers have termed as &quot;political cults&quot;, mostly advocating [[Left-wing politics|far-left]] or [[Right-wing politics|far-right]] agendas, have received some attention from journalists and scholars. In their 2000 book ''[[On the Edge (book)|On the Edge: Political Cults Right and Left]]'', Dennis Tourish and [[Tim Wohlforth]] discuss about a dozen organizations in the United States and Great Britain that they characterize as cults.&lt;ref&gt;Tourish and Wohlforth, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate article Tourish says that in his usage: &lt;blockquote&gt;The word cult is not a term of abuse, as this paper tries to explain. It is nothing more than a shorthand expression for a particular set of practices that have been observed in a variety of dysfunctional organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext27/Intro.html Introduction to ‘Ideological Intransigence, Democratic Centralism and Cultism’&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the Collective advocated an individualist philosophy, Rothbard claimed they were organized in the manner of a &quot;Leninist&quot; organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;rothbard&quot; /&gt;

In Britain, the [[Workers Revolutionary Party (UK)|Workers Revolutionary Party]], a [[Trotskyist]] group led by the late [[Gerry Healy]] and strongly supported by actress [[Vanessa Redgrave]], has been described by others, who have been involved in the Trotskyist movement, as having been a cult or as displaying cult-like characteristics in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;David North, ''Gerry Healy and His Place in the History of the Fourth International'', Mehring Books, 1991. ISBN 0-929087-58-5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also described as such by Tourish and Wohlforth in their writings.&lt;ref&gt;Tourish and Wohlforth, &quot;Gerry Healy: Guru to a Star&quot; (Chapter 10), pp. 156–172, in ''On the Edge: Political Cults Right and Left'', Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of Tourish and Wohlforth's book, Bob Pitt, a former member of the WRP concedes that it had a &quot;cult-like character&quot; but argues that rather than being typical of the far left, this feature actually made the WRP atypical and &quot;led to its being treated as a pariah within the revolutionary left itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt&quot;&gt;&quot;Cults, Sects and the Far Left&quot; reviewed by Bob Pitt, ''What Next?'' {{ISSN|1479-4322}} No. 17, 2000 [http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages//Back/Wnext17/Reviews.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Workers' Struggle]] (LO, ''Lutte ouvrière'') in France, publicly headed by [[Arlette Laguiller]] but revealed in the 1990s to be directed by [[Robert Barcia]], has often been criticized as a cult, for example by [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] and his older brother Gabriel Cohn-Bendit, as well as ''[[L'Humanité]]'' and ''[[Libération]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arlette Laguiller n'aime pas le débat |date=11 April 2002 |publisher=[[L'Humanité]] |url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2002-04-11/2002-04-11-32049 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Les Sectes Politiques: 1965–1995'' (translation: ''Political cults: 1965–1995''), French writer Cyril Le Tallec considered some religious groups as cults involved in politics, including the [[League for Catholic Counter-Reformation]], the [[Cultural Office of Cluny]], [[New Acropolis]], [[Sōka Gakkai]], the [[Divine Light Mission]], [[American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property|Tradition Family Property (TFP)]], Longo-Mai, the Supermen Club and the Association for Promotion of the Industrial Arts (Solazaref).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cyril Le Tallec |title=Les sectes politiques: 1965–1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-l1QQOEQKXUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22les+sectes+politiques%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |language=French |year=2006 |accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Lucy Patrick commented: &quot;Although we live in a democracy, cult behavior manifests itself in our unwillingness to question the judgment of our leaders, our tendency to devalue outsiders and to avoid dissent. We can overcome cult behavior, he says, by recognizing that we have dependency needs that are inappropriate for mature people, by increasing anti-authoritarian education, and by encouraging personal autonomy and the free exchange of ideas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Library Journal]] Dec 1990 v115 n21 p144(1) Mag.Coll.: 58A2543.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destructive cults==
[[File:Jim Jones in front of the International Hotel.jpg|thumb|riight|[[Jim Jones]] the leader of the [[People's Temple]]]]
&quot;Destructive cult&quot; has generally referred to groups whose members have, through deliberate action, physically injured or killed other members of their own group or other people. The [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] limit use of the term to specifically refer to religious groups that &quot;have caused or are liable to cause loss of life among their membership or the general public&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=B.A. |title=Doomsday, destructive religious cults |work=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |publisher= |date=&lt;!-- last updated --&gt;25 July 2007 |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/destruct.htm |doi= |accessdate=18 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychologist]] [[Michael Langone]], executive director of the anti-cult group [[International Cultic Studies Association]], defines a destructive cult as &quot;a highly manipulative group which exploits and sometimes physically and/or psychologically damages members and recruits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Francis J. |authorlink= |author2=Arnold Shanon Bloch, Ron Shor |title=Differential Diagnosis &amp; Treatment in Social Work |edition=4th |publisher=Free Press |date=1 September 1995 |location= |pages=1146: Chapter 105: &quot;From Consultation to Therapy in Group Work With Parents of Cultists&quot; |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=0-02-874007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of [[Benjamin Zablocki]], a Professor of Sociology at [[Rutgers University]], destructive cults are at high risk of becoming abusive to members. He states that this is in part due to members' adulation of [[charismatic authority|charismatic]] leaders contributing to the leaders becoming corrupted by power.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Zablocki, Benjamin [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~zablocki/] Paper presented to a conference, ''Cults: Theory and Treatment Issues'', 31 May 1997 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barrett, the most common accusation made against destructive cults is [[sexual abuse]]. According to [[Reender Kranenborg|Kranenborg]], some groups are risky when they advise their members not to use regular medical care.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kranenborg-1996&quot;&gt;Kranenborg, Reender Dr. (Dutch language) ''Sekten... gevaarlijk of niet?/Cults... dangerous or not?'' published in the magazine ''Religieuze bewegingen in Nederland/Religious movements in the Netherlands'' nr. 31 ''Sekten II'' by the [[Vrije Universiteit|Free university Amsterdam]] (1996) ISSN 0169-7374 ISBN 90-5383-426-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have criticized the usage of the term &quot;destructive cult&quot;, writing that it is used to describe groups which are not necessarily harmful in nature to themselves or others. In his book ''Understanding New Religious Movements'', John A. Saliba writes that the term is overgeneralized. Saliba sees the [[Peoples Temple]] as the &quot;paradigm of a destructive cult&quot;, where those that use the term are implying that other groups will also commit [[mass suicide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;saliba&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Saliba |first=John A. |authorlink= |author2=[[J.

==Racist cults==
[[File:Ku Klux Klan members and a burning cross, Denver, Colorado, 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Cross burning]] by [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in 1915.]]
Sociologist and historian [[Orlando Patterson]] has described the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which arose in the [[American South]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]  as an heretical Christian cult, and their persecution of African Americans and others as a form of [[human sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;’’Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two American Centuries’’, Orlando Patterson, Basic Civitas Books, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Secret [[Aryan]] cults in Germany and Austria in the Nineteenth and early Twentieth centuries had a strong influence on the rise of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;’’[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]’’, [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], NYU Press, Sep 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern [[Skinhead]] groups in the United States tend to use the same recruitment techniques as destructive cults.&lt;ref&gt;’’Hate and Bias Crime: A Reader’’,   Barbara Perry, [[Routledge]], Nov 12, 2012, pages 330-331&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polygamist cults==
Cults that teach and practice [[polygamy]], marriage between more than two people, most often [[polygyny]], one man having multiple wives, have long been noted, although they are a minority.  It has been estimated that there are around 50,000 members of polygamist cults in North America.&lt;ref&gt;The Youngest Bishop in England: Beneath the Surface of Mormonism, Robert Bridgstock, See Sharp Press, Jan 1, 2014, page 102&lt;/ref&gt;  Often polygamist cults are viewed negatively by legal authorities and by society, sometimes including related mainstream denominations, because of perceived links to possible domestic abuse and child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Laws Relating to Sex, Pregnancy, and Infancy: Issues in Criminal Justice, C. Cusack, Springer, May 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, authorities have prosecuted the leaders of two polygamist cults.  Goel Ratzon was living with 32 women and more than 89 children in one compound in Tel  Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=692088 Ratzon Interview before being arrested]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was sentenced to 30 years in jail for sex offences against minors under the age of 16.  He was acquitted of the offense of holding women in slavery.  The State argued that in polygamous cults, slavery can be extended to &quot;mental slavery&quot;, by way of mind control.  The Tel Aviv District Court found that the theory of mind control is not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;See:

The [[Church of Jesus Christ Restored]] is a small sect in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] based at  [[Chatsworth, Ontario]], Canada.

==Terrorist cults==
In the book ''Jihad and Sacred Vengeance: Psychological Undercurrents of History'', [[psychiatrist]] [[Peter A. Olsson]] compares [[Osama bin Laden]] to certain cult leaders including [[Jim Jones]], [[David Koresh]], [[Shoko Asahara]], [[Marshall Applewhite]], [[Luc Jouret]] and [[Joseph Di Mambro]], and says that each of these individuals fit at least eight of the nine criteria for [[narcissistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;piven&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Piven |first=Jerry S. |title=Jihad and Sacred Vengeance: Psychological Undercurrents of History |publisher=iUniverse |year=2002 |location= |pages=104–114 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=0-595-25104-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Seeking the Compassionate Life: The Moral Crisis for Psychotherapy and Society'' authors Goldberg and Crespo also refer to Osama bin Laden as a &quot;destructive cult leader&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg |first=Carl |authorlink= |author2=Virginia Crespo |title=Seeking the Compassionate Life: The Moral Crisis for Psychotherapy and Society |publisher=Praeger/Greenwood |year=2004 |location= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=0-275-98196-7 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 2002 meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), anti-cultist [[Steven Hassan]] said that [[Al Qaida]] fulfills the characteristics of a destructive cult. He added: &quot;We need to apply what we know about destructive mind-control cults, and this should be a priority with the war on terrorism. We need to understand the psychological aspects of how people are recruited and indoctrinated so we can slow down recruitment. We need to help counsel former cult members and possibly use some of them in the war against terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dittmann&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Dittmann |first=Melissa |title=Cults of hatred: Panelists at a convention session on hatred asked APA to form a task force to investigate mind control among destructive cults. |work=Monitor on Psychology |volume=33 |number=10 |page=30 |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |date=10 November 2002 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/nov02/cults.html |accessdate=18 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on [[Al-Qaeda|Al-Qaida]] published in ''[[The Times]]'', journalist [[Mary Ann Sieghart]] wrote that al-Qaida resembles a &quot;classic cult&quot;, commenting: &quot;Al-Qaida fits all the official definitions of a cult.

Former [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mujaheddin]] member and now author and academic Dr. Masoud Banisadr stated in a May 2005 speech in Spain :
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If you ask me: are all cults a terrorist organisation? My answer is no, as there are many peaceful cults at present around the world and in the history of mankind. But if you ask me are all terrorist organisations some sort of cult, my answer is yes. Even if they start as [an] ordinary modern political party or organisation, to prepare and force their members to act without asking any moral questions and act selflessly for the cause of the group and ignore all the ethical, cultural, moral or religious codes of the society and humanity, those organisations have to change into a cult. Therefore to understand an extremist or a terrorist organisation one has to learn about a Cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Banisadr |first=Masoud |title=Cult and extremism / Terrorism |work=Combating Terrorism and Protecting Democracy: The Role of Civil Society |pages= |publisher=Centro de Investigación para la Paz |date=19–20 May 2005 |url=http://www.banisadr.info/speechSpain.htm |accessdate=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the labels &quot;cult&quot; or &quot;sect&quot; to religious movements in government documents signifies the popular and negative use of the term &quot;cult&quot; in [[English (language)|English]] and a functionally similar use of words translated as &quot;sect&quot; in several European languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson01&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Introvigne|first2=Massimo|year=2001|title='Brainwashing' Theories in European Parliamentary and Administrative Reports on 'Cults' and 'Sects'|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=40|issue=2|pages=143–168|doi=10.1111/0021-8294.00046|last1=Richardson|first1=James T.|author1link=James T.

At the height of the counter-cult movement and ritual abuse scare of the 1990s, some governments published [[Governmental lists of cults and sects|lists of cults]].&lt;ref&gt;or &quot;sects&quot; in German-speaking countries, the German term ''Sekten'' (lit. &quot;sects&quot;) having assumed the same derogatory meaning as English &quot;cult&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2000s, some governments have again distanced themselves from such classifications of religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;* [[Austria]]: Beginning in 2011, the United States Department of State's International Religious Freedom Report, as released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor no longer distinguishes sects in Austria as a separate group. {{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=208288|title=International Religious Freedom Report for 2012|publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]|accessdate=3 September 2013}}

* [[France]]: a parliamentary commission of the National Assembly compiled a list of purported cults in 1995. In 2005, the Prime Minister stated that the concerns addressed in the list &quot;had become less pertinent&quot; and that the government needed to balance its concern with cults with respect for public freedoms and [[laïcité]].
* [[Germany]]: The legitimacy of a [[Governmental lists of cults and sects#Germany|1997 Berlin Senate report]] listing cults (''Sekten'') was defended in a court decision of 2003 (Oberverwaltungsgericht Berlin (OVG 5 B 26.00) 25 September 2003), and the list is still maintained by Berlin city authorities ([http://www.berlin.de/sen/familie/sekten-psychogruppen/ Sekten und Psychogruppen - Leitstelle Berlin]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== USA ===
In the 1970s, the scientific status of the &quot;[[Mind control|brainwashing theory]]&quot; became a central topic in U.S. court cases where the theory was used to try to justify the use of the forceful [[deprogramming]] of cult members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis, 2004&quot;&gt;[[#Lewis2004|Lewis]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1996&quot;&gt;Davis, Dena S. 1996 &quot;Joining a Cult: Religious Choice or Psychological Aberration&quot; Journal of Law and Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, sociologists critical of these theories assisted advocates of [[religious freedom]] in defending the legitimacy of new religious movements in court. While the official response to new religious groups has been mixed across the globe, some governments aligned more with the critics of these groups to the extent of distinguishing between &quot;legitimate&quot; religion and &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;unwanted&quot; cults in [[public policy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;refRichardsonIntrovigne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edelman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/nr.2003.6.2.312 |last1=Edelman |first1=Bryan |last2=Richardson |first2=James T. |year=2003 |title=Falun Gong and the Law: Development of Legal Social Control in China |journal=Nova Religio |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=312–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States religious activities of cults are protected under the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution]], which prohibits governmental [[establishment of religion]] and protects [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of assembly]].
