For [[Shi'a]] Muslims, Ashura marks the climax of the [[Remembrance of Muharram]],&lt;ref name=Factsanddetails/&gt; and commemorates the death of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the grandson of [[Muhammad]] at the [[Battle of Karbala]] on 10{{nbsp}}[[Muharram]] in the year 61{{nbsp}}AH (&lt;!--in [[Crescent Islamic calendar|AHc]]: October 9, and--&gt; in [[Tabular Islamic calendar|AHt]]: October{{nbsp}}10, 680{{nbsp}}CE).

==Etymology==
The root of the word ''Ashura'' has the meaning of ''tenth'' in [[Semitic languages]]; hence the name of the remembrance, literally translated, means &quot;the tenth day&quot;. According to the orientalist A.{{nbsp}}J. Wensinck, the name is derived from the Hebrew ʿāsōr, with the Aramaic determinative ending.&lt;ref&gt;A.{{nbsp}}J. Wensinck, &quot;Āshūrā&quot;, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam{{nbsp}}2''. Retrieved 08/06/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The day is indeed the tenth day of the month, although some Islamic scholars offer up different etymologies.

In his book ''Ghuniyatut Talibin'', [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani|Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani]] writes that Islamic scholars differ as to why this day is known as Ashura, some of them suggesting that it is the tenth most important day with which God has blessed Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Historical background==
{{Main article|Battle of Karbala}}

In April 680 [[Yazid I]] succeeded his father [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]] as the new [[caliph]]. Yazid immediately instructed the governor of [[Medina]] to compel Husayn and a few other prominent figures to pledge their allegiance ([[Bay'ah]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;/&gt; Husayn, however, refrained from making such a pledge, believing that Yazid was openly going against the teachings of Islam and changing the [[sunnah]] of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=&quot;alsunnah.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsunnah.ca/yazid.html|title=Al Bidayah wa al-Nihayah|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsunnah.ca/yazid.html|title=Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, therefore, accompanied by his household, his sons, brothers, and the sons of [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] left Medina to seek asylum in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;/&gt;

On the other hand, the people in [[Kufa]], when informed of Muawiyah's death, sent letters urging Husayn to join them and pledging to support him against the [[Umayyads]]. Husayn wrote back to them saying that he would send his cousin [[Muslim ibn Aqeel]] to report to him on the situation, and that, if he found them united as their letters indicated, he would speedily join them because an [[Imam]] should act in accordance with the [[Quran]] and uphold justice, proclaim the truth, and dedicate himself to the cause of God. The mission of Muslim was initially successful and according to reports 18,000 men pledged their allegiance. But the situation changed radically when Yazid appointed [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]] as the new governor of Kufa, ordering him to deal severely with Ibn Aqeel. Before news of the adverse turn of events had reached Mecca, Husayn set out for Kufa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;/&gt;
  
On the way, Husayn found that his messenger, Muslim ibn Aqeel, had been killed in Kufa. He broke the news to his supporters and informed them that people had deserted him. Then he encouraged anyone who so wished to leave freely without guilt. Most of those who had joined him at various stages on the way from Mecca now left him. Later, Husayn encountered the army of [[Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad]] along the route towards Kufa. Husayn addressed the Kufan army, reminding them that they had invited him to come because they were without an Imam. He told them that he intended to proceed to Kufa with their support, but if they were now opposed to his coming, he would return to where he had come from. In response, the army urged him to proceed by another route. Thus, he turned to the left and reached [[Karbala]], where the army forced him not to go further and stop at a location that was without water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;/&gt;

[[File:20131203 Istanbul 012.jpg|thumb|260px|Name of the Karbala [[Martyrdom|Martyr]] ''Husayn with [[Islamic calligraphy]]'' in [[Hagia Sophia Mosque]]]]
[[Umar ibn Sa'ad]], the head of the Kufan army, sent a messenger to Husayn to inquire about the purpose of his coming to [[Iraq]]. Husayn answered again that he had responded to the invitation of the people of Kufa but was ready to leave if they now were opposed to his presence. When Umar ibn Sa'ad, the head of the Kufan army, reported this back to Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, the governor instructed him to offer Ḥusayn and his supporters the opportunity to swear allegiance to Yazid. He also ordered Umar ibn Sa'ad to cut off Husayn and his followers from access to the water of the Euphrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;/&gt; On the next morning, as ʿOmar b. Saʿd arranged the Kufan army in battle order, [[Al-Hurr ibn Yazid al Tamimi]] challenged him and approached Ḥusayn. He vainly addressed the Kufans, rebuking them for their treachery to the grandson of Muhammad and was killed in the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;/&gt;

The [[Battle of Karbala]] lasted from morning to sunset on October{{nbsp}}10, 680 (Muharram{{nbsp}}10, 61{{nbsp}}AH). Husayn's small group of companions and family members (in total around 72 men and few ladies and children){{efn|Except his young son, Ali, who was severely ill during that battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoseini-e Jalali&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoseini-e Jalali|first1=Mohammad-Reza|title=Jehad al-Imam al-Sajjad|date=1382|others=Translated by Musa Danesh|publisher=Razavi, Printing &amp; Publishing Institute|location=Iran, Mashhad|pages=214–217|language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;در روز عاشورا چند نفر شهید شدند؟&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.porsojoo.com/en/node/70869 |title=در روز عاشورا چند نفر شهید شدند؟ |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326073754/http://www.porsojoo.com/en/node/70869 |archivedate=March 26, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;فهرست اسامي شهداي كربلا&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velaiat.com/shshow.asp?rsabs=43&amp;id=kash |title=فهرست اسامي شهداي كربلا |publisher=Velaiat.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; fought with a large army under the command of Umar ibn Sa'ad and were killed near the river ([[Euphrates]]), from which they were not allowed to get water. The renowned historian [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]] states:
{{quote|… [T]hen fire was set to their camp and the bodies were trampled by the hoofs of the horses; nobody in the history of the human kind has seen such atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chelkowski|first1=Peter J.|title=Ta'ziyeh: Ritual and Drama in Iran|date=1979|location=New York|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before being killed, Husayn said, &quot;If the religion of Muhammad was not going to live on except with me dead, let the swords tear me to pieces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wegoiran.com/iran-information/special-days/day-of-ashoura-islamic-holiday.htm|title=Ashura Day|work=WeGoIran.com|publisher=WeGoIran Travel Agency|location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2010}} Once the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] troops had murdered Husayn and his male followers, they looted the tents, stripped the women of their jewelry, and took the skin upon which [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Zain al-Abidin]] was prostrate. It is said that [[Shemr]] was about to kill him but Husayn's sister [[Zaynab bint Ali|Zaynab]] was able to persuade Umar ibn Sa'ad, the Umayyad commander, to let him live. He was taken along with the enslaved women to the caliph in [[Damascus]] and eventually was allowed to return to [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Madelung&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Madelung|first1=Wilferd|authorlink=Wilferd Madelung|title=ʿALĪ B.

==Commemoration of the death of Husayn ibn Ali==
{{Husayn}}
[[Image:Kerbela Hussein Moschee.jpg|thumb|left|Millions of Shia Muslims gather around the Husayn Mosque in Karbala after making the pilgrimage on foot during [[Arba'een]], which is a Shia religious observation that occurs 40 days after the Day of Ashura.]]
{{Main article|Commemoration of Husayn ibn Ali}}

===History of the commemoration by Shi'a===
According to [[Ignác Goldziher]],

{{quote|[E]ver since the black day of Karbala, the history of this family … has been a continuous series of sufferings and persecutions. These are narrated in poetry and prose, in a richly cultivated literature of martyrologies …'More touching than the tears of the Shi'is' has even become an Arabic proverb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldziher|first1=Ignác|title=Introduction to Islamic Theology and Law|date=1981|location=Princeton|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first assembly (''majlis'') of the Commemoration of Husayn ibn Ali is said to have been held by Zaynab in prison. In Damascus, too, she is reported to have delivered a poignant oration. The prison sentence ended when Husayn's 3-year-old daughter, [[Sakina bint Husayn|Sakina]], died in captivity. She would often cry in prison to be allowed to see her father. She is believed to have died when she saw her father's mutilated head. Her death caused an uproar in the city, and Yazid, fearing a potential uprising, freed the captives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Zaynab Bint Ali | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion | accessdate=January 19, 2008|url=http://www.bookrags.com/Zaynab_bint_Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imam Zayn Al Abidin said the following:

{{quote|It is said that for twenty years whenever food was placed before him, he would weep. One day a servant said to him, 'O son of Allah's Messenger! Is it not time for your sorrow to come to an end?' He replied, 'Woe upon you! [[Jacob]] the prophet had [[Tribes of Israel|twelve sons]], and Allah made [[Benjamin|one of them]] disappear. His eyes turned white from constant weeping, his head turned grey out of sorrow, and his back became bent in gloom,{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#12:84 Quran, 12:84]}} though his son was alive in this world. But I watched while my father, my brother, my uncle, and seventeen members of my family were slaughtered all around me.

Husayn's grave became a pilgrimage site among Shia Muslims only a few years after his death. A tradition quickly developed of pilgrimage to the [[Imam Husayn Shrine]] and the other Karbala martyrs, known as ''[[Ziarat ashura]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular Shiism&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=HOSAYN B.

Public rites of remembrance for Husayn's martyrdom developed from the early pilgrimages{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}.

On the 10th of the month of [[Muharrem]]{{snd}}The [[Ashure]] Day{{snd}}[[Huseyn bin Ali]] was murdered at [[Kerbela]] &lt;ref&gt;Turkish Alevis mourn on this day to commemorate the death of Huseyn bin Ali at [[Kerbala]] in [[Irak]].&lt;/ref&gt; Remembrance by [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]]s, [[Qizilbash]] [[Alevi]]-[[Turkish people|Turks]], and [[Bektashi]]s together in [[Ottoman Empire]]

This day is of particular significance to [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] and [[Alawites]], who consider Husayn (the grandson of Muhammad) [[Ahl al-Bayt]], the third Imam to be the rightful successor of Muhammad.

According to Kamran Scot Aghaie, &quot;The symbols and rituals of Ashura have evolved over time and have meant different things to different people. However, at the core of the symbolism of Ashura is the moral dichotomy between worldly injustice and corruption on the one hand and God-centered justice, piety, sacrifice and perseverance on the other. Also, Shiite Muslims consider the remembrance of the tragic events of Ashura to be an importance way of worshiping God in a spiritual or mystical way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornell|first1=Vincent J.|author2=Kamran Scot Aghaie|title=Voices of Islam|date=2007|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=9780275987329|pages=111–2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_eGWvPTtikC&amp;dq=Karbala+Umayyads|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shi'as make pilgrimages on Ashura, as they do forty days later on Arba'een, to the Mashhad al-Husayn, the [[shrine]] in Karbala, Iraq, that is traditionally held to be Husayn's tomb. On this day Shi'a are in remembrance, and mourning attire is worn. They refrain from listening to or playing music, since Arabic culture generally considers music impolite during death rituals. It is a time for sorrow and for showing respect for the person's passing, and it is also a time for self-reflection, when one commits oneself completely to the mourning of Husayn. Shi'as do not plan weddings and parties on this date. They mourn by crying and listening to recollections of the tragedy and sermons on how Husayn and his family were martyred. This is intended to connect them with Husayn's suffering and [[martyrdom]], and the sacrifices he made to keep Islam alive. Husayn's martyrdom is widely interpreted by Shi'as as a symbol of the struggle against injustice, tyranny, and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/paradigm-akhtar.htm |title=Karbala', an Enduring Paradigm |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'as believe the Battle of Karbala was between the forces of good and evil, with Husayn representing good and Yazid representing evil. Shi'as also believe the Battle of Karbala was fought to keep the Muslim religion untainted by any corruption, and they believe the path down which Yazid was directing Islam was for his own personal greed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[Shia Imams]] strongly insist that the day of Ashura should not be celebrated as a day of joy and festivity. The day of Ashura, according to [[Twelve Imams|Eighth Shia Imam]] [[Ali al-Rida]], must be observed as a day of rest, sorrow, and total disregard of worldly matters.&lt;ref&gt;Ayoub, Shiʻism (1988), pp.{{nbsp}}258 and 259&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the events associated with Ashura are held in special congregation halls known as &quot;[[Imambargah]]&quot; and [[Hussainia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Azadari (mourning) rituals ===

Other [[Marja'|marja]]s like [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi]] promote hemic flagellation rituals as a way of preserving the revolution of Imam al-Husayn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edith Szanto 2012&quot;/&gt;

On Ashura, some Shi'as observe mourning with a blood donation, which is called &quot;Qame Zani&quot;, and flailing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jafariya News Network&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafariyanews.com/2k5_news/feb/20ashur.htm |title=Ashura observed with blood streams to mark Karbala tragedy |publisher=Jafariya News Network |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain traditional [[flagellation]] rituals such as [[Tatbir|Talwar zani]] (''talwar ka matam'' or sometimes ''tatbir'') use a sword.  Other rituals such as ''zanjeer zani'' or ''zanjeer matam'' involve the use of a ''zanjeer'' (a chain with blades).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200506060012 |title=Scars on the backs of the young |work=New Statesman |location=UK |date=June 6, 2005 |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These religious customs show solidarity with Husayn and his family. Through them, people mourn Husayn's death and express regret for the fact that they were not present at the battle to fight and save Husayn and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4620487.ece |work=The Times |location=London  | title=Devout Muslim guilty of making boys beat themselves during Shia ceremony | first=Steve | last=Bird | date=August 28, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/08/27/55577.html |title=British Muslim convicted over teen floggings |publisher=Alarabiya.net |date=August 27, 2008 |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, such as in the Shi'a suburb of Beirut, Shi'a communities organize [[blood donation]] drives with organizations like the [[Red Cross]] or the [[Red Crescent]] on Ashura as a replacement for self-flagellation rituals like ''tatbir'' and ''qame zani''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edith Szanto 2012&quot;/&gt;

For Shi'as, commemoration of Ashura is not a festival but rather a sad event, while Sunni Muslims view it as a victory God gave to Moses. This victory is the very reason, as Sunni Muslims believe, that Muhammad recommended fasting on this day according to a Sunni hadith. For Shi'as, it is a period of intense grief and mourning. Mourners congregate at a mosque for sorrowful, poetic recitations such as ''[[marsiya]]'', ''[[noha]]'', ''[[latmiya]]'', and ''[[soaz]]'' performed in memory of the martyrdom of Husayn, lamenting and grieving to the tune of beating drums and chants of &quot;[[Ya Hussain]]&quot;. Also, [[Ulama]]s give sermons with themes of Husayn's personality and position in Islam, and the history of his uprising. The Sheikh of the mosque retells the Battle of Karbala to allow his listeners to relive the pain and sorrow endured by Husayn and his family. In Arab countries such as Iraq and Lebanon they read [[Maqtal Al-Husayn]]. In some places, such as [[Iran]], Iraq, and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], passion plays known as [[Ta'zieh]] are performed, reenacting the Battle of Karbala and the suffering and martyrdom of Husayn at the hands of [[Yazid I|Yazid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;در روز عاشورا چند نفر شهید شدند؟&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;فهرست اسامي شهداي كربلا&quot; /&gt;

For the duration of the remembrance, it is customary for mosques and some people to provide free meals (''nazri'') on certain nights of the month to all people.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. People donate food and Middle Eastern sweets to the mosque.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} These meals are viewed as being special and holy, as they have been consecrated in the name of Husayn, and thus partaking of them is considered an act of communion with God, [[Hussain]], and [[human race|humanity]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Shias do not fast on the day of Ashura, as per a hadith that prohibits it. Fasting in Islam is reserved for the days where Muslims thank God for things, and the 10th of Muharram is a day when the Prophet's family was slaughtered by Yazid, the son of Muawiya, second Umayyad Sunni caliph.

==Significance for Sunni Muslims==
In a tradition unrelated to Ashura and Karbala, some Sunni Muslims fast on the day of Ashura based on narrations attributed to Muhammad. Some other Sunnis accept Ashura as an important day due to the martyrdom of Husayn and the significance of the events at Karbala. The fasting is to commemorate the day when Moses and his followers were saved from Pharaoh by Allah by creating a path in the Red Sea. According to Muslim tradition, the Jews also fasted on the tenth day. According to [[Sunnah|Sunni Muslim tradition]], [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] narrates that Muhammad came to [[Medina]] and saw the Jews fasting on the tenth day of Muharram. He asked, &quot;What is this?&quot; They said, &quot;This is a good day, this is the day when Allah saved the Children of Israel from their enemy and Musa ([[Moses]]) [[Yom Kippur|fasted on this day]].&quot; He said, &quot;We are closer to Musa than you.&quot; So he fasted on the day and told the people to fast.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fast&quot;&gt;[[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]]. [[Mizan]], ''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novislshar2y4.htm The Fast]'', [[Al-Mawrid]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, John Andrew. ''Islamic Images and Ideas: Essays on Sacred Symbolism''. McFarland &amp; Co, 2013. pp.{{nbsp}}234–236. ISBN 9780786458486&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Marion Holmes ''The Birth of The Prophet Muhammad: Devotional Piety in Sunni Islam''. Routledge, 2007. pp.{{nbsp}}113–115. ISBN 9781135983949&lt;/ref&gt;

This tenth in question is believed to be the tenth of Jewish month of [[Tishri]], which is [[Yom Kippur]] in Judaism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam, Francis E. 1994, p.{{nbsp}}204&quot;&gt;Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, Francis E. Peters, SUNY Press, 1994, p.{{nbsp}}204.&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah designates the tenth day of the seventh month as holy and a fast (Lev.{{nbsp}}16, Lev.{{nbsp}}23, Num.{{nbsp}}29). The word &quot;tenth&quot; in Hebrew is ''Asarah'' or ''Asharah'' (He:עשרה), which is from the same semitic root A-SH-R. According to this tradition, Muhammad continued to observe the veneration of Ashura modeled on its Jewish prototype in late [[September]] until shortly before his death, which the verse of [[Nasi']] was revealed and the Jewish-type calendar adjustments of the Muslims became prohibited. From then on, Ashura became distinct from its Jewish predecessor of Yom Kippur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam, Francis E 1994, p. 204&quot;&gt;Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, Francis E. Peters, SUNY Press, 1994, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A tadjah at Hosay.jpg|thumb|A tadjah at Hosay in [[Port of Spain]] during the 1950s]]
In some countries, other religious communities commemorate this event. According to hadith record in [[Sahih Bukhari]], Ashura was already known as a commemorative day during which some Makkah residents used to observe customary fasting. Muhammad fasted on the day of Ashura, 10th Muharram, in Makkah. When fasting during the month of Ramadan became obligatory, the fast of Ashura was made non-compulsory. This was narrated by Ayesha, wife of Muhammad [[Sahih Muslim]], ''(Hadith-2499)''. In [[Hijra (Islam)|hijrah]] event, when Muhammad led his followers to Medina, he found the Jews of that area likewise observing fasts on the day of Ashura. Seeing this, Muhammad affirmed the Islamic claim to the fast, and from then on Muslims have fasted on combinations of two or three consecutive days including the 10th of Muharram (e.g. the 9th and 10th or the 10th and 11th).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fast&quot;/&gt;

A companion of Muhammad, Ibn Abbas, reports that Muhammad went to Madina and found the Jews fasting on the tenth of Muharram. Muhammad inquired of them, &quot;What is the significance of this day on which you fast?&quot; They replied, &quot;This is a good day, the day on which God rescued the children of Israel from their enemy. So, Moses fasted this day.&quot; Muhammad said, &quot;We have more claim over Moses than you.&quot; Muhammad then fasted on that day and ordered Muslims to fast also.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bukhari, ''{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/031.sbt.html#003.031.222 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126163157/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/031.sbt.html#003.031.222 |archivedate=November 26, 2009 |df=mdy }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnis regard fasting during Ashura as recommended, though not obligatory, having been superseded by the [[Ramadan]] fast. [[Sahih Muslim]], (Hadith-2499)&lt;ref name =Sivan&gt;Emmanuel Sivan. &quot;Sunni Radicalism in the Middle East and the Iranian Revolution&quot;. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol.{{nbsp}}21, No.{{nbsp}}1. (February 1989), pp.{{nbsp}}1–30&lt;/ref&gt;

A hadith narrating the practice is:

{{Quote|Narrated [[Aisha|Ayesha]]:
'Ashura' (i.e., the tenth day of [[Muharram]]), was a day on which the tribe of [[Quraysh tribe|Quraish]] used to fast in the pre-Islamic period of ignorance. The Prophet also used to fast on this day. So when he migrated to [[Madina]], he fasted on it and ordered (the Muslims) to fast on it. When the fasting of [[Ramadan]] was enjoined, it became optional for the people to fast or not to fast on the day of Ashura.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}}}

==Socio-political aspects==
[[File:Sham Ghariban in Imam Reza shrine, Mashhad 13950721 03.jpg|thumb|left|Sham Ghariban ''(the first night in mourn of Husayn)'' in [[Imam Reza Shrine]], [[Mashhad]], Iran]]
Commemoration of Ashura has great socio-political value for the Shi'a, who have been a minority throughout their history. According to the prevailing conditions at the time of the commemoration, such reminiscences may become a framework for implicit dissent or explicit protest. It was, for instance, used during the [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]], the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the Lebanese resistance against the [[Israel-Lebanon conflict|Israeli military presence]] and in the [[1990s Uprising in Bahrain]]. Sometimes the Ashura commemorations associate the memory of Al-Husayn's martyrdom with the conditions of Islam and Muslims in reference to Husayn's [[Live like Ali, die like Hussein|famous quote]] on the day of Ashura: &quot;Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/English/ArtCulture/2004/03/article06.shtml IslamOnline – Art &amp; Entertainment Section] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211012221/http://www.islamonline.net/English/ArtCulture/2004/03/article06.shtml |date=December 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the period of the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] (1905–1911) onward, mourning gatherings increasingly assumed a political aspect. Following an old established tradition, preachers compared the oppressors of the time with Imam Husayn's enemies, the [[umayyads]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Azadari&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Calmard |first=J. | title='AZAÚDAÚRÈ | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate=December 16, 2010|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f2/v3f2a063.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504011659/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f2/v3f2a063.html|archivedate=May 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political function of commemoration was very marked in the years leading up to the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1978–79, as well as during the revolution itself. In addition, the implicit self-identification of the Muslim revolutionaries with Imam Husayn led to a blossoming of the cult of the martyr, expressed most vividly, perhaps, in the vast cemetery of [[Behesht-e Zahra]], to the south of [[Tehran]], where the martyrs of the revolution and the war against Iraq are buried.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azadari&quot; /&gt;

On the other hand, some governments have banned this commemoration. In the 1930s [[Reza Shah]] forbade it in Iran. The regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] saw this as a potential threat and banned Ashura commemorations for many years. In the 1884 [[Hosay massacre]], 22 people were killed in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] when civilians attempted to carry out the Ashura rites, locally known as Hosay, in defiance of the British colonial authorities.

This was because of a [[fatwa]] by a [[Salafi]] Selangor [[mufti]], who had declared the Shias to be heretics. [[Khusrin]] said all the Shia mourners who were detained were to be charged under Section{{nbsp}}12 of the [[Selangor Syariah Criminal Enactment 1995]] which are insulting, rejecting, or dispute the violation of the instructions set out and given a fatwa by the [[Salafi]] religious authorities.

==In the Gregorian calendar==
{{Main article|Islamic calendar}}

While Ashura is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the [[Gregorian calendar]] varies from year to year due to differences between the two calendars, since the Islamic calendar is a [[lunar calendar]] and the Gregorian calendar is a [[solar calendar]]. Furthermore, the appearance of the crescent moon that is used to determine when each Islamic month begins varies from country to country due to the different geographic locations{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.
