'''The Beach Boys''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Hawthorne, California]] in 1961. The group's [[The Beach Boys lineups|original lineup]] consisted of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], and [[Carl Wilson]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and their friend [[Al Jardine]]. They emerged at the vanguard of the &quot;[[California Sound]]&quot;, initially performing original [[surf music|surf songs]] that gained international popularity for their distinct [[vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]] and lyrics reflecting a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance. Rooted in [[jazz]]-based [[vocal music|vocal groups]], 1950s [[rock and roll]], and [[doo-wop]], Brian led the band in devising novel approaches to [[record producer|music production]], [[arranging]] his compositions for [[studio orchestra]]s, and experimenting with several [[musical genre|genres]] ranging from [[pop ballad]]s to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[baroque pop|baroque]] styles.

The group began as a [[garage band]] managed by the Wilsons' father [[Murry Wilson|Murry]], with [[Musicianship of Brian Wilson|Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities]] dominating the group's musical direction. After 1964, their albums took a different stylistic path that featured more personal lyrics, multi-layered sounds, and recording experiments. In 1966, the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and &quot;[[Good Vibrations]]&quot; single vaulted the group to the top level of rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|nascent counterculture era]]. Following ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''{{'}}s [[Collapse of Smile|dissolution]], Brian gradually ceded production and songwriting duties to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of [[mental health]] and [[substance abuse]] issues. The group's public image subsequently faltered, and they struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America. The continued success of their [[greatest hits album]]s during the mid 1970s precipitated the band's transition into an [[oldies]] act, a move that was [[Cultural impact of the Beach Boys#Critical review|denigrated by critics and many fans]]. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, [[Love v. Wilson|songwriting credits]] and use of the band's name transpired.

Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and [[Bruce Johnston]] continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects. For the band's 50th anniversary, all the current surviving members briefly reunited for a [[That's Why God Made the Radio|new studio album]] and [[The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|world tour]]. Even though Wilson and Jardine do not perform with Love and Johnston's band, they remain a part of the Beach Boys' corporation, [[Brother Records|Brother Records Inc]].

At the time of his sixteenth birthday on June 20, 1958, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson|Carl]] – aged thirteen and eleven, respectively – in their family home in [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]]. He had watched his father, [[Murry Wilson]], play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as [[the Four Freshmen]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 3}} 3]}} After dissecting songs such as &quot;[[Ivory Tower (1956 song)|Ivory Tower]]&quot; and &quot;[[Good News (musical)|Good News]]&quot;, Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 12}} 12]}} For his birthday that year, Brian received a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]]. He learned how to [[overdub]], using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 3}} 3]}} Brian played piano with Carl and [[David Marks]], an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, playing guitars they had each received as Christmas presents.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=bnQIAQAAMAAJ|page= 18}} 18]}}

Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to [[Johnny Otis]]' [[KFOX (AM)|KFOX radio]] show.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 3}} 3]}} Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the [[rhythm and blues]] songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school. Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin [[Mike Love]]. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 3}} 3]}} Later, Brian, Mike Love and two friends performed at [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 5}} 5]}} Brian also knew [[Al Jardine]], a high school classmate who had already played guitar in a folk group called the Islanders.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. Love gave the fledgling band its name: &quot;The Pendletones&quot;,{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=7XsZAQAAIAAJ |page= 21}} 21]}} a portmanteau of &quot;[[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]]&quot;, a style of woolen shirt popular at the time and &quot;[[Musical tone|tone]]&quot;, the musical term. Though [[surfing]] motifs were prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group.&lt;ref name=pc20/&gt; He suggested that the group compose songs that celebrated the sport and the lifestyle that it had inspired in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=RockHallofFame/&gt;{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}}{{refn|group=nb|[[Nick Venet]] has said that none of the members, including Dennis, surfed until after the fact.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=w7oB2UKVxgQC|page= 60}} 60]}} }}

Jardine and a singer friend, Gary Winfrey, went to Brian to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record—&quot;[[Sloop John B]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In Brian's absence, the two spoke with their father, a music industry veteran of modest success. Murry arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher, Hite Morgan.&lt;ref name=RockHallofFame /&gt; The group performed a slower ballad, &quot;[[Their Hearts Were Full of Spring]]&quot;, but failed to impress Morgan. After an awkward pause, Dennis mentioned they had an original song, &quot;[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Brian finished the song, and together with Mike Love, wrote &quot;[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]&quot;.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}} The group rented guitars, drums, amplifiers and microphones, and practiced for three days while the Wilsons' parents were on a short vacation.

In October 1961, the Pendletones recorded the two surfing song demos in twelve takes at Keen Recording Studio.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}}{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}{{refn|group=nb|David Marks was not present at the session as he was in school that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-q-a-original-beach-boy-david-marks-on-the-bands-anniversary-tour-20120316 |title=Exclusive QA: Original Beach Boy David Marks on the Band's Anniversary Tour &amp;#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=March 16, 2012 |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of [[Candix Records]] and [[Era Records]], and he signed the group on December 8, 1961.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}} When the boys eagerly unpacked the first box of singles – released both under the Candix label, and also as a promo issue under X Records (Morgan's label) – they were shocked to see their band had been renamed as the Beach Boys.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Murry Wilson called Morgan{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and learned that Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers to directly associate them with the increasingly popular teen sport. But [[Russ Regan]], a young promoter with Era Records – who later became president of [[20th Century Fox Records]] – noted that there already existed a group by that name, and he suggested calling them the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}}

Released in December 1961, &quot;[[Surfin']]&quot; soon aired on [[KFWB]] and [[KRLA]], two of Los Angeles' most influential teen radio stations.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It was a hit on the West Coast, going to number three in Southern California, and peaked at number 75 on the national pop charts. By the final weeks of 1961 &quot;Surfin'&quot; had sold more than 40,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;photobucket13&quot;&gt;[http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q476/marcus1970/hit%20parader%201966/HitParaderp6October1966.jpg &quot;The Beach Boy Empire&quot; Taylor, Derek.

Hit Parader, p13]&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the [[de facto]] manager of the Beach Boys, Murry Wilson landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]],{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=mTM_9JTeoMIC|page= 328}} 328]}} headlined by [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In their earliest public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts that local surfers favored {{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=FC0_AwAAQBAJ|page= 19}} 19]}} before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=sLEMdjRhDgQC|page= 187}} 187]}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=106}} 106]}} Murry effectively seized managerial control of the band, and Brian acknowledged that he &quot;deserves credit for getting us off the ground&amp;nbsp;... he hounded us mercilessly&amp;nbsp;... [but] also worked hard himself.&quot;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In the first half of February 1962, Jardine left the band and was replaced by Marks. The band recorded two more originals on April 19 at Western Studios, Los Angeles: &quot;Lonely Sea&quot; and &quot;[[409 (song)|409]]&quot;. They also re-recorded &quot;[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} {{anchor|Kenny &amp; the Cadets}} During early 1962, Morgan requested that some of the members add vocals to a couple of instrumental tracks that he had recorded with other musicians. This led to the creation of the short-lived group Kenny &amp; the Cadets, which Brian led under the pseudonym &quot;Kenny&quot;. The other members were Carl, Jardine, and the Wilsons' mother Audree.{{refn|group=nb|The only songs the group recorded were two Morgan compositions, &quot;Barbie&quot; and &quot;What Is a Young Girl Made Of?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Richie Unterberger|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Kenny &amp; the Cadets|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kenny-the-cadets-mn0000070397|website=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On June 4, the Beach Boys released their second single &quot;Surfin' Safari&quot; backed with &quot;409&quot;. The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]''. The magazine praised Love's lead vocal and said the song had strong hit potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=June 9, 1962 |title=Reviews of New Singles |magazine=Billboard Magazine |volume= 74 |issue= 23 |page=40 |publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |doi= |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ|page=4}} |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, 1962—after being turned down by [[Dot Records|Dot]] and [[Liberty Records|Liberty]]—the Beach Boys signed a seven-year contract with [[Capitol Records]], based on the strength of the June demo session.&lt;ref name=&quot;photobucket13&quot;/&gt; This was at the urging of Capitol exec [[Nick Venet]] who signed the group, seeing them as the &quot;teenage gold&quot; he had been scouting for.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=w7oB2UKVxgQC|page= 62}} 62]}} By November, their first album was ready—''Surfin' Safari'', which reached 32 on the US Billboard charts. Their song output continued along the same commercial line, focusing on California youth lifestyle.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}}&lt;ref name=pc20&gt;{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19770/m1/ |title=Show 20 – Forty Miles of Bad Road: Some of the best from rock 'n' roll's dark ages. [Part 1&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1963, three months after the release of their debut album, the band began recording their sophomore effort, ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', a breakthrough for Brian, who began asserting himself as songwriter and arranger.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}} The LP was the start of Brian's penchant for [[doubletracking]] vocals,{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=HDrIjd5FQ8QC|page= 126}} 126]}} a pioneering innovation.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=56}} Released on March 25, 1963, ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', met a more enthusiastic reception, reaching number two on the Billboard charts.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This propelled the band into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}} Five days prior to the release of ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', Brian produced &quot;[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]&quot;, a song he had written for [[Jan and Dean]]. &quot;Surf City&quot; hit number one on the ''Billboard'' charts in July 1963, a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had &quot;given away&quot; what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=103–104}}

The result of this arrangement produced the albums ''Surfer Girl'', released on September 16, 1963 and ''Little Deuce Coupe'', released less than a month later on October 7, 1963.

Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the band returned home to face the [[British Invasion]] through the Beatles appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Also representing the Beatles, Capitol support for the Beach Boys immediately began waning. This caused Murry to fight for the band at the label more than before, often visiting their offices without warning to &quot;twist executive arms.&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 50}} 50]}} Brian reacted to the Beatles bemusedly: &quot;I was flipping out.

In June 1964, Brian began recording the bulk of ''The Beach Boys' Christmas Album'' with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with [[The Four Freshmen|Four Freshmen]] arranger [[Dick Reynolds (musician)|Dick Reynolds]].

By the end of the year, the stress of road travel, composing, producing and maintaining a high level of creativity became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a [[panic attack]] only hours after performing with the Beach Boys on the [[variety show|musical variety series]] ''[[Shindig!]]''.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=63–64}} In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, [[Glen Campbell]] served as Wilson's temporary replacement in concert, until his own career success pulled him from the group in April 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1543|label=Glen Campbell|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio, beginning with the vocal sessions for &quot;[[California Girls]]&quot; on June 4, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p18553|label=Bruce Johnston|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs65.html |title=GIGS65 |publisher=Esquarterly.com |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Brian stopped touring in 1965, he became a full-time studio artist, showcasing a great leap forward with ''The Beach Boys Today!'', an album containing a suite-like structure divided by songs and [[ballad]]s, and portended the [[Album Era]] with its cohesive artistic statement.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=111}} 111]}} During the recording sessions for ''Today!'', Love told [[Melody Maker]] that he and the band wanted to look beyond [[surf rock]] and to avoid living in the past or resting on their laurels.&lt;ref name=Welch1964&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Welch|first1=C|title=Beach Boys Brought their own vegetables – so audiences beware!|magazine=Melody Maker|date=November 14, 1964|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting LP had largely guitar-oriented pop songs such as &quot;[[Dance, Dance, Dance (song)|Dance, Dance, Dance]]&quot; and &quot;[[Good to My Baby]]&quot; on side A with B-side ballads such as &quot;[[Please Let Me Wonder]]&quot; and &quot;[[She Knows Me Too Well]]&quot;.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 72}} 72]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.allmusic.com/song/dance-dance-dance-t14595755| title =Dance, Dance, Dance| publisher = Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Today!'' established the Beach Boys as album artists{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|p=43}} and marked a maturation in their lyric content by abandoning themes related to surfing, cars, or teenage love. Some love songs remained, but with a marked increase in depth, along with introspective tracks accompanied by adventurous and distinct arrangements.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=111}} 111]}}{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=58}} While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill them as &quot;America’s Top Surfin' Group!&quot; expecting Brian to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets despite his disinterest.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 62}} 62]}}

In June 1965, the band released ''Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)''. The album included a reworked arrangement of &quot;[[Help Me, Rhonda]]&quot; which became the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965, displacing the Beatles' &quot;[[Ticket to Ride]]&quot;. &quot;[[Let Him Run Wild]]&quot; tapped into the youthful angst that later pervaded their music.{{according to|date=August 2014}} In November 1965, the group followed their US number-three-charting &quot;California Girls&quot; from ''Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)'' with another top-twenty single, &quot;[[The Little Girl I Once Knew]]&quot;. It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far,{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 72}} 72]}} using silence as a pre-chorus, clashing keyboards, moody brass and vocal tics.{{according to|date=August 2014}} The single continued Brian's ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=59}} Perhaps too extreme an arrangement{{according to|date=August 2014}}  to go much higher than its number 20 peak, it was the band's second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Capitol demanded a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, and to appease them, Brian conceived ''Beach Boys' Party!'', a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&amp;B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, [[Bob Dylan]]'s &quot;[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]&quot;, and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier hits.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}} In December they scored an unexpected number two hit (number three in the UK) with &quot;[[Barbara Ann]]&quot;, which Capitol released as a single with no band input.

In October 1966 interviews, Brian touted the album &quot;a teenage symphony to God&quot;.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=91}} His spiritual aims were made explicit in the album's musical contents and lyrics, which also included existential angst, the exploration of human innocence, and the philosophy of childlikeness.{{sfn|Sellars|2015|pp=8–9}} Parks has stated: he and Brian were conscious of the counterculture, and the two had felt estranged from it, but it was necessary to adhere to because of a willingness to &quot;get out of the [[Dwight D.

Many factors [[Collapse of Smile|combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson]] as ''Smile'' neared completion: his mental instability, the pressure to create despite fierce internal opposition to his new music, the relatively unenthusiastic response to ''Pet Sounds'' in the United States, Carl Wilson's [[military draft|draft]] resistance, and a major dispute with [[Capitol Records]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Furthermore, Wilson's reliance on both prescription drugs and [[amphetamine]]s exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. Comparable to [[Brian Jones]] and [[Syd Barrett]], Brian Wilson's use of psychedelic drugs—especially [[LSD]]—led to a nervous breakdown in the late-1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As his legend grew, the ''Smile'' period came to be seen as the pivotal episode in his decline, and he became tagged as a drug casualty.&lt;ref name=Oteri2011/&gt;

Some ''Smile'' tracks were salvaged and re-recorded in scaled-down versions at [[Brian Wilson's home studio|Brian's new home studio]]. Along with the single version of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, these tracks were released on the September 1967 album ''Smiley Smile'', which elicited positive critical and commercial response abroad, but was the first real commercial failure for the group in the United States.{{sfn|DeRogatis|1996|p=18}}  Compounding the group's recent setbacks, their public image took a cataclysmic hit following their withdrawal from the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]]{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=130}} for the reason that they had no new material to play while their forthcoming single and album lay in limbo.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 122}} 122]}} Their cancellation was seen as &quot;...a damning admission that they were washed up [and] unable to compete with the new music.&quot;{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=179}} This notion was exacerbated by ''Rolling Stone'' writer [[Jann Wenner]], who in contemporary publications criticized Brian Wilson for his oft-repeated &quot;genius&quot; label, which he called a &quot;promotional shuck&quot; and an attempt to compare him with the Beatles.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=179}}

While being interviewed in August 1967 for the aborted live album ''[[Lei'd in Hawaii]]'', Brian stated: &quot;I think rock n' roll–the pop scene–is happening. It’s great.

We’re not happening.&quot;{{sfn|Stebbins|Rusten|2013}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}} Former band publicist [[Derek Taylor]] later recalled a conversation with Brian and Dennis where they denied that the group had ever written surf music or songs about cars, and that the Beach Boys had never been involved with the surf and hot rod fads, as Taylor claimed, &quot;...they would not concede.&quot;{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=31}} As a result of their initial target demographic and subsequent failures to blend with the hippie movement, the group was viewed as unhip relics,{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=154}} even though they had once been, as biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] wrote, &quot;the absolute center of the American rock ’n’ roll scene,&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 138}} 138]}} a time when they had ushered the psychedelic era.{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=32}}{{sfn|McCleary|2004|p=42}} In early 1969, Brian proposed that the group change their name from &quot;the Beach Boys&quot; to &quot;the Beach&quot;, reasoning that the band members were now grown men. Going to the effort of acquiring a contract that would declare a five-way agreement to officially rename the group, [[Stephen Desper]] reported, &quot;They all just kind of shrugged and said, 'Aw, come on, Brian, we don't wanna do that.

In 1966, the group had filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against Capitol Records for over two million dollars, which briefly severed their relationship with the label.

For a short time in mid-1968, Brian Wilson sought psychological treatment in hospital.{{sfn|Carlin|2006}} During his absence, other members began writing and producing material themselves.

In spring 1968, Dennis began a strained [[Charles Manson#Involvement with Wilson, Melcher, et al.|relationship with musician]] [[Charles Manson]], which persisted for several months afterward.

After accruing a large monetary debt to the group, Dennis deliberately omitted Manson's credit on its release while also altering the song's arrangement and lyrics.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=186}} This greatly angered Manson.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=137–48}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=221–23}} Growing fearful, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson, [[Manson family|whose family]] had taken over his home.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=224}} He was eventually convicted for [[Conspiracy (criminal)|murder conspiracy]]; from there on, Dennis was too afraid of the Manson family to ever speak publicly on his relationship, let alone testify against him.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|pp=322–23}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=257}}

Under Rieley's management, the group's music began emphasizing political and social awareness.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 155}} 155]}} During this time, Carl Wilson gradually assumed leadership of the band and Rieley contributed lyrics. On August 30, 1971 the band released ''Surf's Up'', named after the Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks composition &quot;[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]&quot;. The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at [[Carnegie Hall]], followed by an appearance with the [[Grateful Dead]] at [[Fillmore East]] on April 27, 1971. The live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of the band's previous songs.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=155–8}} A large portion of their [[set list]]s culled from ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile'', as author Domenic Priore observes, &quot;They basically played what they could have played at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967.&quot;{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 140}} 140]}}

Johnston ended his first stint with the band shortly after ''Surf's Up'''s release, reportedly{{by whom|date=May 2014}} because of friction with Rieley. At Carl's suggestion, the addition of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[Blondie Chaplin]] in February 1972 led to a dramatic restructuring in the band's sound. The album ''Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;'' was an uncharacteristic mix{{according to whom|date=January 2015}} that included two songs written by Fataar and Chaplin.

For their next project the band, their families, assorted associates and technicians moved to the Netherlands for the summer of 1972. They rented a farmhouse to convert into a makeshift studio where recording sessions for the new project would take place. By the end of their sessions, the band felt they had produced one of their strongest efforts yet.{{according to|date=May 2014}} Reprise, however, felt that the album required a strong single. This resulted in the song &quot;[[Sail On, Sailor]]&quot;, a collaboration between Brian Wilson, [[Tandyn Almer]], [[Raymond Louis Kennedy|Ray Kennedy]], Jack Rieley and Van Dyke Parks featuring a soulful lead vocal by Chaplin.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=184, 305}} Reprise subsequently approved and the resulting album, ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]'', was released early in 1973, peaking at number 37. Brian's musical children story, ''Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)'', narrated by Rieley and strongly influenced by [[Randy Newman]]'s ''[[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|Sail Away]]'' (1972), was included as a bonus [[extended play|EP]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=181–2}} Despite indifference from Reprise, the band's concert audience started to grow.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

''[[The Beach Boys in Concert]]'', a double album documenting the 1972 and 1973 US tours, was another top-30 album and became the band's first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] under Reprise. During this period the band established itself as one of America's most popular live acts. Chaplin and Fataar helped organize the concerts to obtain a high quality live performance, playing material off ''Surf's Up'', ''Carl and the Passions'' and ''Holland'' and adding songs from their older catalog. This concert arrangement lifted them back into American public prominence. In late 1973, [[41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti|the 41-song soundtrack]] to ''[[American Graffiti]]'' was released including the band's early songs &quot;Surfin' Safari&quot; and &quot;All Summer Long&quot;. The album was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-10-greatest-summer-songs-20130522/6-the-beach-boys-all-summer-long-0368776 |title=Readers' Poll: The 10 Greatest Summer Songs Pictures – 6.

With these compilations, the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock, propelling themselves from opening for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=193–4}} ''Rolling Stone'' named the Beach Boys the &quot;Band of the Year&quot; for 1974, solely on the basis of their juggernaut touring schedule and material written over a decade earlier.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 194}} 194]}}{{quotation needed|date=May 2014}}

The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=364}} During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=358}} Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted, &quot;[Undoubtedly] the new album is nothing too deep&quot;, but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=364}}

For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album ''Love You'' (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian revealed to Peter Ames Carlin that ''Love You'' is one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, telling him &quot;That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 290}} 290]}} ''Love You'' peaked at number 28 in the UK and number 53 in the US and developed a [[cult following]]; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of [[synthpop]].&lt;ref name=RockHallofFame/&gt;

Referring to &quot;naysayers&quot; of the album, the underground [[fanzine]] ''Scram'' wrote, &quot;Fuck [them] ... [the album showcases] a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliché, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.&quot;{{sfn|Cooper|Smay|2004}} ''[[The A.V.

Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and [[Johnny Carson]]—like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over.

The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at [[Central Park]] on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining neutral.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=216–217}} Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac, Dennis declared to ''Rolling Stone'' on September 3 that he had left the band: &quot;It was Al Jardine who really knifed me in the heart when he said they didn't need me. That was the clincher. And all I told him was that he couldn't play more than four chords. They kept telling me I had my solo album now [''[[Pacific Ocean Blue]]''], like I should go off in a corner and leave the Beach Boys to them. The album really bothers them.

The band broke up for two and a half weeks, until a meeting on September 17 at Brian's house. In light of a potential new Caribou Records contract the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian's vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BBTIMELINE |first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink=|year=2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/1977.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Love denied that the group had ever broken up, explaining that, &quot;It was just the end of the tour, Dennis had a lot on his mind, Carl had a lot on his mind.

Dennis withdrew from the group to focus on his second solo album entitled ''[[Dennis Wilson#Bambu|Bambu]]''.

The Beach Boys' last album for Reprise, ''M.I.U.

Love and Jardine focused on rock and roll-oriented material while Carl and Dennis chose the progressive focus they had established with the albums ''Carl and the Passions'' and ''Holland''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

After departing Reprise, the Beach Boys signed with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]]. They received a substantial advance and were paid $1 million per album even as CBS deemed their preliminary review of the band's first product, ''L.A. (Light Album)'' as unsatisfactory. Faced with the realization that Brian was unable to contribute, the band recruited Johnston as producer. The result paid off, as &quot;[[Good Timin' (The Beach Boys song)|Good Timin']]&quot; became a top 40 single. The group enjoyed moderate success with a disco reworking of the ''Wild Honey'' song &quot;[[Here Comes the Night]]&quot;, followed by their highest charting UK single in nine years: Jardine's &quot;[[Lady Lynda]]&quot; peaked at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The album was followed in 1980 by ''Keepin' the Summer Alive'', with Johnston once again producing. Barring an appearance on percussion on the closing track, &quot;Endless Harmony&quot;, Dennis was absent from this album.

In 1981, Carl quit the group because of unhappiness with the band's nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, subsequently pursuing a solo career.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=124}} 124]}} He returned in May 1982 – after approximately 14 months of being away—on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies and refrain from &quot;[[Las Vegas]]-type&quot; engagements.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=373}}

February 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] earlier in the year, the group became the second artist after [[Aretha Franklin]] to hit number one in the US after their induction.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} They released the album ''Still Cruisin'', which went gold in the US and gave them their best chart showing since 1976.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]''. The album ''[[Summer in Paradise]]'', having no new contributions from Brian because of interference from caretaker [[Eugene Landy]], was released two years later to a poor critical reception, and was a commercial disaster.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, [[Sea of Tunes]], which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded $25&amp;nbsp;million for unpaid royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beachboys.com/history.html &quot;The Beach Boys – The complete Guide&quot;], ''beachboys.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Wilson won his case, Love discovered that Murry Wilson had not properly credited him as co-writer on 79 Beach Boys songs.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, [[Love v. Wilson|Love sued Brian in 1992]], winning $13&amp;nbsp;million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-13/business/fi-8511_1_beach-boys-lead-singer &quot;Company Town : Beach Boys' Mike Love Wins His Case...&quot;] ''Los Angeles Times'' December 13, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the band appeared in [[Michael Feeney Callan]]'s film ''The Beach Boys Today'', which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future.{{full citation needed|date=May 2014}} A few [[Andy Paley sessions|Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions]] occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly cancelled because of personal conflicts.&lt;ref name=mojo2004 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Back To The Beach|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296612,00.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013 |newspaper=Entertainment|date=March 31, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] on a re-recording of &quot;[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]&quot;, which became a British Top-30 hit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In June, the group worked with comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]] on the recording ''Howdy From Maui'', and eventually released ''Stars and Stripes Vol. 1'' in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as [[Toby Keith]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Brian, who was in a better mental state at the time, acted as co-producer.

In early 1997, Carl was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour while undergoing chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and needed oxygen after every song.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=286–287}} However, Carl was able to stand when he played on &quot;[[God Only Knows]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Carl died on February 6, 1998, two months after the death of the Wilsons' mother, Audree, leaving Brian, Jardine and Love as the three remaining original members.

=== Band split and name conflicts ===
[[File:The Beach Boys concierto.jpg|thumb|left|The touring line-up of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston's &quot;The Beach Boys Band&quot;, plus guest member David Marks, in 2008]]
Following Carl's death, the remaining members splintered. Love, Johnston and former guitarist Marks continued to tour without Jardine, initially as &quot;America's Band&quot;, but following several cancelled bookings under that name, they sought authorization through Brother Records Inc. (BRI) to tour as &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; and secured the necessary license.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In turn, Jardine began to tour regularly with his band dubbed &quot;Beach Boys: Family &amp; Friends&quot; until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license. Meanwhile, Jardine sued Love, claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jardine Loses &quot;Beach Boys&quot;|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jardine-loses-beach-boys-20010803|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=August 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court. Jardine, in turn, counter-claimed against BRI for wrongful termination. BRI ultimately prevailed after several years. Love was allowed to continue to tour as &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;, while Jardine was prohibited from touring using any form of the name.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Released from Landy's control, Brian Wilson sought different treatments for his illnesses that aided him in his solo career. He toured regularly with his backing band consisting of members of [[Wondermints]] and other LA/Chicago musicians. Marks also maintained a solo career. Their tours remained reliable draws, with Wilson and Jardine both remaining legal members of the Beach Boys organization and BRI.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The surviving group members appeared as themselves for the 1998 documentary film ''[[Endless Harmony: The Beach Boys Story]]'', directed by [[Alan Boyd]]. Following the success of 1997's ''[[The Pet Sounds Sessions]]'', many compilations were then issued by Capitol containing new archival material: ''[[Endless Harmony Soundtrack]]'' (1998), ''[[Ultimate Christmas]]'' (1998), and ''[[Hawthorne, CA (album)|Hawthorne, CA]]'' (2001).

In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]'', a reinterpretation of the ''Smile'' project that he initiated with the Beach Boys thirty-six years earlier. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the ''[[Daily Mail|Mail On Sunday]]'' that included Beach Boys songs he had recently rerecorded, five of which he co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/04/entertainment/et-quick4.4 |title=Mike Love sues Brian Wilson |last1=Lewis |first1=Randy |date=November 4, 2005 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love's suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/16/entertainment/et-quick16.1 |title=Beach Boys lawsuit dismissed |last1=Lewis |first1=Randy |date=May 16, 2007 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2006, the five surviving Beach Boys (Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston, and Marks) appeared together for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of ''Pet Sounds'' and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, ''[[Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys]]'', in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts, with Wilson accepting on behalf of Dennis and Carl. Throughout the year, it was rumored that the band would reform to perform the ''Pet Sounds'' album live in its entirety in November. Ultimately, Wilson began a brief ''Pet Sounds'' tour with Jardine and no other group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doe|first1=Andrew Grayham|title=BBTIMELINE 2006|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/2006.html|publisher=Endless Summer Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Beach Boys Smile (7300302550).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Reunited in 2012, performing &quot;[[Heroes and Villains]]&quot; in tribute to ''Smile'']]

On October 31, 2011, the Beach Boys released surviving 1960s recordings from ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' in the form of ''[[The Smile Sessions]]''. The album—even in its incomplete form—garnered universal critical acclaim and experienced popular success, charting in both the Billboard US and UK Top 30. The band was rewarded with glowing reviews, including inclusion in Rolling Stone's Top 500 album list at number 381. ''The Smile Sessions'' went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.

In February 2011, the Beach Boys released &quot;[[Don't Fight the Sea]]&quot;, a charity single to aid the victims of the 2011 Japan earthquake. The single, released on Jardine's 2011 album ''A Postcard From California'' featured Jardine, Wilson, Love and Johnston, with prerecorded vocals by Carl Wilson.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Rumors then circulated regarding a potential 50th anniversary band reunion.

On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston and Marks would reunite for a new album and [[Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|50th anniversary tour in 2012]] to include a performance at the [[New Orleans Jazz Festival]] in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Beach_Boys/2011/12/16/19133156.html|title=Beach Boys gear up for reunion |accessdate=December 16, 2011 | work=Sun Media|first=Darryl|last=Sterdan|date=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a &quot;special performance&quot; by organizers.

Later in 2012, the group released the ''[[Fifty Big Ones]]'' and ''Greatest Hits'' compilations along with reissues of 12 of their albums. The next year, the group released ''[[Live – The 50th Anniversary Tour]]'' a 41 song, 2-CD set documenting their ''50th Anniversary Tour''.

==== Resumed band split ====

Love reported that on June 1, 2012, he received an e-mail from Wilson's wife and manager [[Melinda Ledbetter]] stating &quot;no more shows for Wilson&quot;. Love, who is obligated by his license of the Beach Boys name to maintain revenue flow to Brother Records, then began accepting invitations for when the reunion was over.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=402–403}} On June 25, Ledbetter sent another e-mail asking to disregard her last message, but by then, Love says, &quot;it was too late. We had booked other concerts, and promoters had begun selling tickets.&quot;{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=402–403}} The next day, Love announced additional touring dates that would not feature Wilson. Wilson then denied knowledge of these new dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Doyle |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/mike-love-books-beach-boys-shows-without-brian-wilson-20120626 |title=Mike Love Books Beach Boys Shows Without Brian Wilson &amp;#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=viernes 22 de junio del 2012 |url=http://elcomercio.pe/espectaculos/1431754/noticia-beach-boys-confirmaron-gira-america-sur |title=Los Beach Boys confirmaron gira por América del Sur &amp;#124; El Comercio Perú |publisher=Elcomercio.pe |date=June 22, 2012 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love writes: &quot;I had wanted to send out a joint press release, between Brian and me, formally announcing the end of the reunion tour on September 28.

On October 5, Love announced in a self-written press release to the ''LA Times'' that the band would return to its pre-50th Reunion Tour lineup with him and Johnston touring as the Beach Boys without Wilson, Jardine, and Marks:

{{quote|I did not fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. I cannot fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys ... I do not have such authority.

Four days later, Wilson and Jardine submitted a written response to the rumors stating: &quot;After Mike booked a couple of shows with Bruce, Al and I were, of course, disappointed. Then there was confusion in some markets when photos of me, Al and David and the 50th reunion band appeared on websites advertising his shows ... I was completely blindsided by his press release ...

Brian has lost none of his ability to structure those melodies and chord progressions, and when we heard us singing together coming back over the speakers it sounded like 1965 again. Touring was more for the fans. ...

Biographer [[Jon Stebbins]] speculated that Love declined to continue working with the group because of the lesser control he had over the touring process, coupled with the lower financial gain, noting: &quot;Night after night after night after night, Mike is making less money getting reminded that Brian is more popular than him.

{{Further|The Beach Boys lineups}}

In ''Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis'', [[music theory|music theorist]] [[Daniel Harrison (music theorist)|Daniel Harrison]] summarizes:

{{quote|Even from their inception, the Beach Boys were an [[experimental music|experimental]] group. They combined, as [[Jim Miller (musician)|Jim Miller]] has put it, &quot;the instrumental sleekness of [[the Ventures]], the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between [[the Lettermen]] and [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[the Teenagers]]&quot; with lyrics whos images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager. ... [But] it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever. ... Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as [[the Association]], shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so. They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, [[a cappella]] glee-club arrangements containing multiple [[suspension (music)|suspensions]], passing [[musical form|formations]], complex chords, and both [[chromatic]] and [[enharmonic]] [[modulation (music)|modulations]].{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}}}}

[[File:The Beach Boys TV.jpg|thumb|The Beach Boys performing in 1964]]

The Beach Boys began as a [[garage band]] playing 1950s style [[rock and roll]],{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 15}} 15]}} reassembling styles of music such as [[surf music|surf]] to include [[vocal jazz]] [[jazz harmony|harmony]], which created their unique sound.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=36}}{{sfn|Zager|2011|p=216}} In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the [[pop ballad]] by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=35}}  Early on, Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed crisp guitar lines on the group's ballads.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Miller observed, &quot;On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead  ... on ballads, Brian played his [[falsetto]] off against lush, [[jazz]]-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures.&quot;{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Harrison adds, &quot;But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone.&quot;{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}} This new sound was quickly associated with the [[modernism (music)|Modernism]] movement blooming in the Los Angeles music scene.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 16}} 16]}} Among the distinct elements of the Beach Boys' style were the nasal quality of their singing voices, their use of a falsetto harmony over a driving, locomotive-like melody, and the sudden chiming in of the whole group on a key line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jonathan|title=The Influence of the Beatles on the Music of Rock &amp; Roll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgoYAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Columbia College, Columbia University|date=1966|journal=King's Crown Essays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their early years, the Beach Boys released music that displayed an increasing level of sophistication, a period where Brian Wilson consistently acted as the group's primary bandleader, songwriter, producer, and arranger for the group's most commercially and critically successful work.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105–7}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1990&quot;/&gt;  Brian is quoted saying: &quot;Everyone contributed something. Carl kept us hip to the latest tunes, Al taught us his repertoire of folk songs, and Dennis, though he didn't [initially] play anything, added a combustible spark just by his presence.&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In a 1966 article that asks &quot;Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?&quot; Carl responded that every member of the group contributes ideas, but admitted that Brian was majorly responsible for their music.{{sfn|Priore|2005}} In 1967, Dennis was cited as &quot;the closest to brother Brian's own musical ideals ... He always emphasises the fusion, in their work, of pop and classical music.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rave1967/&gt; An appearance by the band on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' in 1980 was highlighted by journalist [[Ben Ratliff]] who explains: &quot;The clip and everything about it—the occasion for its happening, Dennis's shrug, Al Jardine's silence, Carl's gameness, Brian's self-absorption, Mike Love's critical stewardship of the narrative—seems to say a lot, in seven minutes, about who the Beach Boys are and how they worked together.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ratliff2016&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Ratliff|first1=Ben|authorlink1=Ben Ratliff|title=Looking for the Beach Boys|magazine=[[New York Review of Books]]|date=October 26, 2016|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/10/26/looking-for-the-beach-boys-fifty-years-later/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1964, Brian began his breakaway from beach-themed music.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 28}} 28]}} Later in November of the same year, the group expressed desires to advance from the surf rock style for which they initially became known for.&lt;ref name=Welch1964/&gt; ''New York'' magazine would later refer to the albums ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smiley Smile'' as their &quot;[[experimental pop]] phase&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=New York|title=New York |date=1998|volume=31|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=p5MpAQAAIAAJ}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band went on to incorporate many more [[genres]], from [[baroque pop]] to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]] and [[synthpop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beach Boys Biography on All Music.com|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3640|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|last=Bush|first=John|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences ===
{{Further|List of songs covered by the Beach Boys}}

The band's earliest influences came primarily from the work of [[Chuck Berry]]{{refn|group=nb|&quot;[[Surfin' U.S.A.

We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like [[the Crew Cuts]]. Look what gold he mined out of that.&quot;{{sfn|Dillon|2012}} }}

Geoffrey Himes wrote: &quot;Though the Beach Boys are often caricatured as the ultimate white, suburban act, black [[R&amp;B]] was crucial to their sound.&quot;&lt;ref name=HimesSurf /&gt; Carl remembers: &quot;Most of [Mike's] classmates were black. He was the only white guy on his track team. He was really immersed in doo-wop and that music and I think he influenced Brian to listen to it. The black artists were so much better in terms of rock records in those days that the white records almost sounded like put-ons.&quot;&lt;ref name=HimesSurf /&gt; Their eclectic mix of white and black vocal groups – ranging from the rock and roll of Berry, the jazz harmonies of the Four Freshmen, the pop of [[the Four Preps]], the folk of [[the Kingston Trio]], the R&amp;B of groups like [[the Coasters]] and [[the Five Satins]], and the doo wop of [[Dion and the Belmonts]] – helped contribute to the Beach Boys' uniqueness in American popular music.{{sfn|Murphy|2015|p=58}}

While the Beach Boys are not often associated with [[blues]], Brian has called this a misapprehension, citing [[Smokey Robinson]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] as influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Head' Games With Brian Wilson|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67452/head-games-with-brian-wilson|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding surf rock pioneer [[Dick Dale]], Brian clarified that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2005/08/10/brian-wilson-interview-with-brian-wilson/|title=Interview with Brian Wilson|publisher=theaquarian.com|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl himself named Berry, [[the Ventures]], and [[John Walker (musician)|John Walker]] for shaping his guitar style, and that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of the Ventures' songs by ear early in their career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinsche&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Hinsche|first1=Billy|authorlink1=Billy Hinsche|title=Carl Wilson Interview|magazine=[[Guitar One]]|url=http://www.billyhinsche.com/story4.html|date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Jimi Hendrix]] and &quot;heavy&quot; music, Brian said he felt no pressure to go in that direction: &quot;We never got into the heavy musical level trip.

==== Spirituality ====
[[File:Manuscript of Lyrics for God Only Knows - Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Cleveland (by Adam Jones).jpg|150px|thumb|An original handwritten manuscript of the lyrics to &quot;[[God Only Knows]]&quot;]]

The band members often reflected on the spiritual nature of their music (and music in general), particularly for the recording of ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile''.{{sfn|Sellars|2015|pp=8–9}} Even though the Wilson family did not grow up in a particularly religious household,{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=35}}{{sfn|Sellars|2015|p=8}} Carl was described as &quot;the most truly religious person I know&quot; by Brian, and Carl was forthcoming about the group's spiritual beliefs stating: &quot;We believe in God as a kind of [[universal consciousness]]. God is love. God is you. God is me. God is everything right here in this room. It's a spiritual concept which inspires a great deal of our music.&quot;{{sfn|Priore|2005}} Carl told ''Rave'' magazine in 1967 that the group's influences are of a &quot;religious nature&quot;, but not any religion in specific, only &quot;an idea based upon that of Universal Consciousness. ...

Brian is quoted during the ''Smile'' era: &quot;I'm very religious. Not in the sense of churches, going to church; but like the essence of ''all'' religion.&quot;{{sfn|Sellars|2015|p=8}} During the recording of ''Pet Sounds'', Brian held [[prayer meeting]]s, later reflecting that &quot;God was with us the whole time we were doing [the] album ...

Yet his lead singing is real nasal, real punk. Alan’s voice has a bright timbre to it; it really cuts. My voice has a kind of calm sound. We’re big oooh-ers; we love to oooh. It’s a big, full sound, that’s very pleasing to us; it opens up the heart.&quot;&lt;ref name=HimesSurf/&gt;

From lowest [[interval (music)|intervals]] to highest, the group's vocal harmony stack usually began with Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top, according to Jardine,&lt;ref name=Sharp2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|title=Al Jardine of the Beach Boys: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About &quot;SMiLE&quot; (Interview)|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/al-jardine-smile-beach-boys-interview/|website=Rock Cellar Magazine|accessdate=July 2, 2014|date=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Carl said that the blend was Love on bottom, Carl above, followed by Dennis or Jardine, and then Brian on top.&lt;ref name=&quot;HimesSurf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|title=Surf Music|url=http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|website=teachrock.org|publisher=Rock and Roll: An American History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine explains, &quot;We always sang the same vocal intervals. ... As soon as we heard the chords on the piano we’d figure it out pretty easily. If there was a vocal move [Brian] envisioned, he’d show that particular singer that move. We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that [was] never a problem for us.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sharp2013/&gt;

Striving for absolute perfection, Brian's intricate vocal arrangements exercised the group's calculated blend of [[intonation (music)|intonation]], [[attack (music)|attack]], [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], and [[musical expression|expression]].{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|pp=17–19}} Sometimes, he would sing each vocal harmony part alone through multi-track tape.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=w7oB2UKVxgQC|page= 106}} 106]}} [[Jimmy Webb]] has said, &quot;They used very little [[vibrato]] and sing in very straight tones.

=== As instrumentalists ===

The group's instrumental combo initially involved Brian on bass guitar and keyboards, Carl on guitar, and Dennis on drums.{{sfn|Zager|2011|pp=215–16}} Nine months after forming, they acquired national success, and demand for their personal appearance skyrocketed. Biographer James Murphy said, &quot;By most contemporary accounts, they were not a very good live band when they started. ... The Beach Boys learned to play as a band in front of live audiences&quot;, but asserted that they eventually became &quot;one of the best and enduring live bands&quot;.&lt;ref name=RCMMurphy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|title=Catch A Wave: A Chat with Beach Boys Author James B. Murphy|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2015/11/06/becoming-the-beach-boys-author-james-b-murphy-interview/|work=[[Rock Cellar Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the recording of the Beach Boys' instrumental tracks, Brian arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of [[session musician]]s informally known as [[the Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]]. Their assistance was needed because of the increasingly complicated nature of the material.{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=HDrIjd5FQ8QC|page= 127}} 127]}}{{refn|group=nb|Many of the musicians and studios Brian used happened to overlap with those used by Phil Spector.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=88}} }} As a result, a number of songs do not credit the Beach Boys as instrumentalists, but nearly invariably as lead, harmony, or backing vocalists.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It's the belief of [[Richie Unterberger]] that, &quot;Before session musicians took over most of the parts, the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self-contained unit.&quot;{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 71}} 71]}}

Carl continued to play beside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 114}} 114]}} In archivist Craig Slowinski's view, &quot;One should not sell short Carl's own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio. Carl's guitar playing [was] a key ingredient.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/custommusic2/craigslowinskicom.pdf#page=42 |title= The Beach Boys – The Beach Boys Today! |first= Craig|last=Slowinski|year=2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often erroneously stated that Dennis' drumming in the Beach Boys' recordings was filled in exclusively by studio musicians.&lt;ref name=P4K2008&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orme|first1=Mike|title=Pacific Ocean Blue: Legacy Edition|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11943-pacific-ocean-blue-legacy-edition/|publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His drumming is documented on a number of the group's singles, including &quot;I Get Around&quot;, &quot;Fun, Fun Fun&quot;, and &quot;Don't Worry Baby&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slowinski2014&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media notes| title = Keep an Eye on Summer 1964 | others= The Beach Boys| year = 2014|first1=Alan|last1=Boyd|first2=Mark|last2=Linette|first3=Craig|last3=Slowinski|authorlink1=Alan Boyd|authorlink2=Mark Linett|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=Digital Liner|url=http://www.thebeachboys.com/#?news=4111}} ([http://fridaynightboys300.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/the-beach-boys-1964-keep-eye-on-summer.html Mirror])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Songwriting and production ===
{{See also|Brian Wilson's home studio|Brother Studios}}

Brian's experiments with his Wollensak tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for [[exotica]] and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 23}} 23]}} Through attending Phil Spector's sessions sporadically, Brian learned how to act as a producer for records while being educated on the [[Wall of Sound]] process.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=17}} From then on, Brian received some production advice from [[Jan Berry]]. As they collaborated on several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the [[California Sound]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 24}} 24]}}{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=57}} The positive commercial response to Brian's structurally irregular and harmonically varied pop compositions gave him the prestige, resources, and courage to further his creative aspirations.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=36–37}} He proceeded to explore many unusual combinations of instruments while emphasizing inventive percussion{{refn|group=nb|[[Hi-hat]]s were hardly used on Beach Boys records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deevoy|first1=Adrian|title=Beach Boy Brian Wilson: ‘Punk rock?

Although he was often dubbed a perfectionist, Brian was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding was mostly self-taught.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105, 114}} He handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, despite [[Nik Venet]] being credited for producing their early recordings.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=105}} 105]}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=FC0_AwAAQBAJ|page= 26}} 26]}} At the lyric stage, Brian usually worked with bandmate [[Mike Love]],{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=eYyovo_AbqAC|page= 73}} 73]}} whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=chj91X0dWzUC|page=108}} 108]}} Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle, in the examples &quot;[[Lonely Sea]]&quot; and &quot;[[In My Room]]&quot;.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=FC0_AwAAQBAJ|page= 27}} 27]}}

==== After 1967 ====

Foreshadowed by ''Beach Boys' Party!'' (1965), much of the group's recordings from 1967 to 1970 displayed sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41, 46}} Brian briefly experimented with ''[[musique concrete]]''{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=81YIAQAAMAAJ |page= 70}} 70]}} and [[minimalist music|minimalist rock]] approaches to music{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=47}} before retreating to [[Brian Wilson's home studio|his home recording studio]] to record &quot;manic&quot; material in the 1970s, enacting [[syncopation|syncopated exercises]] and [[counterpoint]]s layered on jittery [[eighth note]] [[tone cluster]]s and loping [[Swing (jazz performance style)|shuffle grooves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chidester|first=Brian|title=Brian Wilson's Secret Bedroom Tapes|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2014-01-30/music/brian-wilsons-secret-bedroom-tapes/|accessdate=February 1, 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the infancy of Brian's home studio, the group was forced to improvise many technical aspects of recording. In one instance, they used an empty swimming pool as an [[echo chamber]].{{sfn|Preiss|1979}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}

When Brian abdicated from the group, the other members were forced to take a more active production role.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=46}} This is believed to have faltered the quality of their music.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=130}} [[Richie Unterberger]] believes that after the December 1967 release of ''Wild Honey'', &quot;the Beach Boys were revealed as a group that, although capable of producing some fine and interesting music, were no longer innovators on the level of the Beatles and other figureheads.&quot;{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=1-pH4i3jXvAC|page= 72}} 72]}} The album marked the beginning of Carl's increased role as producer, who described it as &quot;music for Brian to cool out by&quot;,{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=184}} signaling a mellower approach that pervaded into the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1990&quot;/&gt; In 1968, Dennis contributed original songs to ''Friends'', revealing himself as a broodingly soulful songwriter and singer, while Bruce Johnston devised a moody instrumental, &quot;The Nearest Faraway Place&quot;,  for ''20/20'' the following year.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=120–21}}

''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' (1970) marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' (1967).{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} Of the albums between ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'' (1971) and ''Holland'' (1973), Daniel Harrison wrote that they &quot;contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead.&quot;{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} While Harrison adamantly states &quot;1974 is the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock 'n' roll act and became an oldies act,&quot;{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} ''[[Love You (The Beach Boys album)|Love You]]'' (1977) is perceived by some as an oddity that sounds like no other record in their catalog&lt;ref name=&quot;Kempke&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kempke|first=D.
