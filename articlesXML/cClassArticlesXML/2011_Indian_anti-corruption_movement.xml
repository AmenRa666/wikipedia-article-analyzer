The '''Indian anti-corruption movement''', commencing in 2011, was a series of demonstrations and protests across India intended to establish strong legislation and enforcement against perceived endemic [[political corruption]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bloomberg.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-21/indians-divide-over-policing-a-watchdog-world-view.html|title=Indians Divide Over Policing a Watchdog: World View|publisher=bloomberg.com|date=22 June 2011|accessdate=25 August 2011|first=Chandrahas|last=Choudhury|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement gained momentum from 5 April 2011, when anti-corruption activist [[Anna Hazare]] began a [[hunger strike]] at the [[Jantar Mantar]] in [[New Delhi]]. The chief legislative aim of the movement was to alleviate corruption in the [[Indian government]] through introduction of the [[Jan Lokpal Bill]]. Another aim, spearheaded by [[Ramdev]], was the repatriation of [[Indian black money|black money]] from Swiss and other foreign banks.

Grievances of mass protesters focussed on legal and political issues, including political corruption, [[kleptocracy]], and other forms of corruption. The movement was primarily one of non-violent [[civil resistance]], featuring demonstrations, marches, acts of civil disobedience, hunger strikes, marches and rallies, as well as the use of [[social media]] to organise, communicate, and raise awareness. The protests were [[nonpartisan]] and most protesters were hostile to attempts made by political parties to use them to strengthen their own political agendas.

==Background==
{{See also|Corruption in India|List of alleged scams in India|Indian political scandals}}
Issues regarding corruption in India have become increasingly prominent in recent years. The country was subject to socialist-inspired economic policies dating from independence in 1947 until the 1980s. Over-regulation, protectionism, and government ownership of industry led to slow economic growth, high unemployment, and widespread poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Tushar |last1=Poddar |first2=Eva |last2=Yi |year=2007 |title=Global Economics Paper No: 152 |journal=Goldman Sachs Economic Research |page=23 |publisher=[[Goldman Sachs]] |doi= |url=http://www.usindiafriendship.net/viewpoints1/Indias_Rising_Growth_Potential.pdf |accessdate=17 June 2011 |format=PDF | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724120152/http://www.usindiafriendship.net/viewpoints1/Indias_Rising_Growth_Potential.pdf| archivedate= 24 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |year=2007 |title=Economic Survey of India, 2007 |journal=Policy Brief |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/52/39452196.pdf |accessdate=17 June 2011 |format=PDF | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606112149/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/52/39452196.pdf| archivedate= 6 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system of bureaucratic control by government is called the [[License Raj]] and lies at the core of endemic corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/15/wipro-tata-corruption-ent-law-cx_kw_0814whartonindia.html |title=Will Growth Slow Corruption in India? |author=[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] |date=15 August 2007 |work=Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=17 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604044924/http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/15/wipro-tata-corruption-ent-law-cx_kw_0814whartonindia.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vohra Report]] of 1993, submitted by the former Indian Union [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)#Home Secretary and other senior officials|Home Secretary]] [[Narinder Nath Vohra]], studied the issue of the [[criminalisation of politics]]. The report contained several observations made by official agencies on the criminal network which was virtually running a parallel government. It also discussed criminal gangs who enjoyed the patronage of politicians and the protection of government functionaries. It revealed that political leaders had become leaders of street gangs and rogue elements in the military. Over the years, criminals had been elected to [[Panchayati Raj|local bodies]], [[Vidhan Sabha|State Assemblies]], and the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3527710.stm |title=India's love affair with 'tainted' politicians |author=Seema Chishti |date=2 August 2004 |work= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110709044843/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3527710.stm| archivedate= 9 July 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wtcorruption&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=With Indian Politics, the Bad Gets Worse |author=Emily Wax |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/23/AR2008072303390.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=24 July 2008 |accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dionne Bunsha |date=4 December 2004 |title=Dons in a new role |work=Frontline |volume=21 |issue=25 |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2125/stories/20041217001704400.htm |accessdate=17 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Right to Information Act]] (RTI) of 2005 helped civilians work effectively towards tackling corruption. It allows Indian citizens to request information, for a fixed fee of {{INR}}10 ([[US$]]0.22), from a &quot;public authority&quot; (a body of Government or &quot;instrumentality of State&quot;). In turn, this public authority is required to reply to the request within thirty days. Activists have used this to uncover corruption cases against various politicians and bureaucrats – one consequence being that some of those activists have been attacked and even killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dying for data: the Indian activist killed for asking too many questions |author=Jason Burke |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/27/india-rti-activists-deaths |work=The Guardian |date=27 December 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2011 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110709001509/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/27/india-rti-activists-deaths| archivedate= 9 July 2011| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years immediately preceding the 2011 anti-corruption protests there were various notable examples of alleged corruption in the country. These included the [[Adarsh Housing Society Scam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article863396.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Adarsh Society: Army setting up court of inquiry | date=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2010 housing loan scam in India|2010 housing loan scam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-11-24/news/27590728_1_arrests-maninder-singh-johar-corporate-loans | work=The Times of India | title=Housing scam: CBI arrests top officials of PSU banks, financial institutions&amp;nbsp;– Economic Times | date=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Radia tapes controversy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/radia-agent-of-foreign-intelligence-agencies-says-govt-affidavit/1/122879.html |title=Radia agent of foreign intelligence |publisher=[[India Today]] |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2G spectrum scam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12056911 | work=BBC News | title=Indian opposition holds mass protest rally | date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, the Supreme Court of India ordered all trial courts in the country to expedite handling of corruption cases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/supreme-court-fast-tracks-corruption-cases-84632 |title=Supreme Court fast-tracks corruption cases |work=NDTV |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[President of India]], [[Pratibha Patil]], stated that measures to ratify the [[United Nations Convention Against Corruption]] and other legislative and administrative measures necessary to improve transparency would be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/02/india-president-government-to-address-corruption.php |title=Paper Chase: India president: government to address corruption |publisher=JURIST |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Chief Vigilance Commissioner [[P.

==April 2011 protests==
Anna Hazare wanted a joint committee to be formed, comprising members of the government and of civil society, to draft tougher anti-corruption legislation. Manmohan Singh, then [[Prime Minister of India]], rejected Hazare's demand and so Hazare began a hunger strike on 5 April 2011 at Jantar Mantar in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Anna-Hazare-to-start-fast-unto-death-for-strong-Lokpal-Bill/Article1-681415.aspx|title=Anna Hazare to start fast unto death for strong Lokpal Bill |work=Hindustan Times |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the fast would continue until the legislation was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12994855 |title=India activist Anna Hazare anti-graft fast stokes anger |work=BBC News |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110408055959/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12994855|archivedate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His action attracted considerable support, including some people who joined him in fasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/anna-hazares-antigraft-campaign-gathers-steam/148396-3.html |title=Thousands join Anna Hazare's anti-graft fight |work=IBN Live |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=6 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511101056/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/anna-hazares-antigraft-campaign-gathers-steam/148396-3.html| archivedate= 11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent representatives of opposition political parties, including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]], indicated their support for Hazare and demanded government action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110407/jsp/nation/story_13821901.jsp |title=BJP &amp; CPM on activist side – Left party pledges support but wary of company |work=The Telegraph |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011 |first=J.

The government squabbled with the activists, insisting that the drafting committee would be headed by a government-appointed minister and not a civil society member as the protesters had demanded to avoid allowing the government to make the bill less powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiablooms.com/NewsDetailsPage/newsDetails080411g.php |title=Anna Hazare: PM apprises President |date=8 April 2011 |work=India Blooms |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==June protest==
Ramdev had announced in April that he would launch a people's anti-corruption movement called [[Bharat Swabhiman Andolan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/04/14/stories/2011041453631100.htm |title=Ramdev to launch people's movement to root out corruption |work=The Hindu |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109235942/http://www.hindu.com/2011/04/14/stories/2011041453631100.htm |archivedate=9 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13 May it was announced that India had completed ratification of the UN Convention against Corruption, a process that had begun in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-13/india/29539746_1_convention-fight-corruption-assets |title=India ratifies UN convention against corruption |work=The Times of India |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011 |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in the early days of June, four senior Union Ministers - [[Pranab Mukherjee]], [[Kapil Sibal]], [[Pawan Kumar Bansal]] and [[Subodh Kant Sahay]] - met Ramdev to discuss his concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-05/india/29622561_1_ramdev-yoga-guru-hunger-strike |title=Ramdev fast: Chronology of events |work=The Times of India |date=5 June 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011 |agency=PTI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramdev supported Hazare's fast and subsequently led a second major protest at the [[Ramlila Maidan, New Delhi]] on 4 June 2011. He intended to highlight the need for legislation to repatriate black money deposited abroad. He demanded that such untaxed money should be declared to be the wealth of the nation and, further, that the act of caching money alleged to have been obtained illegally in foreign banks should be declared a crime against the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC20110602&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13624741 |title=India yoga guru Baba Ramdev vows anti-graft fast |date=2 June 2011 |work=BBC News |accessdate=17 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603021334/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13624741| archivedate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was alleged that the action was not a spontaneous decision but had been planned for several days. The police said Ramdev had been informed shortly beforehand that permission to continue his agitation had been cancelled.

===Aftermath===

====Civil society response====
Ramdev accused the government of not being serious about discussing issues of corruption and black money, alleging that government negotiator Kapil Sibal had cheated him through a &quot;scheming and cunning&quot; attitude. He alleged that there was a conspiracy to kill him and a &quot;threat&quot; was given to him during a meeting with senior ministers. He also claimed that the ruling government chairperson Sonia Gandhi and the [[United Progressive Alliance]] government will be responsible for any threat to his life and alleged that he was nearly strangled by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/story/baba-ramdev-says-his-fast-will-continue/1/140452.html |title=Baba Ramdev targets Cong, Sonia; says agitation will continue |work=India Today |date=5 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being evicted from Delhi, Ramdev wanted to continue his fast from [[Noida]] but was denied permission to do so by the [[Uttar Pradesh]] government.

Hazare said there might have been some faults with Ramdev's agitation but that the beating up of people at night rather than in the day-time was a &quot;blot on democracy&quot; and that &quot;there was no firing otherwise the eviction was similar to Jallianwala Bagh incident.&quot; He said that the &quot;strangulation of democracy&quot; would cause civil society to launch protests throughout the country to &quot;teach government a lesson&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/anna-to-fast-in-support-of-baba-ramdev/Article1-706052.aspx |title=Anna to fast in support of Baba Ramdev |date=5 June 2011 |publisher=The Hindustan Times |accessdate=6 June 2011 |location=New Delhi |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610190548/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Anna-to-fast-in-support-of-Baba-Ramdev/Article1-706052.aspx |archivedate=10 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Action against Ramdev blot on democracy: Anna Hazare&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_action-against-ramdev-blot-on-democracy-anna-hazare_1551377|title=Action against Ramdev blot on democracy: Anna Hazare|date=5 June 2011|work=DNA |accessdate=5 June 2011|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil society leaders, such as [[Arvind Kejriwal]], said that the use of police force on non-violent sleeping protesters was undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=PTI |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2078919.ece |title=News / National: Civil society activists criticise police action at Ramlila Grounds |publisher=The Hindu |date=5 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.samaylive.com/nation-news/676488104/civil-society-political-parties-condemn-police-action-against-baba-ramdev.html |title=Civil society, political parties condemn police action against Baba Ramdev |publisher=English.samaylive.com |date=5 June 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[All India Congress Committee]] secretary [[Janardan Dwivedi]] described Ramdev's protest as a &quot;political game&quot; by the Bharatiya Janata Party, pointing out that despite being treated in the same hospital as [[Nigamananda]], a protestor who had fasted for over two months regarding a different matter, Ramdev got more attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-ramdev-treated-nigamananda-left-to-die/20110614.htm |title=Ramdev treated, Nigamananda left to die? |work=Rediff |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-June, the Jan Lokpal drafting committee was in disagreement and government representatives said that if a consensus was not reached then two drafts would be sent to the Cabinet, being those of the government and of the civil society representatives.

Within hours, a [[Team Anna]] spokesperson said that he had begun a hunger protest in custody and was not accepting even water to drink.

Delhi police commissioner B. K. Gupta said that the police were not keen for Hazare be sent to judicial custody and had been prepared to release him if he had given an undertaking not to break Section 144 and ask his supporters also not to do so. In a message released after his detention, Hazare said this was the beginning of the &quot;second freedom struggle&quot; and he called on people to participate in a &quot;[[Jail Bharo Andolan|jail bharo]]&quot; agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/anna-in-tihar-jail-govt-faces-opposition-public-anger-updated-126946 |title=Anna in Tihar jail: Govt faces opposition, public anger |work=NDTV |date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazare on 16 August asked government employees across the country to go on mass leave to show solidarity with the movement. Union Home minister [[P.

===Hazare's release===
It was decided to release Hazare after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met party General Secretary Rahul Gandhi, who disapproved of the arrest, on the evening of 16 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/govt-blinks-likely-to-release-anna-sources/176167-3.html |title=Govt blinks, to release Anna Hazare: sources |work=IBN Live |date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress sources said that the Government decided to release him and his supporters after coming to the conclusion that keeping him in jail would disrupt law and order unnecessarily. Over 1,500 people who had been detained for taking part in protests demanding Hazare's release were also freed. However, Hazare then refused to leave the jail until the government agreed to give unconditional permission to hold protests at [[Jai Prakash Narayan National Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ndtv&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/anna-hazare-to-be-released-from-tihar-jail-tonight-say-sources-126962| title=Anna Hazare refuses to come out of Tihar Jail| work=NDTV |date=16 August 2011| accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazare agreed to leave after Delhi Police granted him permission to fast for 15 days at Ramlila Maidan, a larger venue than Jai Prakash Narayan National Park.

On the second day of the fast, a day ahead of schedule, Hazare repeated his threat to campaign against Congress in the five poll-bound states for not bringing a strong Lokpal. His deteriorating health and the low turn-out across the country were among the reasons for then ending the fast. He said that the movement was not stopped, merely postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anna Hazare calls off fast, cancels jail bharo campaign|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-28/india/30564941_1_jail-bharo-anna-hazare-general-elections|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced the cancellation of the &quot;Jail Bharo&quot; movement due to his bad health.

===Parliament debate===
The Lok Sabha debated the Lokpal Bill on 27 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sushma Swaraj punches holes in government's Lokpal bill|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sushma-Swaraj-punches-holes-in-governments-Lokpal-bill/articleshow/11265687.cms|accessdate=27 December 2011|work=The Times of India|date=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate resulted in the bill being passed to the Rajya Sabha but the new nine-man Lokpal panel was not given constitutional status because the government failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority of MPs present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lokpal Bill in Rajya Sabha: Govt hunts for numbers with eye on Mamata|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/lokpal-bill-in-rajya-sabha-govt-hunts-for-numbers-with-eye-on-mamata-161368|accessdate=28 December 2011|work=NDTV|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lokpal Bill passed in Lok Sabha, but no constitutional status|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/lokpal-bill-passed-in-lok-sabha-but-no-constitutional-status-161294|accessdate=28 December 2011|work=NDTV|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lokpal Bill was sent for review to the Indian President, Pratibha Patil, on 28 December 2011. This is standard operating procedure for any legislation that will have financial implications. She later gave her assent for the Bill to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lokpal Bill in Rajya Sabha: Govt hunts for numbers with eye on Mamata|work=NDTV|accessdate=28 December 2011|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/lokpal-bill-in-rajya-sabha-govt-hunts-for-numbers-with-eye-on-mamata-161368|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was reinvigorated following an initial mass gathering at [[Jantar Mantar]], [[New Delhi]] on 25 March 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNA India&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_anna-hazare-to-fast-on-march-25-in-delhi_1662419 |title=Anna's Fast on 25-March-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IBN Live&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/anna-hazare-to-fast-on-march-25-in-delhi/239201-37-64.html |title=Anna Hazare to fast on 25-March-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to introduce some form of legislation, even though weaker than that demanded by the activists, had timed-out with the end of the [[parliamentary session]] on 27 December 2011.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2758728.ece No vote on Lokpal, Rajya Sabha adjourns abruptly]&lt;/ref&gt; The government reintroduced the bill in the Rajya Sabha in February 2012 but the bill was not timetabled for debate and the session ended without this bill being passed.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

===Protests===
Hazare declared that the protest movement would recommence and a mark of protest he sat on hunger strike on 25 March 2012 for one day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneindia.com/2008/05/15/videos-china-quake-death-toll-rises-to-15-000.html|title=China quake: Death toll rises to 15,000|date=15 May 2008|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Hazare sat a token one-day fast focussed on remembrance of whistle-blowers such as [[Narendra Kumar]] and [[Satyendra Dubey]] who had died as a result of their support for the anti-corruption cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/anna-to-protest-at-jantar-mantar-on-march-25/242015-37.html|title=Anna to protest at Jantar Mantar on March 25|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June, Hazare undertook another one-day fast at [[Jantar Mantar]], where he was joined by [[Ramdev]], a [[yoga]] [[guru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/anna-hazare-baba-ramdev-to-fast-on-june-3-200055?pfrom=home-otherstories|title=Anna Hazare, Baba Ramdev to fast on June 3|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazare and Bedi reformed Team Anna, while Kejriwal and some others split from the erstwhile apolitical movement with the intention of forming what was to become the [[Aam Aadmi Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/what-is-the-aam-aadmi-party-all-about/1/234564.html|title=So what is the Aam Aadmi Party all about|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jantar Mantar was the scene of an &quot;indefinite&quot; fast that began on 25 July and involved various members of Team Anna,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/team-anna-to-launch-indefinite-hunger-strike-today-for-lokpal-bill-anna-will-join-fast-from-july-29-247251?pfrom=home-lateststories|title=Team Anna launches indefinite hunger strike today for Lokpal Bill; Anna will join fast from July 29|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Hazare was not involved until four days later. The focus on this occasion was a protest against the government's refusal of an inquiry against the prime minister and 14 cabinet ministers, whom they had accused of corruption.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The fast ended on 3 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/india-against-corruption-team-anna-breaks-fast-to-form-party-for-cleaning-system/articleshow/15340341.cms |publisher=The Times Of India | title=India Against Corruption: Team Anna breaks fast, to form party for 'cleaning system' | date=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Hazare announced that since the government seemed to be unready to enact the Jan Lokpal Bill, he and his fellow activists had decided to end their fast, to discontinue talks with the government and to cease any protests under the Team Anna name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/anna-hazare-disbands-team-anna_792022.html|title= Anna Hazare disbands ‘Team Anna’ | date= 6  August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
After failing to press government to pass [[The Lokpal Bill, 2011]], the Team Anna split on issue of formation of political party. Anna Hazare and some others did not want to enter mainstream politics while Arvind Kejriwal led [[India Against Corruption]] opined to join politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-19/india/33951624_1_anna-hazare-team-anna-members-political-alternative |title=Anna Hazare confirms rift with Arvind Kejriwal, says his apolitical mass movement will continue |publisher=Times of India|first1=Radheshyam |last1=Jadhav |first2=Sarang |last2=Dastane |date=19 September 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=India Against Corruption assets caught in tug of war |publisher=Business Standard |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/india-against-corruption-assets-caught-in-tug-of-war-112092203017_1.html |date=22 September 2012|author=Sreelatha Menon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arvind Kejriwal and others finally formed new political party, [[Aam Aadmi Party]] (AAP) on 26 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arvind Kejriwal formally launches Aam Aadmi Party|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/arvind-kejriwal-aam-aadmi-party-formal-launch-jantar-mantar/1/234729.html|publisher=India Today|accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IT20120919&quot;&gt;{{cite news |agency=PTI  |location=New Delhi |date=19 September 2012 |title=Anna Hazare tells Arvind Kejriwal not to use his name, photo for votes as they part ways |publisher=India Today |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/team-anna-split-anna-hazare-arvind-kejriwal-part-ways/1/217947.html |accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;intoday1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=So what is the Aam Aadmi Party all about|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/what-is-the-aam-aadmi-party-all-about/1/234564.html|date=24 November 2012|publisher=India Today|location=New Delhi |accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the party made its electoral debut in the [[Delhi Legislative Assembly election, 2013|2013 Delhi legislative assembly election]] held in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aam Aadmi Party gets broom as election symbol|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/aam-aadmi-party-gets-broom-as-election-symbol/410942-37.html|accessdate=2 August 2013|publisher=IBN Live|date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged as the second-largest party, winning 28 of the 70 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eciresults.nic.in/PartyWiseResult.htm |publisher=Election Commission of India |title=Assembly Elections December 2013 Results |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no party obtaining an overall majority, the AAP formed a [[minority government]] with conditional support from the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arvind Kejriwal becomes Delhi's youngest Chief Minister |publisher=IBN |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/assembly-elections-2013/delhi-assembly-elections/Aam-Admi-Arvind-Kejriwal-takes-oath-as-Delhi-CM-vows-change-in-governance/articleshow/28047952.cms |date=28 December 2013 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAP failed to pass Jan Lokpal Bill in Delhi assembly and resigned from the government after rule of 49 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/arvind-kejriwal-quits-over-jan-lokpal/article5688528.ece |title=Arvind Kejriwal quits over Jan Lokpal |first1=Mohammad |last1=Ali |first2=Vishal |last2=Kant |first3=Sowmiya |last3=Ashok |newspaper=The Hindu |date=15 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President's rule]] imposed in the state for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Presidents-rule-imposed-in-Delhi/articleshow/30558345.cms|title=President's rule imposed in Delhi - Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
