'''&quot;Every Sperm is Sacred&quot;''' is a musical sketch from the film ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]''. The song was released on the album ''[[Monty Python Sings]]'' and was nominated for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Music Award for Best Original Song in a Film in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;pythons&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Content and production==
The song is a [[satire]] of [[Humanae Vitae|Catholic teachings on reproduction]] that forbid [[masturbation]] and [[contraception]] by artificial means.  The sketch, called &quot;The [[Third World]]&quot;, is about a Catholic [[Yorkshire]] man played by [[Michael Palin]], with his wife played by director [[Terry Jones]]. They have sixty-three children, who are about to be sold for scientific experimentation purposes because their parents can no longer afford to care for such a large family with the local mill being closed. When their children ask why they do not use contraception or sterilisation, or why the father does not perform self-castration, their father explains that this is against God's wishes, and breaks into song, the chorus of which is:

: ''Every sperm is sacred,''
: ''Every sperm is great.''
: ''If a sperm is wasted,''
: ''God gets quite irate.''

The production in ''The Meaning of Life'' was filmed in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], [[Skipton, North Yorkshire]] and choreographed by [[Arlene Phillips]] to a storyboard by Jones. The hearty and cheerful nature of the musical number is counterpointed as the children are marched off to their fate as the song ends, singing a dour rendition of the chorus as their middle-aged [[Protestant]] neighbours (played by [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Eric Idle]]) comment on the teachings of the [[Catholic Church]]. They ironically add that they have two children, which is the exact number of times they have had sex in their marriage. This is a joke on the stereotype that Protestants control their reproduction by barely having any sex at all.

The song is a [[parody|style pastiche]] of the song &quot;[[Consider Yourself]]&quot;, from the musical ''[[Oliver!]]'' by [[Lionel Bart]]. Later, Jones denied that it was explicitly written to make fun of the genre of [[musical comedy]]: &quot;'Every Sperm is Sacred' is not a parody of these things, it just ''is'' those things, it's a musical song, it's a hymn, it's a Lionel Bart-style musical, but it's not making fun of a Lionel Bart-style musical.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pythons&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Religion===
The religious import of the sketch is significant, and is reflected in the widely dispersed usage of the phrase. In the book ''Monty Python and Philosophy'', the argument is teased out to reach a broader (still humorous) conclusion: &quot;The Pythons ask us to consider the consequences of the belief that God cares about our reproductive practices and sees everything. If so, then he watches our sexual activities. . . . Christians must concede that all things considered, this [watching people have sex] is one of God's less onerous activities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Masturbation===
It is sometimes difficult to separate the comic from the serious application of the phrase, and two recent publications on the [[penis]] use it for precisely that purpose, ''Talking Cock'', by [[Richard Herring]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reverse censorship==
According to the interview with Palin on the DVD extras, he said ''&quot;at the end of my '''sock'''&quot;'' in the original scene, with the word &quot;[[penis|cock]]&quot; being overdubbed later. This was done because the scene featured numerous [[underage]] children and the Pythons were already concerned they were &quot;pushing the limit.&quot; Years later, several of the child actors stated they had no idea what they were singing about.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd&quot;&gt;{{cite video | url=http://www.amazon.com/Pythons-Meaning-Two-Disc-Collectors-Edition/dp/B0000A0MFJ | title=Monty Python's the Meaning of Life (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) (1983) | publisher=[[Universal Studios]] | work=[[Amazon.com]] | date=2 September 2003 | people=[[Monty Python]] | medium=[[DVD]] | asin=B0000A0MFJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
