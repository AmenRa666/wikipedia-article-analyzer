'''Nicholas''' &quot;'''Nick'''&quot; '''Xenophon''' (born '''Xenophou'''; 29 January 1959) is an Australian senator for [[South Australia]] and the leader of the [[Nick Xenophon Team]] (NXT) political party in the [[Australian Senate]]. He was first elected to a six-year Senate term in the [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] as an [[Independent politicians in Australia|independent]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] and was re-elected at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], before forming the nascent NXT and electing a total of four representatives including one in the lower house at the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]]. Xenophon was first elected to [[Parliament of South Australia|South Australian parliament]] at the [[South Australian state election, 1997|1997 state election]] before an unprecedented result at the [[South Australian state election, 2006|2006 state election]], which propelled him to federal parliament.

Xenophon first contested a parliamentary seat and was unexpectedly successful at the 1997 state election. Despite an upper house primary vote of just 2.9 percent, his independent [[No Pokies]] ticket collected many preferences and reached the upper house electoral quota of 8.3 percent, making him the first successful upper house independent in several decades. Campaigning to retain his seat at the 2006 state election, he received unexpected and unprecedented levels of support, with an upper house primary vote of 20.5 percent, resulting in a total of three successful upper house candidates. A year later he stood down to contest the 2007 federal election and was elected to the Senate with an upper house primary vote of 14.8 percent. This increased to 24.9 percent at the 2013 election. The nascent NXT ran candidates in most states and territories including all South Australian seats at the 2016 federal election. As the election was a [[double dissolution]] the Senate electoral quota of 14.3 percent was halved to 7.7 percent. Though NXT's South Australian Senate primary vote was reduced to 21.7 percent, the halved Senate quota resulted in three successful NXT candidates in the upper house alone. NXT was also successful in the South Australian [[Division of Mayo]] in the lower house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|title=Senate Results: South Australia - Australia Votes - Federal Election 2013 (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/results/senate/#snational|title=Senate Results - Australia Votes - Federal Election 2016 (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While his original No Pokies platform centred on an anti-gambling policy, he has since become an advocate in many other policy areas. These include defence, education, health, infrastructure, regional affairs, national security, foreign policy, and civil liberties.

==Early life and legal career==
Xenophon (born Xenophou) was born in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], to Theo Xenophou, from [[Cyprus]], and to Georgia, from [[Greece]]. He is the older of two children. He has been interested in politics since he was a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/from-young-lib-to-senate-linchpin/story-e6frg6p6-1111116755879?nk=9b6ea12376f06bbb261ea8f0fab825a1 |author=[[The Australian]] |title=From brash Young Liberal to Senate linchpin for Nick Xenophon |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophon attended [[Prince Alfred College]] and studied law at the [[University of Adelaide]], completing his [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1981. While at university he was for a period a member of the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]], who used vote rigging to secure him the editorship of the student newspaper ''[[On Dit]]'', an incident Xenophon says helped turn him off party politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23932382-5006787,00.html|title=From brash Young Liberal to Senate linchpin for Nick Xenophon|last=Walker|first=Jamie|work=The Australian|date=28 June 2008|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishers of former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Julia Gillard]]'s 2014 memoir were forced to apologise and retract &quot;false&quot; comments made about this incident in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/publisher-of-julia-gillards-book-retracts-nick-xenophon-allegations-20150223-13mri5.html|title=Publisher of Julia Gillard's book retracts Nick Xenophon allegations|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1982 to 1983, Xenophon worked as a lawyer in private practice. In 1984, he established and became principal of his own law firm, ''Xenophon &amp; Co. Lawyers'', which deals primarily with workers compensation and personal injury claims on a no-win-no-fee basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xenlaw.com.au/ |title=Xenophon &amp; Co Lawyers website |publisher=Xenlaw.com.au |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;qanda&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2306983.htm|title=Welcome to the Senate|author=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=Q&amp;A: Adventures in Democracy|date= 24 July 2008|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this field he became successful and from 1994 and 1997 he served as President of the South Australian branch of the ''Australian Plaintiff Lawyers' Association''. During this time, Xenophon also taught law at the [[University of South Australia]], where future political opponent [[Christopher Pyne]] was among his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quick on the law|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|location=Adelaide, Australia|date=7 November 1998|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; After legislation was passed in 1992 by the [[John Bannon|Bannon]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government that saw the introduction of [[Slot machine|poker machines]] (pokies) into South Australia in 1993, the increased incidence of [[problem gambling]] came to Xenophon's attention in his legal practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian lawmaker visits S.C. to see anti-gambling efforts|last=Holland|first=Jesse J.|agency=Associated Press|date=12 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smh07&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=5 Minutes 10 Minutes &lt;!-- //.tier-2 --&gt; |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/not-a-pokie-in-sight/story-e6frg8h6-1225967850576 |title=Not a pokie in sight: The Australian 8 December 2010 |work=The Australian  |accessdate=30 November 2011 |date=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophon has also taken a strong stance against wind turbines and has co-sponsored with [[John Madigan (Australian politician)|John Madigan]] legislation to restrict Government subsidies for wind farms. Xenophon's concerns about wind turbines are predominantly related to health and the reliability of wind-sourced power.&lt;ref&gt;http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/EN010008/2.%20Post-Submission/Representations/Further%20information%20requested%20by%20the%20Examining%20Authority/Lynette%20Morris.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wind-watch.org/news/2012/08/02/wind-for-common-sense-stony-gap-wind-farm-knocked-back/|title=Win(d) for common sense: Stony Gap wind farm knocked back - Wind Energy News|author=National Wind Watch|work=National Wind Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The scientific evidence shows that low frequency noise does affect brain activity and can severely affect people's sleep patterns...The problem with wind energy is that it can never replace coal powered energy because it's not reliable enough for base-load power.

==South Australian Legislative Council (1997-2008)==
{{see also|South Australian state election, 1997}}
{{see also|South Australian state election, 2006}}
At the [[South Australian state election, 1997|1997 state election]], Xenophon stood for the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] under an [[Independent politician|Independent]] [[No Pokies]] ticket, advocating the reduction and abolition of [[Slot machine|poker machines]] (colloquially known as &quot;pokies&quot;). He received a vote of 2.86 percent, a statewide total of 25,630 votes â€“ much less than the 8.33 per cent needed to be elected in his own right â€“ but by receiving a large number of [[Ranked voting systems|preferences]] first from microparties and then from [[Grey Power]], he went from a quota of 0.34 to 1.08 and was therefore elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/lchistory.htm|title=Legislative Council Background. South Australia Election 2006|last=Green|first=Antony|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Xenophon the first independent elected to the Legislative Council in 60 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref2&quot; /&gt;

Following the 1997 election, the [[John Olsen|Olsen]] [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] government needed the support of an additional two non-Liberal upper house members in order to pass legislation, with the [[Australian Democrats]] retaining the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] on three seats. However, defectors from [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] in the upper house, [[Terry Cameron]] and [[Trevor Crothers]], often brought Xenophon in to play. In 1998, Xenophon voted with Cameron and the government to proceed with the second reading of the [[Electricity Trust of South Australia|ETSA]] power sale bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1877/is_2_45/ai_n28735494/pg_3/ |title=South Australia: The Australian Journal of Politics and History June 1999 |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petroleum-economist.com/Article/2827341/Australia-debates-sell-offs-as-elections-loom.html |title=Australia debates sell offs as elections loom: Petroleum Economist 2 October 1998 |publisher=Petroleum-economist.com |date=2 October 1998 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill became law when Cameron and Crothers voted with the Liberal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dh5Z_qYIedYC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=cameron+crothers+etsa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HBjSnDprff&amp;sig=m9jwej_IN558qHmzHSpUO3_Ec2w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TlB1Tp2SDMbImAWI9uTNDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cameron%20crothers%20etsa&amp;f=false |title=Power politics: the electricity crisis and you |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election of the [[Mike Rann|Rann]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government at the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 state election]], the government needed an additional five non-Labor upper house members to pass legislation, giving a shared balance of power to the Democrats on three seats, incumbent independents Xenophon and Cameron, with the [[Family First Party]] winning their first seat.

Xenophon was an activist for a range of issues apart from the elimination of poker machines, speaking out on consumer rights, essential services, the environment, taxation, and perks for politicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;qanda&quot;/&gt; Xenophon was also vocal in the Eugene McGee hit-run affair, becoming an advocate for the victim's wife, with public opinion eventually forcing the [[Kapunda Road Royal Commission]] that led to harsher laws for hit-run offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2005/s1369386.htm|title=Legal eagles discuss justice system|date=13 May 2005|work=Stateline (ABC)|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[South Australian state election, 2006|2006 state election]], he ran an aggressive campaign and attracted considerable publicity through a range of imaginative stunts, including riding a model locomotive &quot;gravy train&quot; outside Parliament House to protest MPs' [[superannuation]] entitlements, parading along [[Rundle Mall]] wearing a [[sandwich board]] to advertise his campaign, and bringing a small goat to Parliament urging voters not to &quot;kid around&quot; with their vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SA: Stunt MP turns human sandwich board|last=Ahwan|first=Lauren|date=6 February 2006|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote for me, I kid you not, is Nick's message|last=Anderson|first=Laura|date=18 March 2006|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite media speculation that he would struggle to be re-elected due to the major parties preferencing against him, he attracted sufficient funding and volunteers to staff most state booths on polling day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Manning |first= Dr Haydon |date=December 2006 |title= Australian Political Chronicle: Januaryâ€“June 2006 |journal= Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume= 52 |issue= 4 |page= 668|issn=0004-9522}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received 190,958 first preferences or 20.51 per cent of the total vote, enough to not only be re-elected himself, but also to elect the second [[No Pokies]] candidate, [[Ann Bressington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news10602.html | title=Victory for Labor and Xenophon (Media Release)|last=McCarthy|first=Dr Greg|date=20 March 2006|accessdate=17 November 2009}} McCarthy is a senior lecturer in politics at the [[University of Adelaide]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecsa.sa.gov.au/archive/2006/results/legislative.htm|title=Results for Legislative Council|author=Electoral Commission of South Australia|date=5 April 2006|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His total was 5.46 per cent less than the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], and he outpolled the Liberals in some booths, including the [[electoral district of Enfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/weblog/200603/s1595132.htm|title=The Poll Vault: Xenophon looking good|date=18 March 2006|work=ABC News Online: Elections|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Labor government needing four non-Labor upper house members to pass legislation, No Pokies on two seats shared the balance of power with Family First on two seats, the Democrats on one seat, with the [[Greens South Australia|SA Greens]] winning their first seat.

On 11 October 2007, Xenophon called a press conference at the [[Adelaide Zoo]] in front of the giraffe enclosure, declaring he would &quot;stick his neck out for South Australia&quot; by announcing his resignation from the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] in an attempt to gain election to the [[Australian Senate]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/11/2056680.htm |title=Colourful independent seeks move to Canberra |work=ABC Online |date=11 October 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His platform consisted of anti-gambling and [[consumer protection]] measures, attention to the water crisis affecting the [[Murray River]], ratifying [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]], opposition against a &quot;decrease in state rights&quot;, and opposition to [[WorkChoices]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2006/s2059626.htm|title=Mr X goes to Canberra |last=Royal|first=Simon|work=Stateline SA (ABC) |date=12 October 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2006/s2059634.htm |title=Live Interview Senator Natasha Stott Despoja; Megan Lloyd (Messenger Newspapers) |last=Henschke |first=Ian |work=Stateline SA (ABC) |date=12 October 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Minchin]], a Liberal senator from South Australia,urged people not to vote for Xenophon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nick-minchin-stirs-sa-senate-tensions/story-e6frg6no-1225720690701 |last=Owen |first=Michael |title=Nick Minchin stirs SA Senate tensions |work=The Australian |date=4 June 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/12/2057774.htm |title=No Pokies MP odds-on for Senate seat |last=Haxton |first=Nance |work=ABC Online |date=12 October 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Minor parties prefer Mr X |date=4 November 2007 |last=Nankervis |first=David |work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to running as an independent Xenophon's name did not appear above the line on the ticket, instead he was represented only by the letter &quot;S&quot; above the line, with voters having to search for his details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/12/2058428.htm |title=Libs to put heat on Xenophon: analyst |work=ABC Online |date=12 October 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Xenophon had vacated his Legislative Council seat to run for the Senate, a joint sitting of the South Australian parliament was convened for 21 November 2007 to select Xenophon's replacement. Former valuer-general [[John Darley (Australian politician)|John Darley]], who had stood as the third candidate on Xenophon's ticket in 2006, was appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/13/2089751.htm |title=SA Govt agrees to Xenophon's choice |work=ABC Online |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the joint sitting convened to confirm the nomination, [[Ann Bressington]] criticised Xenophon, questioning his integrity and suitability for federal parliament, suggesting that his &quot;anti-politician&quot; image was more spin than reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;blast&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/21/2096834.htm |title=MPs stunned by Xenophon blast |work=ABC Online |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said Xenophon had demanded she contribute $50,000 towards campaign expenses at the 2006 state election. Xenophon said in response that he was &quot;shocked and hurt&quot; and &quot;deeply upset&quot; that she had failed to share her concerns with him in person, saying &quot;privately and publicly, I have been very supportive of her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/big-blow-for-mr-x/story-e6freo8c-1111114927891 |title=Nick Xenophon's running mate unleashes extraordinary attack |work=The Advertiser |date=1 November 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people whose causes Xenophon had championed also came forward to defend Xenophon, like Di Gilcrist, whose husband's hit and run death resulted in the [[Kapunda Road Royal Commission]]. In an interview the following day, Ms Gilcrist said &quot;based on my experience not only as a victim who's dealt with Nick but also somebody who's worked with Nick and his office... Nick is passionate and he cares and he is empathetic. And he is truly committed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;blast&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2007/s2098060.htm |title=State MP launches scathing attack on Xenophon |last=Haxton |first=Nance |date=22 November 2007 |work=World Today (ABC) |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower House independent [[Kris Hanna]] also defended Xenophon, arguing Bressington had &quot;obviously been out to do some damage&quot; and injure Xenophon's election chances.&lt;ref name=&quot;hurtandbewildered&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/22/2098639.htm?site=elections/federal/2007| title=Xenophon 'hurt and bewildered' by Parliament attack |work=ABC Online |date=22 November 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the campaign, Xenophon walked a large mule down [[Rundle Mall]] to symbolise his stubbornness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fw.farmonline.com.au/news/metro/national/general/the-x-factor/799611.aspx |title=The X factor |work=Farm Weekly (Fairfax) |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon received 14.78 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefs-13745-SA.htm |title=Senate â€“ First Preferences by Candidate â€“ SA |date=20 December 2007 |author=Australian Electoral Commission |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sapo.org.au/binary/binary6881/2007.doc |title=South Australians at the polls: The 2007 national election result analysed |last=Manning |first=Dr Haydon |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2009}} School of Political and International Studies, Flinders University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First term (2008-2014)===
[[File:Nick Xenophon cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Xenophon in September 2008]]
Xenophon shared the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the Senate with the [[Australian Greens]] and the [[Family First Party]]. The [[First Rudd Government]] required the support of two crossbench senators or the opposition to pass legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2011/09/can-the-coalition-win-control-of-the-senate-through-a-half-senate-election.html|title=Can the Coalition win Control of the Senate through a Half-Senate Election?|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] needed to pass its $42 billion [[National fiscal policy response to the late 2000s recession#Australia|economic stimulus package]] passed. Xenophon voted against the package, but ultimately voted for it after amendments allowing it to succeed. Xenophon persuaded the government to bring forward $900 million in [[Murray-Darling basin]] funds and other water projects, which included $500 million over three years for water buybacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson2009-02-13&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Hudson | first = Phillip | date = 13 February 2009 | title = Senate passes stimulus plan |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | location = Sydney, Australia | url = http://business.smh.com.au/business/deal-reached-on-stimulus-package-20090213-86mp.html | accessdate =18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gout2009-02-20&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Gout | first = Hendrik | date = 20 February 2009 | title = Senator Xenophon's audacious bluff | work = [[The Independent Weekly]] | location = [[Adelaide]], Australia | url = http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/senator-xenophons-audacious-bluff/1439707.aspx | accessdate =18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Xenophon labelled the [[Church of Scientology]] as a criminal organisation, making allegations of members experiencing [[blackmail]], [[torture]] and violence, [[labour camp]]s and forced [[imprisonment]], and [[Scientology and abortion|coerced abortions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Xenophon2009-11-18&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Xenophon | first = Nick | date = 18 November 2009 | title = Australian Senator Nick Xenophon's speech on Church of Scientology in full |work=The Times | location = London, United Kingdom | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article6921267.ece | accessdate =19 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bita2009-11-18&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Bita | first = Natasha | date = 18 November 2009 | title = Scientology criminal, says senator Nick Xenophon |work=The Australian | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/scientology-criminal-says-senator-nick-xenophon/story-e6frg6nf-1225799077820 | accessdate =18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/science-or-fiction/story-e6frg6z6-1225799903311|title=Science or fiction? |last=Bita|first=Natasha|work=The Australian|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] stated he shared some of Xenophon's concerns and would consider an inquiry.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2009-11-18&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date = 18 November 2009 | title = Australia mulls Scientology probe |work=BBC News   | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8365606.stm | accessdate =18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VancouverSun2009-11-17&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date = 17 November 2009 | title = Australian PM voices 'concerns' over Scientology |work=Vancouver Sun | location = [[Vancouver]], Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/18/2746928.htm?site=news|title=Police assess Scientology allegations|work=ABC Online|date=18 November 2009|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A request for a Senate inquiry was not successful, with only the Greens voting with Xenophon in support of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/scientology-inquiry-rebuff-a-cop-out-20091119-inqz.html|author=AAP|title=Scientology inquiry rebuff a 'cop out'|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=Sydney, Australia|date=19 November 2009|accessdate=19 March 2010|authorlink=Australian Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/senate-rejects-inquiry-on-scientology-20100318-qicm.html|title=Senate rejects inquiry on Scientology|last=Davis|first=Mark|work=The Age |location=Melbourne, Australia|date=19 March 2010|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Senate committee recommended on 7 September 2010 that a charities commission be formed with the purpose of investigating and monitoring transparency of charitable organisations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bipartisansupport&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Bipartisan support for charities commission | work =[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]  | publisher = [[Australia Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = 7 September 2010 | url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/07/3005360.htm  | accessdate =7 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This recommendation received [[bipartisan support]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bipartisansupport&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bipartisansupport&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bipartisansupport&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2011/s3319927.htm |title=Xenophon disappointed by Scientology report: Lateline 16 September 2011 |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=16 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 2011, Xenophon lost the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] to the Greens. Of this he said:

Xenophon's anti-[[Slot Machine|pokies]] stance was bolstered when independent [[Andrew Wilkie]] was elected lower house at the 2010 election, which resulted in a hung parliament. Wilkie campaigned heavily against pokies at the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s2994058.htm |title=Wilkie, Xenophon team up against pokies: ABC The World Today 26 August 2010 |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=2 October 1980 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for Wilkie's support, the [[Gillard Government]] legislated for mandatory pre-commitment technology which would require people using high-bet machines to pre-commit how much they were willing to bet on a machine before they begin to play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2011/s3245356.htm |title=Wilkie's Gamble: ABC Four Corners 20 June 2011 |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as introducing safer $1 maximum bet per spin machines, which would not require pre-commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cowboy |url=http://www.international.to/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2215:andrew-wilkie-complains-about-opposition-to-his-poker-machine-plans&amp;catid=80:politics&amp;Itemid=120 |title=Andrew Wilkie complains about opposition to his poker machine plans: The International 1 September 2011 |publisher=International.to |date=4 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan came under sustained attack from sporting clubs and various businesses which financially benefit from poker machine use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8351969 |title=Wilkie is fearless on pokies says Xenophon: NineMSN 26 September 2011 |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon accused them of misrepresenting plans and creating hype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Editor |first=State |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/mr-x-hits-back-at-pokies-lies/story-e6frea6u-1226146042200 |title=Mr X hits back at pokies 'lies': AdelaideNow 26 September 2011 |publisher=Adelaidenow.com.au |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition opposed this, with [[Tony Abbott]] saying &quot;it is not [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] policy&quot; and it will be &quot;expensive and ineffective.&quot; Polling indicated the proposals were supported by a majority of voters across the ideological spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff writers |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/liberal-voters-like-pokies-laws/story-fn7x8me2-1226163393107 |title=Liberal voters support pokies crackdown: Herald Sun 11 October 2011 |publisher=Heraldsun.com.au |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Football League|AFL]] boss [[Andrew Demetriou]] rejected suggestions that the AFL was joining Clubs Australia in their media campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-26/demetriou-rejects-afl-linked-to-pokie-campaign/2942900 |title=AFL boss rejects talk of pokie reform campaign: ABC 26 September 2011 |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/shut-up-afl-tells-pokies-campaigners-20110926-1kt63.html |title=Shut up, AFL tells pokies campaigners: SMH 26 September 2011 |work=Sydney Morning Herald  |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs Australia created www.WontWorkWillHurt.com.au as part of their campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wontworkwillhurt.com.au/ |title=Won't Work Will Hurt: Clubs Australia |publisher=Wontworkwillhurt.com.au |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon created a website, www.ItsABigFatLie.com.au, in attempts to counter attacks waged by various sporting commentators against the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ItsABigFatLie.com.au |title=It's A Big Fat Lie: By Senator Xenophon |publisher=Itsabigfatlie.com.au |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs Australia accidentally posted private content on their website which indicated that clubs were purposely exaggerating the impact of the pre-commitment plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=David |first=By |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/clubs-australia-private-strategy-paper-calls-for-trailer-mounted-atms-to-circumvent-federal-governments-poker-machine-reforms/story-e6frfkvr-1226162190038 |title=Clubs Australia private strategy paper calls for trailer-mounted ATMs to circumvent Federal Government's poker machine reforms: News Ltd 9 October 2011 |publisher=News.com.au |date=9 October 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Greens|Greens]] proposed a modification of the plan to remove the pre-commitment and simply institute the $1 bet limit side of the plan. Gillard and Wilkie indicated they were open to the change. Clubs Australia, which had so far amassed a $40 million federal election &quot;warchest&quot; including $250,000 from [[Woolworths Limited|Woolworths]], claimed it would do even more harm to clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pokies-1-limit-favoured-20111014-1lpco.html |title=Pokies $1 limit 'favoured': The Age 15 October 2011 |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=15 October 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Xenophon controversially used [[parliamentary privilege]] to accuse a Catholic priest of rape, in regard to accusations around events that occurred in the 1960s. Monsignor [[David Cappo]] and the Archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson, were accused of failing to properly investigate the allegations in 2007. All three men denied the Senator's claims. Xenophon chose such action after receiving an &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; response from the Church when advising them of his intentions and ultimatum. Capps, who was set to take on a national role by Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]], stepped down from the position after just one week, as well as from SA's Social Inclusion Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Sexton |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-14/the-row-over-the-naming-of-an-alleged-rapist/2899618 |title=Xenophon speech puts parliamentary privilege in spotlight: ABC 7.30 report 15 September 2011 |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/xenophon-overstepped-the-mark-on-parliamentary-privilege-20110915-1kao0.html |title=Xenophon overstepped the mark on parliamentary privilege: SMH 15 September 2011 |work=Sydney Morning Herald  |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/cappo-steps-down-amid-rape-furore-20110915-1kbki.html |title=Cappo steps down amid rape furore: SMH 15 September 2011 |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hockley |first=Catherine |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/ipad/brave-actor-on-an-absolute-abuse/story-fn6bqvxz-1226139369608 |title=Nick Xenophon's defends his actions to name and shame a Catholic priest: AdelaideNow 17 September 2011 |publisher=Adelaidenow.com.au |date=17 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=5 Minutes 10 Minutes &lt;!-- //.tier-2 --&gt; |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/cappo-refused-to-put-claim-to-rome/story-fn59niix-1226139354343 |title=Cappo 'refused' to put claim to Rome: The Australian 17 September 2011 |work=The Australian  |accessdate=30 November 2011 |date=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, after high-level media coverage, Xenophon indicated he might not have used parliamentary privilege had he known the person he accused was about to take a period of leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/xenophon-defends-naming-sa-priest-20110925-1krgm.html |title=Xenophon defends naming SA priest: SMH 25 September 2011 |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 September 2011 |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Xenophon went on a fact-finding mission to Malaysia when he was embroiled in anti-government protests. On 2 May 2012, the [[New Straits Times]] published an article which included words from a 2009 speech made by Xenophon - a vocal supporter of opposition leader [[Anwar Ibrahim]] - but distorted into an attack on Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/observer-under-scrutiny-1.79786|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502134808/http://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/observer-under-scrutiny-1.79786|title=Observer under scrutiny|archivedate=2 May 2012|work=New Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech had been focused on [[Scientology]].

===2013 election campaign===
{{see also|Australian federal election, 2013}}
At the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]] Xenophon nominated four key policy issues he would pursue if successfully re-elected: gaming machine reforms, stopping [[palm oil]] from being sold in Australia, breaking up the supermarket [[duopoly]], and better deals for Riverland irrigators in the Murray-Darling basin rescue plan. Xenophon increased his vote to 24.9 percent, a few percent short of two quotas, with running mate [[Stirling Griff]] narrowly missing out on election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/xenophon-slams-bizarre-preference-deals-20130908-2tdgb.html|title=Xenophon slams bizarre preference deals|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; From July 2014, Xenophon shared the balance of power with a record [[crossbencher|crossbench]] of 18: the Greens on 10 seats, [[Palmer United Party|Palmer United]] on 1 seat, with other minor parties and independents on 7 seats â€“ the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|LDP]]'s [[David Leyonhjelm]], [[Family First Party|Family First]]'s [[Bob Day]], [[Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party|Motoring]]'s [[Ricky Muir]], and independents [[John Madigan (Australian politician)|John Madigan]], [[Jacqui Lambie]] and [[Glen Lazarus]]. The [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government requires the support of at least 6 non-Coalition Senators to pass legislation through the Senate.

A record number of candidates stood at the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2013/08/record-number-of-candidates-to-contest-2013-election.html |title=Record Number of Candidates to Contest 2013 Election |authorlink=Antony Green |author=Green, Antony |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Group voting ticket]]s came under scrutiny because multiple candidates were provisionally elected with the vast majority of their 14.3 percent quotas coming from the preferences of other parties across the political spectrum. &quot;Preference whisperer&quot; [[Glenn Druery]] organised tight cross-preferencing between many minor parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/bitter-dispute-erupts-over-senate-preferences-in-queensland/4939300|title=Bitter dispute erupts over Senate preferences in Queensland|work=ABC News|date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2013/08/glen-dreuery-the-preference-whisperer.html|title=Glen Druery - the 'preference whisperer'|work=ABC Brisbane|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/preference-whisperer-defends-minor-party-success|title='Preference whisperer' defends role in minor parties' Senate success|author=Bridie Jabour|work=the Guardian|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since returning to a balance of power position in the Senate, Xenophon has been predominantly concerned with defence materiel, particularly the [[Collins-class submarine replacement project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-21/xenophon-calls-for-clarity-on-submarine-build-plan/6171918|title=Submarine program: Nick Xenophon calls for clarity on number of new subs Australia will buy|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cuts made by the [[Abbott Government]] in the [[2014 Australian federal budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickxenophon.com.au/blog/budget-is-mean-nasty-and-dumb/|title=Budget is mean, nasty and dumb - Nick Xenophon - Independent Senator for South Australia|work=nickxenophon.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; He voted against the tertiary education reforms proposed by [[Minister for Education and Training]] [[Christopher Pyne]] which would have seen a shift towards privatisation of universities in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/nick-xenophon-opposed-to-higher-ed-reforms/story-e6frgcjx-1227141941200|title=Xenophon opposed to higher ed reforms|date=2 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophon opposed the amendments to the national security legislative framework, particularly on the issue of [[telecommunications data retention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-17/xenophon-journalists-metadata/6326858|title=Metadata laws: journalists will remain unprotected|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2014 &quot;spycatcher&quot; speech to the Senate, Xenophon stated that the new laws would have a [[chilling effect]] on investigative journalism in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZI8vcCIGxI|title=Spycatcher 1985 &amp; National Security Bill 2014|date=25 September 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon negotiated with then [[Minister for Immigration and Border Protection]] [[Scott Morrison (politician)|Scott Morrison]] for the reintroduction of the [[Temporary Protection Visa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickxenophon.com.au/blog/xenophon-i-wont-take-fake-moral-high-ground/|title=Xenophon: I won't take fake moral high ground - Nick Xenophon - Independent Senator for South Australia|work=nickxenophon.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he travelled to Indonesia with an Adelaide sheikh to seek clemency for the [[Bali Nine]] duo who were on death row.&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian.com&quot;/&gt; Xenophon wrote an article in [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]] in [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], the first time in the paper's 184-year history that it printed an article in a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/nick-xenophons-bahasa-indonesian-appeal-over-bali-nine-duo-20150318-1m27tr.html|title=Nick Xenophon's Bahasa Indonesian appeal over Bali nine duo|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts, and those of the [[Abbott Government]], were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-29/andrew-chan-and-myuran-sukumaran-executed/6426654|title=Bali Nine: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran executed by Indonesian firing squad|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophon supported the [[Abbott Government]]'s Direct Action plan for combating [[Climate Change]], enabling it to pass the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2014/10/18/nick-xenophons-ploy-price-carbon/14135508001142#.VVXp2GBa_dl|title=Nick Xenophon's ploy to price carbon|work=The Saturday Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later stated that the plan had been &quot;neutered&quot; because of changes made to it via regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/10/direct-action-climate-scheme-has-been-neutered-says-nick-xenophon|title=Direct Action climate scheme has been 'neutered', says Nick Xenophon|author=Lenore Taylor|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014, Xenophon publicly called for Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] to adopt a more conciliatory and less &quot;confrontational&quot; style in his leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;adelaidenow.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/senate-reform-could-boost-nick-xenophon-kill-off-minor-parties/news-story/0d9d44c77f301498ef250eb767d2b4b0|title=Mr X's vote victory will kill off minor parties|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the second anniversary of [[Tony Abbott]]'s election victory, Xenophon appeared at the entrance to the Australian Senate with a submarine cake he made to remind the Abbott Government of its pre-election commitment to build 12 submarines in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickxenophon.com.au/media/nicks-must-reads/show/strewth-column-the-australian/|title=Strewth Column - The Australian - Nick Xenophon - Independent Senator for South Australia|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2015/09/07/xenophon-cooks-storm-govt-anniversary/|title=Xenophon cooks up a storm for Govt anniversary - The New Daily|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnqQq3TNj0|title=Nick Xenophon celebrates Tony Abbott's 2nd anniversary with a submarine cake|first=|last=Qldaah|date=6 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the night [[Malcolm Turnbull]] successfully challenged [[Tony Abbott]], becoming the new Prime Minister, Xenophon's first act was to send a letter reminding him of the Government's submarine commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-15/nick-xenophon-writes-to-malcolm-turnbull-on-sa-submarines/6776498|title=Xenophon writes to Turnbull on submarines and auto jobs|date=14 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2015, Xenophon joined calls for a royal commission into the [[Australia-East Timor spying scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-27/xenophon-calls-for-royal-commission-east-timor-spying-scandal/6981084|title=Nick Xenophon calls for royal commission into East Timor spying scandal|date=27 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-06/22/c_134345841.htm|title=Former Australian spy Witness K facing criminal prosecution in Australia - Xinhua - English.news.cn|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon joined with the [[Australian Greens]] and the Government to support a reform of the Senate election system.&lt;ref name=&quot;adelaidenow.com.au&quot;/&gt; Other crossbench senators, like [[John Madigan (Australian politician)|John Madigan]] and [[David Leyonhjelm]], accused Xenophon of &quot;political trickery of the highest order&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/22/crossbench-senators-seething-at-being-dumped-in-deal-to-curb-micro-parties|title=Crossbench senators seething at being 'dumped' in deal to curb micro-parties|first1=Lenore|last1=Taylor|first2=Daniel|last2=Hurst|date=22 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon has held this position since September 2013, some nine months before newly elected senators were sworn in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickxenophon.com.au/media/releases/show/senate-voting-needs-urgent-reform/|title=Senate Voting Needs Urgent Reform - Nick Xenophon - Independent Senator for South Australia|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the [[Australian Financial Review]]: &quot;This puts the power back into the hands of the voters and away from the back-room operators and preference whisperers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/news/politics/nick-xenophon-steps-up-push-for-senate-changes-20160126-gmeots#ixzz419d7CPm9|title=Nick Xenophon steps up push for Senate changes|date=28 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nascent [[Nick Xenophon Team]] (NXT) ran candidates at the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]] for the upper house with two candidates in each of the six states, a candidate in all eleven lower house seats in South Australia, and additionally a candidate in seven lower house seats in three other states â€“ [[Division of Calare|Calare]], [[Division of Lindsay|Lindsay]], [[Division of Macarthur|Macarthur]] and [[Division of Warringah|Warringah]] in New South Wales, [[Division of Groom|Groom]] and [[Division of Moreton|Moreton]] in Queensland, and [[Division of Higgins|Higgins]] in Victoria. As the election was a [[double dissolution]] the Senate electoral quota of 14.3 percent was halved to 7.7 percent. Though NXT's South Australian Senate primary vote was reduced to 21.7 percent (â€“3.1), the halved Senate quota resulted in three successful NXT candidates in the upper house alone, electing Xenophon and [[Stirling Griff]] for six-year terms and [[Skye Kakoschke-Moore]] for a three-year term. NXT was also successful in the South Australian [[Division of Mayo]] in the lower house, electing [[Rebekha Sharkie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|title=Senate Results: South Australia - Australia Votes - Federal Election 2013 (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/results/senate/#snational|title=Senate Results - Australia Votes - Federal Election 2016 (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/federal-election/nick-xenophon-reveals-his-2016-election-budget-hits-1m/news-story/175e45963ebda967b8b43b46fb3328a0|title=Xenophon's election budget hits $1m|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; NXT's South Australian lower house vote was 21.3 percent. NXT did not poll as highly in other states. The overall nationwide NXT primary vote was 3.3 percent (456,369 votes) in the Senate and 1.9 percent (250,333 votes) in the House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseDefault-20499.htm 2016 election results: AEC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early results from counting on the evening of election night showed that [[Rebekha Sharkie]] would win in [[Division of Mayo|Mayo]] and Xenophon and Griff would win senate seats. Two more lower house seats, [[Division of Grey|Grey]] and [[Division of Barker|Barker]] were possible, as was a third senate seat for [[Skye Kakoschke-Moore]]. After counting and distributing preferences, the NXT candidates in Barker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/guide/bark/ |title=Barker - Australia Votes |work=Election 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/guide/grey/ |title=Grey - Australia Votes |work=Election 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; both placed second to the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] incumbents and placed second in [[Division of Port Adelaide|Port Adelaide]] to the Labor incumbent.

In the presence of NXT candidates in [[Results of the Australian federal election, 2016 (South Australia)|all eleven South Australian seats]], both major parties recorded a suppressed primary vote, resulting in a reduction of the major party primary vote in all but one South Australian seat. Though Labor picked up a two-party swing in all eleven, NXT's presence produced a result where [[Division of Kingston|Kingston]] ended up as the only South Australian seat to record an increase to a major party primary vote. Kingston also recorded the highest major party primary vote of just 49 percent. In NXT's presence, no party won a majority of the primary vote in any of the eleven seats. NXT's lower house primary vote was highest in Mayo (34.9%) and lowest in Adelaide (12.9%). While Mayo has always polled strongest for minor parties, Adelaide's result is in contrast to 2007 where the Xenophon Senate ticket polled better in Adelaide than in most other seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/Website/SenateDivisionMenu-13745-SA.htm 2007 SA Senate vote by seat: AEC]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign Xenophon and the NXT were the subject of numerous attacks from both major political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-30/turnbulls-final-election-pitch-at-press-club/7557568|title=Lambie, Xenophon, Lazarus, Hanson are threat to stability, PM declares|date=30 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included an attack levelled at his failure to declare a directorship of Adelaide Tower Pty Ltd, which involved his father.

===Third term (2016â€“present)===
Xenophon and NXT colleagues have indicated that they will not support the proposed gay marriage plebiscite on the basis that it is not binding and a waste of public resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-23/same-sex-marriage-plebiscite-labor-ramps-up-opposition/7776060|title=Labor ramps up opposition to 'pointless' same-sex marriage plebiscite|date=22 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also thrown support behind the idea that [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]] would provoke a change in US-Australia relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indaily.com.au/news/2016/08/10/trump-presidency-could-prompt-us-alliance-rethink-xenophon/|title=Trump presidency could prompt US alliance rethink|date=10 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
