'''All Saints Church''' is a [[redundant church|redundant]] [[Anglican]] church in the village of [[Holdenby]], [[Northamptonshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II* [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]],&lt;ref name=hg&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1281660|desc= Church of All Saints, Holdenby|access-date= 27 June 2013|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is under the care of the [[Churches Conservation Trust]].&lt;ref name=cct&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/Ourchurches/Completelistofchurches/All-Saints-Church-Holdenby-Northamptonshire/| title = All Saints' Church, Holdenby, Northamptonshire| accessdate = 29 March 2011| publisher = [[Churches Conservation Trust]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The present church was largely built between 1330 and 1340 by Richard Holdenby, the [[lord of the manor]].  It is not the first church on the site, because the presence of a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] is recorded in 1220, but there are no remains of an earlier church.  The [[nave]], the [[aisle]]s, and the lower part of the tower date from the 14th&amp;nbsp;century.  During the 15th&amp;nbsp;century the upper part of the tower was added, and the north aisle was altered and its roof was raised.  In the 1570s [[Christopher Hatton|Sir&amp;nbsp;Christopher Hatton]], [[Lord Chancellor]] to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], built a new mansion and moved the dwellings of the village away from the vicinity of the church, leaving it isolated.&lt;ref name=notes&gt;{{Citation | last = Bellamy| first = Rachel| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = 2003| date = | year = | title = All Saints' Church, Holdenby: Notes for teachers| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = [[Churches Conservation Trust]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1843–44 the [[chancel]] was rebuilt to a design by Sir&amp;nbsp;Henry Dryden of [[Canons Ashby House]].&lt;ref name=hg/&gt;&lt;ref name=cct/&gt;  The church was [[Victorian restoration|restored]] in 1867–68 by [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir&amp;nbsp;George Gilbert Scott]].  This included adding new high-pitched roofs to the nave and the south aisle, renewal of the window [[tracery]], the stained glass and the doors, and the addition of the south porch.&lt;ref name=cct/&gt;&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;  An organ chamber was added to the chancel in 1874.  In 1972, when the [[parish]] was united with that of [[East Haddon]], All Saints was declared redundant, and it came under the care of the Redundant Churches Fund (now the Church Conservation Trust).&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The church is constructed in [[Lias Group|lias]] [[ashlar]] stone with roofs tiled in a fish-scale pattern.  Its plan consists of a nave with north and south aisles, a chancel, and a west tower.  The tower is in  three stages, with a clasping [[buttress]] on the west and an angle buttress at its junction with the nave.  In the lowest stage is a two-light west window.  The top stage contains two-light bell openings on each side and it has a [[battlement|crenellated]] [[parapet]].  On both the north and south sides of the chancel are [[lancet window]]s with [[buttress]]es between them, and the east window consists of a triple lancet with a lozenge-shaped window above it.  In the south wall of the south aisle there are two three-light windows, and similar windows are in the east and west ends.  The porch, which is [[gable]]d, stands between the windows on the south side.  Along the north side of the north aisle are three two-light windows and a doorway.&lt;ref name=hg/&gt;

===Interior===
The nave [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]] are in three [[bay (architecture)|bays]] supported by octagonal [[pier (architecture)|piers]].&lt;ref name=hg/&gt;  At the top of each pier is a [[corbel]] caved with a human head.  In the northeast corner of the south aisle is a tomb recess and a [[piscina]].  The [[rood]] screen was originally in nearby [[Holdenby House]], and was moved into the church in about 1700.  It is elaborately carved with images including lions, exotic plants, and [[gilding|gilded]] heads and suns.  The cross was added to the screen in 1867.  The wooden [[reredos]] behind the altar was also originally in Holdenby House.  The oak [[pulpit]] originated in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century but was altered in the [[Victorian era]].  The octagonal [[baptismal font|font]] originated in the [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] period and was also altered in Victorian times.  The church also contains a Victorian wheeled coffin [[bier]], and a wooden [[alms]] box.  Above the south door hang the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal arms]] of [[George I of Great Britain|George&amp;nbsp;I]].  The choir stalls in the chancel date from the 15th&amp;nbsp;century and were originally in [[Lincoln Cathedral]].  There include [[misericord]]s carved with a variety of images.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

On the walls of the nave and aisles are seven painted panels with [[strapwork]] borders.  They contain text taken from the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568, and so are thought to date from the [[Elizabethan era]].  Also on the walls are zinc panels from the Victorian period inscribed with the [[Lord's Prayer]], the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Creed#Christian creeds|Creed]].  The walls of the chancel are decorated with patterns and the images of two angels.  In one of the windows in the south aisle are fragments of 14th-century stained glass.  The rest of the stained glass is Victorian.  At the east end of the south aisle is an [[alabaster]] floor memorial to William Holdenby, who died in 1490, and his wife.  Also in the church are memorials to other residents of Holdenby House, including [[Henry Agar-Ellis, 3rd Viscount Clifden]], and to members of the White family.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; The two-[[manual (music)|manual]] organ was built in about 1890 by Wordsworth and Maskell of [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&amp;rec_index=D02168 | title = Northamptonshire, Holdenby, Holdenby Church (D02168)| accessdate = 30 October 2010| publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
