[[File:Permiso de conducir plastificado.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A license from Spain, in the format of the [[European driving licence]] ]] 
A '''driver's license''' (US English), '''driver license''' (US English) or '''driving licence''' (UK English) is an official document permitting a specific individual to [[driving|operate]] one or more types of motorized vehicles, such as a [[motorcycle]], [[automobile|car]], [[truck]], or [[bus]] on a public road. The laws relating to the licensing of drivers vary between jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, a license is issued after the recipient has passed a [[driving test]], while in others, a person acquires a license before beginning to drive. Different categories of license often exist for different types of motor vehicles, particularly large trucks  and passenger vehicles. The difficulty of the driving test varies considerably between jurisdictions, as do factors such as age and the required level of practice.

==History==
[[Image:Karl Benz Führerschein.jpg|thumb|The world's first license to drive a motor vehicle, issued to [[Karl Benz]] upon his request.]]
[[Karl Benz]], inventor of the modern automobile, had to receive written permission from the [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Grand Ducal]] authorities to operate his car on public roads in 1888 after residents complained about the noise and smell of his ''[[Benz Patent Motorwagen|Motorwagen]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/authoralbumbackground/2471/der_lappen_hat_geburtstag.html|title=Der Lappen, der die Welt bedeutet|last=Lutteroth|first=Johanna |work=einestages|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]]|language=German|accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the start of the 20th century, European authorities issued licenses to drive motor vehicles similarly ''ad hoc,'' if at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel2008&quot;/&gt;

The first mandatory license requirement for driving was introduced in the [[Motor Car Act 1903]] in the United Kingdom. Every car owner had to register his automobile with his [[local government]] authority and be able to prove registration of his vehicle on request. The minimum qualifying age was set at 17. The license gave its holder 'freedom of the road' with a maximum {{Convert|20|mph|abbr=on}} speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derf.org.uk/history.htm|title=A Brief History of Driver Education in the UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory testing was introduced in 1934, with the passing of the [[Road Traffic Act 1934|Road Traffic Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivinglessons-cumbernauld.com/history-of-driving.html|title=A Potted History of Driving, and the UK Driving Licence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prussia]], then one region of the [[German Empire]], introduced compulsory licensing on September 29, 1903. A test on mechanical aptitude had to be passed and the ''Dampfkesselüberwachungsverein'' (&quot;steam boiler supervision association&quot;) was charged with conducting these tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel2008&quot;/&gt; In 1910, the German imperial government mandated the licensing of drivers on a national scale, establishing a system of tests and [[driver's education]] requirements that was adopted in other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel2008&quot;/&gt;

Other countries in Europe also introduced driving tests during the twentieth century, the last of them being Belgium where, until 1977, it was possible to purchase and hold a license without having to undergo a driving test.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoMotoruSport201104&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title = Altes vom Auto:  Meldungen aus 125 Jahren:Tops und Flops (a summary of the highlights and lowlights of the first 125 years of motoring history) | journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 4 2011| pages = Seite 16 |date = 2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As automobile-related fatalities soared in North America, public outcry provoked legislators to begin studying the French and German statutes as models.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, &quot;Better Auto Laws Are Now Needed,&quot; ''[[New York Times]]'', 1907-08-18, S3.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 1910, North America's first licensing law for motor vehicles went into effect in the US state of New York, though it initially applied only to professional [[chauffeur]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick H. Elliott, &quot;Working Out New Auto Law In New York,&quot; ''[[New York Times]] 1910-10-16, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1913, the state of New Jersey became the first to require ''all'' drivers to pass a mandatory examination before receiving a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New York's Auto Exports Increase-Big Jump in Cars Shipped Last Year-New Jersey Examines All Drivers |publisher=New York Times |date=1913-07-14 |page=11 |accessdate=2009-06-03 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9B07E5DF113CE633A25757C1A9619C946296D6CF | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Driver's licenses used for identification purposes ==
Many countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have no national [[identification card]]s. As many people have driver's licenses, they are often accepted as ''[[de facto]]'' proof of identity. Most identity cards and driver's licenses are [[credit card size]]—the &quot;ID-1&quot; size and shape defined in ISO/IEC 7810.

=== Europe ===

Many European countries require drivers to produce their license on demand when driving. Some European countries require adults to carry proof of identity at all times, but a driving license is not valid for identification in every European country.

In the United Kingdom drivers are not required to carry their licence. A driver may be required by a [[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|constable]] or vehicle examiner to produce their licence, but may provide it in a specified [[police station]] within seven days;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Road Traffic Act 1988|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/164|website=Gov.UK|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=25 August 2014|ref=Section 164 Road Traffic Act, Subsection (6)}} Section 7b refers to providing licence within 7 days.&lt;/ref&gt; the police issue a [[Form (document)|form]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/police/powers/road-traffic/ |title=Road traffic |publisher=Home Office |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, Sweden and Finland, the driver's license number is the same as the citizen's ID number.

In Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Spain, a special vehicle registration card and proof of obligatory insurance is also a driving requirement.

=== Asia ===

In Hong Kong a driving license carries the same number as the holder's [[Hong Kong Identity Card|ID card]], but has no photograph. Upon inspection both must be presented. Plans to make the newly phased in Smart ID contain driving license information have been shelved.

Similarly, the Saudi Arabian government require all drivers to carry an ID card in addition to a license and present them whenever requested. In Saudi Arabia using a license instead is only permitted if the request is made for on-site inspection/identification purposes, especially at checkpoints. Expatriates may be requested to present their visas as well. Women, however, are not allowed to drive at all.

In Japan, South Korea, and Singapore driving license cards are widely used as identification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan_donor&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{Main|Driving licence in Japan}}
Japanese driver's licenses bear one of the following 3 colors on the expiration date.

;Green
:New Drivers (First license in Japan) Valid for 2 to 3 years. Drivers with under one year of driving experience are required to display a &quot;New Driver Tag&quot; (Young Leaf Mark) on their vehicle. This holds true if the driver acquires a license for a different class of vehicle, regardless of the length of driving experience on their previous license. However, such a mark does not indicate necessarily the color on the driver's license. A driver with a young leaf mark on their car could very well be a gold driver. This is because the gold status does not disappear with a change in vehicle class.

;Blue
:Drivers who have fewer than 5 years of clean driving history or who do not have a clean driving record but more than 5 years of driving history. Valid for 3 to 5 years depending on age, violation history, etc.

;Gold
:In addition to the regular license, the {{nihongo|Gold Driver's License|ゴールド免許|Gōrudo Menkyo}}, or {{nihongo|Superior Drivers License|優良運転者免許証|Yūryō Untensha Menkyoshō}}, is a special designation of license given to {{nihongo|&quot;superior drivers&quot;|優良運転者}} in Japan. Holders of such licenses can be identified by the gold band printed over the expiration date of their driver's license.

[[File:Iclicense.jpg|right|thumb|Superior Driver's License, ([[Gold License]])]]
The Gold License is granted to any driver who, at the point of license renewal, has at least five years of clean driving history (no driving infractions).&lt;ref name=&quot;gold-license-aichi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.aichi.jp/police/soudan/qa/koutsuihan/menkyo.html#Q1-6|title=愛知県警察／運転免許に関すること|trans_title=Aichi Prefectural Police / Driver's License Concerns|publisher=愛知県警察 (Aichi Prefectural Police)|language=Japanese|accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gold-license-fukui&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.fukui.jp/kenkei/kotubu/menkyo/koushu/kousinji/kousin-kousyu.htm|title=免許更新時講習について|trans_title=Regarding the Driver's License Renewal Period Training|language=Japanese|publisher=Fukui Prefecture|accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to implications in the Road Traffic Laws Reforms that took place on May 10, 1995, all such licenses are marked with a gold band over the license's expiration date as well as the word 優良 printed in black, below.

Those who hold a gold license have the added benefit of qualifying for the Superior Drivers Course at the time of renewal, a significantly shorter and less-expensive renewal process. In some cases, they can bypass the main license center and have their license renewed at a separate Superior Drivers License Renewal Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;gold-renewal-fukuoka&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.pref.fukuoka.jp/kotsu/unshi/032.html|title=福岡県警察 渡辺通優良運転者免許更新センター（渡辺通ゴールド免許センター|trans_title=Fukuoka Prefectural Police Watanabe Avenue Excellent Driver License Renewal Center (Watanabe Avenue Gold License Center)|language=Japanese|accessdate=2014-10-08|publisher=福岡県警察 (Fukuoka Prefectural Police)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, because such license holders are proven to have been free of accidents and moving violations for at least five years, they are deemed low-risk and qualify for optional car insurance discounts. To qualify, drivers must be accident and violation-free for 5 years and 41 days prior to their birthday on their license's expiration. The period in which the license holder's driving history is reviewed begins on the 40th day prior to their birthday of that year. Should the license holder be deemed to qualify, they will receive a decision in the mail with the word 優良 printed on it.

Even the so-called &quot;Paper Drivers&quot; who hold licenses but never drive, who technically are without violation or accident, can lose their eligibility to obtain a gold license for several reasons including if their car is used by a drunk driver or to support drunk driving in any way.

=== North America ===

In the United States and Canada, driver's licenses are issued by the states or provinces, respectively, and do not look the same nationwide. They are also used as a ''de facto'' identification document. For persons not fit, not eligible, or who otherwise choose not to acquire a driver's license, state (United States) or provincial (Canada) agencies{{spaced ndash}}usually the same as the issuer of driver licenses{{spaced ndash}}will issue an identification card with similar attributes to a driver's license. Identification cards do not enable a person to operate a motor vehicle, a fact typically noted on the ID via the phrase 'Not a driver's license' or similar wording.

===South America===

In Venezuela, the driver's license number is the same as the citizen's ID number.

The number of a driving license issued by the Dominican Republic has the same number as the holder's Dominican Republic ID card.

== Licenses for different categories of vehicles ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}

In a number of countries (including the United States, New Zealand, Australia, UK, Ireland and sometimes Canada as well) people who drive commercially  are required to have special licenses.  The cost of taking the series of tests and examinations to obtain these licenses usually means that an employer would subsidize his or her drivers.

=== Africa ===

==== Nigeria ====

The minimum driving age in the United Kingdom is 16 for [[moped]]s under {{Convert|50|cc|cuin|abbr=on}}, and 17 for cars and [[motorcycle]]s. Access to motorcycles producing more than {{convert|25|kW|abbr=on}} is restricted to riders with two years experience or aged 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/LearnerAndNewDrivers/RidingMotorcyclesAndMopeds/DG_4022568| publisher= Directgov | title= Motorcycles you can ride  | accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Overseas Territories]] and the British [[Crown dependencies]] issue their own driving licences. There is no legal requirement to carry a driving license in the UK whilst driving, although it must be produced at a police station within seven days, if required to do so by a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.police.uk/advice-and-support/laws-and-licences/driving-licences/ Sussex Police - Production of Documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, one must hold a Passenger Carrying Vehicle (PCV) license to drive a vehicle with more than eight passenger seats for hire or reward, or a Large Goods Vehicle (LGV) license to drive a vehicle with a Gross Vehicle Weight (Maximum Authorized Mass) in excess of {{Convert|3500|kg|abbr=on}}. Special licenses are required in order to transport [[hazardous materials]].

The [[Russian Empire]] was one of the first countries to create a [[driving licence]]. Russia's first licences were issued in 1900 by [[Saint Petersburg]] authorities, and Russia joined an international convention in 1909{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. However, due to relatively small number of cars, the attempts to create a standardised Russian licence were rather sporadic and limited to major urban areas. No comprehensive system of driver licensing was present until 1936, when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government organised and standardised traffic and driving regulations, with the statewide system regulated by [[GAI|specialised police authorities]].

Since March 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/infografika/20110301/340188503.html|title=Водительские права нового образца|work=РИА Новости|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are 9 categories that require a driving licence:

*A: any type of motorbike
*B: motorized vehicle under 3.5{{space}}tons (optionally with light trailer)
*C: motorized vehicle over 3.5{{space}}tons (optionally with light trailer, up to 750{{space}}kg)
*D: [[bus]] (has more than 8 passenger seats) (optionally with light trailer, up to 750{{space}}kg)
*BE: motorized vehicle under 3.5{{space}}tons with heavy trailer
*CE: motorized vehicle over 3.5{{space}}tons with heavy trailer
*DE: bus with heavy trailer
*Tram: [[tram]]
*Trolleybus: [[trolleybus]]

Currently Russia employs a system of driver's licenses very similar to the EU standard with two additional categories:{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
*'''A2''' similar to European '''A limited''', as '''A''' does not limit the specs of [[Motorcycle|motorbike]]s
**Bikes with engine displacements lower than 50 cc and speeds lower than 50&amp;nbsp;km/h are considered [[moped]]s and doesn't require license to drive
*'''B1''' for [[tricycle]]s and [[quadracycle]]s.

The current licence style, introduced in 1999, is a laminated plastic card similar to the [[European driving licence]] card in dimensions and outward appearance, with the bearer's photo and name (in Latin and Cyrillic scripts) to the left, place/date of issue, allowed categories and signature to the right. The reverse of the card features a detailed list of allowed categories in Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreigndocuments.com/docs/driver_russia.html|title=Russia Driver License Translation|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older booklet-style licenses are also occasionally seen although they are no longer issued and are increasingly rare as a result. The Russian driving license is also sometimes supplemented by a special card called &quot;временное разрешение&quot; (temporary permission), which serves for registering offense points and as a temporary licence if the primary licence has been seized by the authorities for serious traffic offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gai.ru|title=ГАИ РУ - Информационный портал: автомобильные новости, оплата штрафов ГИБДД - Форум автомобилистов - Справочная информация для автовладельцев|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supplement has been abolished and reinstated a countless number of times as the views of the traffic police change.

The legal driving age within the Russian Federation is 18 years (16 for motorcycles and 20 for buses)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weheart.moscow/driving/#sel=15:1,15:15|title=Driving in Moscow – Russian road rules|work=We heart Moscow|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to obtain a licence one must be physically fit to drive (including certificates of mental fitness and no record of [[substance abuse]]). One must also pass a test administered at a local traffic police authority and pay a fee. Tests are divided into theory and practice. The theory test is usually a computerized multiple-choice test on various [[traffic rules]]. Twenty multiple-choice questions are asked, only two incorrect answers allowed for a passing grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gai.ru/PermisDeConduire/pdd/|title=Бесплатный онлайн экзамен ПДД 2015, тест на вождение онлайн скачать, сдать экзамены в ГИБДД - ГАИ РУ|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A road test is then administered which includes a demonstration of basic driving skills (steering, slope starting for [[manual transmission]] vehicles and backing-up), [[obstacle course]] as well as a skills examination for road driving. Four minor errors are allowed for the road driving examination—the obstacle course is pass-fail. The number of retries is unlimited.

==== Switzerland ====
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2016}}

Even though Switzerland is a [[EFTA]] member state, it is not a member of the [[European Economic Area]]. Switzerland has, however, generally adopted much of the harmonised EU legislation with regard to driving licences. Swiss licences can be exchanged in most EEA countries. Switzerland has, since the 2000s, used the EU system of vehicle categories and issued EEA-style credit-card licences.

To apply for a car driving licence (category B), the applicant must be 18 years old. They must first attend first aid courses, and pass an eyesight test. Passing a theory exam is required to receive a [[learner's permit]] valid for two years. This allows holders to drive a car only if accompanied by an adult aged 23 or more who has had a full driving licence for a minimum of three years. Before passing the practical exam, the candidate must attend 10 hours of theory lessons on &quot;sensibilisation (familiarisation) to road traffic&quot;. Practical driving lessons are not legally required, but are considered a ''de facto'' prerequisite for passing the practical exam taken with a government official Driving Test Examiner. Upon succeeding the practical exam, a probationary driving licence is issued for three years. To obtain the full, unlimited, driving licence after these three years, the candidate must not commit a serious traffic offence, and attend two days of further driving training.

For motorcycles and heavier vehicles, the regulations are different, and some agrarian vehicles can be driven without a licence. As of 2011, a 45-minute driving lesson costs around {{currency|90|CHF}}, while the various fees and theoretical instruction costs associated with getting a car driving licence can amount to up to {{currency|600|CHF}}, without counting the costs for the two days of further training.

The theoretical exam must be taken in either German, French or Italian. In some cantons it is possible to take it in English.

==== Turkey ====
{{Main|Driving licence in Turkey}}
[[Turkey]] has been an [[Ankara Agreement|associate member]] since 1963, and [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|application to accede to the European Economic Community]], the predecessor of the [[European Union]] (EU), was made on 14 April 1987. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-turkey-relations/article-129678|accessdate=26 August 2008|title=EU-Turkey relations|work=European Information on Enlargement &amp; Neighbours|publisher=EurActiv.com|date=23 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey signed a [[European Union–Turkey Customs Union|Customs Union agreement]] with the EU in 1995 and was officially recognised as a [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|candidate for full membership]] on 12 December 1999, at the [[Helsinki]] summit of the [[European Council]].

On 1st January 2016 new Turkish laws concerning driving licences were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://kalkan.turkishlocalnews.com/portal/kalkan-news/466622-changes-to-turkish-driving-licence-laws-affect-expats&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ehliyet-yenileme-randevu-islemleri-nasil-yapilir-40058464&lt;/ref&gt; The changes are intended to bring Turkey more in line with existing EU driving regulations and concern all road users in Turkey. A foreign national can drive in Turkey with an EU license for 6 months. After 6 months he/she has to change it to a Turkish licence. Application can be made to any Traffic Registration office, and the foreign driving licences will not be returned to holders.  Instead they will be sent to the issuing authority of the country of origin i.e. for British nationals, DVLA. The DVLA says that expats can drive in the UK on a Turkish licence for up to 12 months, and if they wish to settle back in the UK, the Turkish license can be exchanged for a UK license. &lt;ref&gt;http://kalkan.turkishlocalnews.com/portal/kalkan-news/466622-changes-to-turkish-driving-licence-laws-affect-expats&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkey you must be at least 18 years old in order to drive a car and at least 17 to drive a motorbike. The driving test comprises a practical and theory test, which has been recently made tougher in order to meet European Union regulations. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.justlanded.com/english/Turkey/Turkey-Guide/Travel-Leisure/Driving-license&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
{{Main|Driver's licence in Canada}}

The age to obtain a driver's license in Canada varies by province, as do the necessary procedures. The minimum age for obtaining a driver's license to drive unaccompanied in most provinces is 18.

==== Caribbean ====

In Barbados, a person 16 years or over can apply for a Learner's Permit which allows them to drive for a specified period with an accompanying tutor. During that period they will be tested on their driving skill and their knowledge of road signs and traffic laws. On passing both the written and driving test the license is issued. Once issued a driver's license is valid for a period of one to five years depending on which period of time the driver chooses to pay for. On the expiry of the period for which the license is issued, it will become renewable on the last day of the driver's birth month and will again be valid for the time period for which payment is made. Visitors and non-nationals who are the holders of a valid driver's license issued in their country of residence or origin are not allowed to drive automatically in Barbados but must go to a police station to have a temporary local driver's license issued. The license is issued on payment of a fee and the production of the visitor's existing license.

==== Costa Rica ====

Every vehicle driver must carry a driver's license (''Licencia de Conducir''), which is issued by COSEVI (Consejo de Seguridad Vial) of the ministry of transportation and public infrastructure (''Ministerio de Obras Públicas y Transporte'').

For this license to be granted there are three needed tests, practical driving (includes driving a car in simulated streets), theoretical driving (a multiple selection written test based on booklet issued by the education department or after taking a special course), and finally a medical test performed by a medical practitioner that tests eyesight, blood pressure and attests the presence of other diseases and behavior of the driver.

Every citizen can solicit a driver's license at age 18, after being issued the first time, the license must be renewed after two years, and every successive occasion after five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csv.go.cr/servicios/licencias.html |title=Costos de Licencia de Conducir |publisher=Csv.go.cr |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners may also obtain a drivers' license if they have residency.

Besides this document the driver must carry the national identity card (''Cédula de Identidad''), however both documents use the same identification number, the national identity card being the basis of the driver's license number.

==== El Salvador ====

All driver's licenses are given by the government agency SERTRACEN (Servicios de Tránsito Centroamericanos S.A. de C.V.).

One needs a minimum of 15 years to receive a driver's license (a juvenile license).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sertracen.com.sv/licencias-mainmenu-68/tramites-de-licencias-mainmenu-69/primera-vez-mainmenu-80|title=Primera Vez|author=Carlos Josue Quinteros Berrios|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get a new license, one needs to pass a vision test, a written test, and a driving test. These tests are given at accredited driving schools. Foreigners with a license from another country can obtain an El Salvador license if they have residency. They will also have to pass a vision test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sertracen.com.sv/licencias-mainmenu-68/tramites-de-licencias-mainmenu-69/revalidacion-de-licencias-extranjeras-mainmenu-165?task=view|title=404|author=Carlos Josue Quinteros Berrios|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver's license number is the same as the person's Tax ID number.

El Salvador licenses (as well as vehicle circulation cards) contain a chip which can be read by putting the card in a chip reader.

There are several categories of drivers' licenses in El Salvador:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sertracen.com.sv/licencias-mainmenu-68/clases-de-licencia-mainmenu-82|title=Clases de Licencia|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Juvenil Particular—License for minors, allowing them to drive cars and pickup trucks
* Motociclista—Motorcycle license
* Particular—License for adults, for cars, vans up to 17 passengers, and pickup trucks.
* Liviana—Taxis, Light trucks up to 5 tons, and buses up to 30 passengers.
* Pesada—Buses greater than 30 passengers, and trucks greater than 5 tons.
* Pesada T—Trucks with more than 3 axles.

==== Jamaica ====

A citizen may obtain a learner's permit once he or she is age 17. A learner will get their driver's license upon being proven competent, only through the results of both a written and practical test. This license expires on the holder's fifth birthday after the date of issue.

==== Mexico ====
{{Main|Driving licence in Mexico}}

Driving licenses in Mexico are regulated by each state, and they all have different rules and requirements. However, all state driving licenses are recognized across Mexico, and international licenses with an IDP are also recognized as well.

A driver is allowed a learner's permit at the age of 15 (in some states), with the cost of approximately 100 dollars, a duration of a year, and requiring to drive with an adult at all times. At the age of 16, the fee drops to 30 dollars, and a driving permit is issued with some usage restrictions, depending on the state (like a curfew). When a driver turns 18, he or she is allowed a full license.

==== United States ====
{{Main|Driver's license in the United States}}

The eligible age to first obtain a driver's license varies substantially from state to state, from 14 years, three months, in South Dakota to 17 or 18 in New Jersey. In a majority of states one can obtain a license that allows driving without adult supervision by age 16, after passing the requisite tests. Since the driver's license is a commonplace document that carries much of the necessary information needed for identification, it has become the primary [[identity documents in the United States|method of identification in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=US Immigration Support: Your Guide to US Visas, Green Cards, and Citizenship|title=US Drivers License Application|url=https://www.usimmigrationsupport.org/drivers-license-application.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a holder of a driver's license is typically legally allowed to operate a motor vehicle up to 26,001 pounds, if not carrying hazardous materials or more than 16 passengers (driver included). Most jurisdictions when granting driver licenses only permit the holder to operate a road worthy four or more wheeled vehicle. To operate a two-wheel motorized vehicle with a sustainable speed greater than {{Convert|30|mph|abbr=on}} requires an endorsement upon the license, typically after successful completion of a theory and practical test.

On the federal level, motor vehicles with a curb weight of GCWR of {{Convert|26001|lb|abbr=on}} or more, a vehicle designed to transport 16 or more passengers (driver included), or a vehicle transporting hazardous materials can only be driven by an operator carrying a Commercial Driver License (Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986). Upon successful completion of theory and practical testing, endorsements can be applied to a CDL to allow legal transport of specialty types of goods:

* T [[Semi trailer]] Double or Triple (Written Test)
** Certain states prohibit triple trailers statewide, such as California,&lt;ref name=&quot;ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/cdl_htm/toc.htm |title=California Commercial Driver Handbook |accessdate=2006-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=778&amp;section=Appendix%20C&amp;section_toc=108400 |title=Appendix C to Part 658 |accessdate=2008-02-04 |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New York&lt;ref name=&quot;ny&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.ny.gov/broch/cdlmanual.htm |title=New York State Commercial Driver's Manual |accessdate=2006-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A Class A license is required to obtain the T endorsement
* P [[Bus|Passenger Vehicle]] (Written and Driving Tests)
* S [[School Bus]] (Written and Driving Test, Background Check, Sex Offender Registry Check and P endorsement)
* N [[Tank Truck]] (Written Test)
* H [[Hazardous materials]] (Written Test and Background Check through the [[Transportation Security Administration]])
* X Combination of Tank Vehicle and Hazardous Materials (Written Test)
* W Tow truck. (Written Test)
* M Motorcycle License (Written Test and practical)

Various state statues also mandate that CDL must be held to operate vehicles not covered by federal statues.

==== Australia ====
{{Main|Driver's licence in Australia}}

The minimum driving age varies between 16 and 18 years of age in different [[states and territories of Australia|States and Territories]]. After the minimum age, a graduated licensing scheme operates, with state variations.

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main|Driving licence in New Zealand}}
Since August 2011, the minimum age to obtain a learner licence is 16 years old in New Zealand; formerly it was 15 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10723585 |title=Driving age to rise to 16 |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cook Islands====
Cook Islands driving licenses are issued at police headquarters on [[Rarotonga]], on production of a valid license from the visitor's home country. To use a scooter or motor cycle (the main hire vehicles for tourists) a short test has to be taken by anyone whose home license is only valid for cars, in which a police officer observes the applicant riding up and down the main street of the capital.

=== South America ===

==== Brazil ====
{{Main|Driving licence in Brazil}}

==== Peru ====

The minimum age for a driving license is 18 years old. It is obtained via a test in a car, a computer and the applicant must present a vision test which says they are permitted to drive

== Organ donations ==

Licensing bureaus in many countries add an organ donation option on license forms. Sometimes a small picture of a heart or the term ''Organ Donor'' is printed on the driver's license, to indicate that he/she has agreed to donate his/her organs in case of a sudden death, such as in a car accident.

In the United States, this is governed by the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]]. In New Zealand and Republic of Ireland, willingness to donate organs for transplant is also listed on driver's licenses. In Australia, the system of notating organ donation requests on licenses was replaced in July 2005 with a national registration system and the issue of special cards. In the United Kingdom (England, Wales and Scotland) Code &quot;115&quot; is printed on the reverse of the licence to indicate your details are on the NHS Organ Donor Register.

== International and interstate considerations ==

Many groups of countries have agreed to recognize driver's licenses issued by authorities of any of its members. Examples include the European Union and the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]], where holders of driver's licenses issued by any member state can drive in all member states. Most countries worldwide will also recognize the licenses of citizens of foreign states wishing to drive as visitors. All EU member countries now issue licenses in a standard format, regardless of the language of the license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/home/drivinglicence/legislation/index_en.htm |title=Transport - Driving license |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2003-10-22 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Driving Permit]] (IDP) (sometimes erroneously called the ''International Driver's License'') is a booklet which is an authorized translation of a driver's home license into many languages (especially languages with non-Latin scripts such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], etc.). In some cases, it is obtained from a motoring organization such as the [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] or the equivalent in the driver's home country. In other cases, it is delivered by the same government services that deliver ordinary licenses. The IDP has no validity except when used in conjunction with the driver's own license. The existence of the IDP is necessitated by many countries refusing to recognize driver's licenses written in foreign languages without accompanying translations.

Temporary visitors from the United States to France (less than 90 days) are permitted to drive with a valid US state driver's license. In addition to holding a US driver's license, visitors are advised (but not required) to carry an International Driving permit, or attach a French translation to their US state driver's license.

China, at present, does not recognize IDPs and requires drivers to get an additional Chinese license before being officially allowed on all roads. Holders of foreign licenses are exempt from certain requirements when obtaining a Chinese license.

A minimum driving age often exists regardless of possession of a foreign license; an American cannot drive below the local minimum age in Europe, nor can a 17-year-old Briton drive in mainland Europe where the minimum age is 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/living-in-france#driving-licences-and-vehicles|title=Living in France|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have established a ''driver's license exchange arrangement'' after reviews of the foreign jurisdiction's licensing processes. Where standards in the other jurisdiction are comparable in areas such as medical standards, minimum driving age, and knowledge and road testing, an exchange (or honoring) of the foreign jurisdiction's license may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2006/02/22/c0061.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html |accessdate=2016-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822173508/http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2006/02/22/c0061.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html |archivedate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may also be called Driver's License Reciprocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;info.sos.state.tx.us&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&amp;app=9&amp;p_dir=&amp;p_rloc=&amp;p_tloc=&amp;p_ploc=&amp;pg=1&amp;p_tac=&amp;ti=37&amp;pt=1&amp;ch=15&amp;rl=91 |title= Texas Administrative Code |publisher=Info.sos.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Issues when moving permanently from one country or one state to another ===

Most license-issuing authorities require holders of foreign licenses taking up residence in their jurisdiction to obtain a local driver's license within a limited time, typically 6 months or 1 year. In most cases, the driver must follow the full local procedure for obtaining a license, but some jurisdictions have mutual recognition agreements and will exchange the foreign license for a local one without the need to undertake an additional driving test.

An exception is the EU, where licenses do not need to be exchanged since the introduction of the common EU-driver's-license scheme.

==== Australia ====
Each state in Australia has different rules for how long a visitor can drive on an international licence or a licence from a different state. For example, New South Wales allows three months&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.driverknowledgetests.com/learners-permit/driving-on-a-foreign-licence-in-australia.php |title=Driving on a foreign licence in New South Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Victoria allows six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.living-in-melbourne.com/Driver-licence-or-Driving-in-melbourne.html |title=Driving on a foreign licence in Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers that move permanently to another state must change their licence to a local state licence within the prescribed time. This is usually free. In some states, drivers with a full New Zealand licence are treated as interstate drivers.

==== Canada ====

[[British Columbia]] has a reciprocal license exchange scheme with other Canadian provinces and territories as well other countries provided the license is valid or has been expired for less than three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icbc.com/licensing/lic_renew_replace_new.asp |title=ICBC - Driver licensing |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928154346/http://www.icbc.com/licensing/lic_renew_replace_new.asp |archive-date=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====

US state driver's licenses can be exchanged from the 15 states below during the first year of legal residence in France: [[Arkansas]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Florida]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Maryland]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]] and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfe.org/index.php/Thematiques/Demarches-administratives/Permis-de-conduire-etranger-Echange-en-France |title=Permis de conduire étranger - Echange en France |publisher=Maison des Français de l'étranger (MFE) |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are a resident of France (holder of a carte de séjour or carte de residence), you may drive in France with a valid US state driver's license for a one-year recognition period, beginning on the date of validity of the first carte de séjour (exception for students who are allowed to use their driver's license for the duration of their studies). In addition to having s US state driver's license, residents are also required to attach a French translation done by a sworn translator, or ''expert traducteur'' or ''traducteur assermenté''.

==== Germany ====

The US Embassy, supported by the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, continues to actively press all US states, territories, and the federal district to reach an agreement on the reciprocal recognition of driver's licenses with Germany, essentially a waiver of testing requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://germany.usembassy.gov/acs/drivers_license/|title=American Driver’s License - Germany - United States Diplomatic Mission|publisher=|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
A foreigner 18 years of age or older and holding a Work Pass/Dependent Pass/Student Pass may drive in Singapore with a valid class 3, 3A or 2B foreign license, for a period of not more than 12 months. A [[Driving in Singapore#Driving licence|Singaporean driving licence]] is required after 12 months. Those on short term social visits may drive with their foreign license for up to 12 months each time they enter into Singapore. For licences not written in the English language, an International Driving Permit or translation is required.

Foreign licence conversion is only granted for class 2B and class 3 qualified driving licences.

In order to convert your foreign licence to a Singapore driving licence, you are required to pass the Basic Theory Test (BTT). Overseas theory test results are not admissible for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/information_drivinglicence_conversion.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sweden ====

Residents in Sweden having a foreign license can exchange it to a Swedish license, if it is from an EU country, an [[European Economic Area|EEA]] country, Switzerland or Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korkortsportalen.se/upload/dokument/Ovriga_dokument_TS/International/engelska.pdf |title=Foreign Driver's Licences |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign licenses are valid if the holder has not been living in Sweden for more than a year (and some more requirements).

==== United Kingdom ====

The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which licenses drivers in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), but not Northern Ireland, exchanges full licenses issued by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Diol1/MotoringDecisionTrees/HowToImportorExportaVehicle/exchange_driving_licence.dsb |title=Directgov *'exchange driving licence' interactive tool |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Countries within the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] and Switzerland,
* The [[Crown dependencies|British Crown dependencies]] (Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man)
* Gibraltar and other British Overseas Territories,
* Australia, Barbados, the Faroe Islands, Hong Kong, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.
* Canada (by default, Canadian driver's licenses will only be exchanged for licenses to drive automatic transmission cars, unless documentary evidence is provided that a manual shift test was passed in Canada)

==== United States ====
A Driver's License from any US state is valid for temporary use in any other US state, although most states require that a person have a license issued by their state of primary residence. Most states allow residents to convert an out-of-state license to an in-state license without any additional written or road tests.

[[Delaware]] has a reciprocal license exchange for Germany, France, and Taiwan to allow holders of those licenses to obtain a Delaware license without any additional written or road tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.de.gov/services/driver_services/faqs/dr_faq_over18.shtml |title=State of Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles - Driver's License Over 18 FAQ's |publisher=Dmv.de.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[District of Columbia]] driver's license may be obtained while maintaining out-of-country driver's license. D.C. driver's licenses may vary for non-US citizens, depending on visa classification. The written test is required for non-US citizens who possess an out-of-country driver's license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.dc.gov/serv/dlicense/get_non_us_citizen_convert.shtm |title=District of Columbia: Department of Motor Vehicles - Services - Drivers' Licenses - Getting Your Learners' Permit |publisher=Dmv.dc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Florida]] has a reciprocal license agreement with South Korea, allowing South Korea licenses to be exchanged for a Florida license, and vice versa, without taking a written or road test.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flhsmv.gov/news/pdfs/PR102111.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[New York (state)|New York State]] driver's license may be obtained by a resident of another country. If the driver has a driver license from any nation except Canada, they must pass a written test, complete a 5-hour pre-licensing course and pass a road test to qualify for a driver's license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/license.htm#driversfromothernations |title=New York State Department of Motor Vehicles - NYS DMV - NYSDMV - Driver - Vehicle |publisher=Nydmv.state.ny.us |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Texas]] doesn't require drivers from Canada, France, Germany, nor Taiwan to take the written and practical tests. But drivers must still agree to a vision test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/DriverLicense/movingtotexas.html |title=Texas Department of Public Safety |publisher=xdps.state.tx.us |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Get WA license |publisher=Dol.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virginia]] has a reciprocal agreement with Canada, France and Germany. The knowledge and skills tests may be waived if the driver meets residency and other requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.virginia.gov/webdoc/pdf/dmv141.pdf |title=Department of Motor Vehicles Virginia|publisher=dmv.virginia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
