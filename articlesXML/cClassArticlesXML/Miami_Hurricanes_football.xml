The Hurricanes compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA)'s [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) and the [[Coastal Division]] of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC). The program began in 1926 and has won five [[AP Poll|AP national championships]] ([[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|1983]], [[1987 Miami Hurricanes football team|1987]], [[1989 Miami Hurricanes football team|1989]], [[1991 Miami Hurricanes football team|1991]], [[2001 Miami Hurricanes football team|2001]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring2007/featurestory5.html |title=Born and Bred|last=Jones Jr.|first=Robert C.|year=2007|work=Miami: The University of Miami Magazine|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miami is ranked fourth on the list of All-time Associated Press National Poll Championships, tied with [[USC Trojans football|Southern California]] and [[Ohio State]] and behind [[Alabama Crimson Tide Football|Alabama]], [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]],  and [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2015/fbs.pdf|title=Football Bowl Subdivision Records |work=NCAA|page=117|accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team plays its home games at [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in Miami Gardens, Florida. The Hurricanes are currently coached by [[Mark Richt]].

==History==

===Beginnings (1926–1936)===
UM began with just a freshman football team in 1926. Its first game was played on October 23, [[1926 college football season|1926]], a 7–0 win over [[Rollins College]] before 304 fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=2007 University of Miami Football Media Guide|year=2007|pages=??|url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/07-media-guide.html |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guidance of head coach [[Howard P. Buck]], the freshman team posted a perfect 8–0 record in its inaugural season. Two of the wins were against the [[University of Havana]],&lt;ref name=mg158&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mifl/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/08-mg-157-196.pdf|title=2008 UM Football Media Guide |page=158|accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; one on Thanksgiving Day in Miami and one at Havana on Christmas Day. Miami's last home game at of the season featured a first: the first Hurricane football game played on New Year's Day against [[Samford University|Howard]] at Miami's University Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZUAuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WNgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4042,5369512&amp;dq=miami+hurricanes+football&amp;hl=en ]{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the team adopted the official nickname &quot;Hurricanes&quot;, though the exact timing and origin of the name is unclear; some reports suggest it was in reference to the devastating power of the [[1926 Miami hurricane|1926 hurricane]] that postponed the program's first game by a month, and others that it was suggested by a player in response to rumors that university officials wanted to name the team after local [[flora]] or [[fauna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;team name&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/trads/mifl-name.html|title=Team Name and Logo|work=HurricaneSports.com University website|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varsity competition began in 1927, with Miami beating Rollins 39–3 in its first game and going on to a 3–6–1 record. The team improved to 4–4–1 in [[1928 college football season|1928]], but it was not enough for Buck to keep his job, and he was replaced prior to the [[1929 college football season|1929 season]] with [[J. Burton Rix]], previously head coach at [[Southern Methodist Mustangs football|Southern Methodist]].&lt;ref name=mg158/&gt;  Rix's arrival was funded by a group of local businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/043002aaa.html|title=Material from the book &quot;Hurricane Watch&quot;|first=Jim|last=Martz|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; That off-season, the program, which competed as an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] during its first two years of existence, joined the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA). 1929 saw Miami play its first varsity road game (a 14–0 loss at [[Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns football|Southwest Louisiana]]), and Rix led the team to its first winning season, going 3–2.&lt;ref name=mg158/&gt;  His tenure, however, was short-lived; off-campus financing for the program dried up in the wake of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]], and he resigned after one season.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;

[[Ernest E. Brett|Ernest Brett]] replaced Rix, and in [[1930 college football season|1930]], Miami played [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] in its first game outside [[Southern United States|the South]], losing 34–0 to the Owls in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=mg158/&gt;  
On October 31, 1930, the Hurricanes played in one of the nation's first night games vs. Bowden College in Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:vArEOz9DKokJ:grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mifl/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/fb-09-mg-pdf-7.pdf+burdine+stadium+first+night+game&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgKYaf_MV7ZRmB2STDxGdzBwqExPB2BLxChTrDeO8jjXjzpsa1bl49k1st8Z4nFOmboHIvyYNazOO4oBi-hdOnPBrXOKpmGcsEKfy6sVV-rlCzRmY0SCURvLQFCg21eAU2nnq7I&amp;sig=AHIEtbRdIAjowyHAVDe0XZH5gD6qFAJicA |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com|accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett only lasted one year, and [[Tom McCann]] became the program's fourth head coach in 1931.

Under McCann, the football program experienced its most successful seasons to that point. After a difficult first year, Miami put together a winning [[1932 college football season|record in 1932]] and served as host to the inaugural [[Orange Bowl#Palm Festival|Palm Festival]] (later to be known as the [[Orange Bowl]]), defeating [[Manhattan College]] 7–0 at Moore Park in Miami.&lt;ref name=mg158/&gt; A 5–1–2 campaign and another Palm Festival berth followed in [[1933 college football season|1933]], and in [[1934 college football season|1934]], the program played in its first official [[bowl game]], losing to [[Bucknell Bison|Bucknell]] in the first Orange Bowl, 26–0.&lt;ref name=mg158/&gt;

In 1935, a group of Miami football supporters sought to hire [[Red Grange]] as coach. However, the move was vetoed by President [[Bowman Foster Ashe]], in part because of the $7,500 salary that Grange had requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.library.miami.edu/umhistory/DisplaySubjects.php?DisplayPages&amp;subject_id=Athletics&amp;current_page=1|title=University of Miami Legacy Images |accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead [[Irl Tubbs]] took over as head coach in 1935, and though Miami compiled an 11–5–2 record in his two seasons, it did not play in a bowl in either year.&lt;ref name=mg165&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mifl/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/08-mg-157-196.pdf|title=2008 UM Football Media Guide|page=165|accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jack Harding era (1937–1947)===
After [[Irl Tubbs]] resigned following the [[1936 college football season|1936 season]] to become head coach at [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]], [[Jack Harding]] was hired to serve as both head football coach and [[athletic director]] at Miami.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;

In 1937, the Hurricanes moved into the brand new [[Miami Orange Bowl|Burdine Municipal Stadium]] (renamed the Orange Bowl in 1959), located west of downtown [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt; The following year, Miami played archrival [[1938 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] for the first time, defeating the Gators 19–7 at [[Florida Field]], and won the program's first [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] title with an 8–2 record. The Hurricanes, though, left the SIAA just three years later, becoming an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] once again.

Harding led the Hurricanes to eight- and seven- win campaigns in 1941 and 1942, respectively, before he was called away by World War II service.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;  [[Eddie Dunn]], a former star running back at Miami under Harding, stepped into the void and served as head coach during Harding's two-year war service. Though the Hurricanes won five games in Dunn's first season, they faltered in the second, winning just one game against seven losses and a tie.

Fortunes changed with Harding's return in 1945, as the Hurricanes went 9–1–1 and returned to the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for the first time since 1934, defeating [[Holy Cross Crusaders football|Holy Cross]] 13–6 in a memorable game.&lt;ref name=&quot;1946 orange bowl&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/sports/obspecial/story1.html|title=Plenty of Memories |last=Pope|first=Edwin|date=2007-11-10|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the score tied 6–6 and only seconds remaining, Holy Cross quarterback Gene DeFilippo was intercepted by Miami's Al Hudson at the 11-yard line. Hudson dashed 89 yards the other way for the game-winning touchdown as time expired.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1946 orange bowl&quot;/&gt;

Harding's Hurricanes won eight games in 1946, but after the team slipped to 2–7–1 in 1947, he resigned as head coach, but continued as Athletic Director. He hired [[Andy Gustafson]] as the new head coach, closing out a nine-year tenure in which Miami went 54–29–3 and won at least 8 games in four different seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;

===Andy Gustafson era (1948–1963)===
{{Main article|1962 Miami Hurricanes football team}}
One of [[Andy Gustafson]]'s major innovations at Miami was the &quot;drive series&quot; offense, an [[option offense|option-oriented attack]] from the [[Split-T]] formation that relied on [[zone blocking]] and featured either a [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] fake or carry on every play.&lt;ref name=&quot;gustafson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1069459/1/index.htm|title=Drive at Miami: Coach Andy Gustafson has the system and the men |last=Hickman|first=Herman |date=1955-04-11|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1069462/index.htm|title=The Theory Of The Drive Series|last=Hickman|first=Herman|date=1955-04-11|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Gustafson's tutelage, Miami produced its first [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]], Al Carapella, in 1950 and went 9–1–1 in [[1951 college football season|1951]], including a 35–13 win in its first-ever game against rival [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] and a 15–14 loss to [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] in the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bowl history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/010204aaa.html|title=Miami Bowl History|work=HurricaneSports.com|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[1952 college football season|following season]], Miami won eight games and went to a bowl game in consecutive years for the first time in school history, shutting out Clemson 14–0 in a rematch at the [[Gator Bowl]].

In the middle of the [[1954 college football season|1954 season]], the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] imposed two one-year [[NCAA probation|penalties]] against Miami for providing transportation and tryouts to prospective players.&lt;ref name=&quot;gustafson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=prob1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19561114&amp;id=6SYTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0QQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6999,3305992 |title=Arbitrary, To Say The Least – Harding |first=Associated Press |date=1956-11-14 |work=[[Ocala Star-Banner]] |accessdate=2009-10-13 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, Gustafson's 1954 squad was ineligible to play in a [[bowl game]], and the 8–1 Hurricanes, whose lone loss came 14–13 at No. 14 [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]], finished the season ranked ninth in the [[Coaches' Poll#College football|Coaches' Poll]], the first top ten poll finish in school history.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gustafson&quot;/&gt;  Two years later, an 8–1–1 Miami team, led by team captain and All-American [[Don Bosseler]], was under consideration to play in the [[Sugar Bowl]], but the program's bowl-ban was not due to expire until ten days after the game, rendering it ineligible to participate.&lt;ref name=prob1/&gt;  The team finished the season ranked sixth in both the [[AP Poll|AP]] and Coaches' Polls.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;

In the later years of Gustafson's tenure, two-time All-America quarterback [[George Mira]] guided the Hurricanes to berths in the [[1961 college football season|1961]] [[Liberty Bowl]] and the [[1962 college football season|1962]] [[Gotham Bowl]], where they lost both games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/sports/ncaafootball/20bowls.html|title=Paying Homage to Visions of Bowl Games Gone By|last=Reisler|first=Jim|date=2007-12-20|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmbolding.com/bowls/Liberty_1961.htm|title=Liberty Bowl 1961: Syracuse 15, Miami 14|last=Sheehan|first=Joseph|date=1961-12-16|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1963 college football season|1963]], the team struggled to a 3–7 record.

===Kichefski, Curci, Elliot, and Selmer eras (1970–1976)===
[[Walt Kichefski]], an assistant on Tate's staff, was elevated to interim head coach in the wake of Tate's resignation and coached the team to a 3–8 record in 1970. He was not retained the following season and [[Fran Curci]], a former [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] quarterback under [[Andy Gustafson]], was chosen as the program's new head coach. Curci's 1971 team improved by a game, but rival [[1971 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] defeated Miami in a game that came to be known as &quot;the Florida Flop.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;florida rivalry1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?id=1609982|title=Florida–Miami rivalry has bitter history|date=2003-09-05|work=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Florida leading 45–8 late in the fourth quarter, the Gator defense allowed Miami to score so that Florida would get the ball back and quarterback [[John Reaves]] would have the opportunity to gain the 15 yards he needed to break the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] record for career passing yards.&lt;ref name=cm4&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Bruce|title=Cane Mutiny: How the Miami Hurricanes Overturned the Football Establishment|publisher=[[New American Library]]|location=New York|year=2004|page=4|isbn=0-451-21297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[1972 college football season|1972]] brought another memorable finish for Miami, when the inadvertent gift of a &quot;fifth down&quot; by officials enabled the Hurricanes to edge [[Tulane Green Wave football|Tulane]] in the waning moments of the game for a 24–21 win.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulanegreenwave.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/history.html|title=Tulane Football History|work=TulaneGreenWave.com|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/sports/view-of-sport-fifth-down-or-not-it-s-over-when-it-s-over.html|title=Fifth Down or Not, It's Over When It's Over|last=Nelson|first=David M.|date=1990-10-14|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Curci left the program at the conclusion of the season and was replaced by [[Pete Elliot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt; Elliot, in turn, lasted two seasons and stepped down in 1975 to become Miami's [[athletic director]].

===Lou Saban era (1977–1978)===
After a national search, [[Lou Saban]], formerly head coach of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Denver Broncos]], and [[Boston Patriots]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt; was hired on December 27, 1976, as head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--need page cite--&gt;

Miami only won three games in [[1977 college football season|1977]], but Saban was able to put together a well-regarded recruiting class that included future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Jim Kelly]] of [[East Brady, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;  Kelly had been recruited by [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] as a [[linebacker]] and agreed to come to Miami after Saban promised him he would play quarterback.&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;  Among the other 30 signees in Saban's first recruiting class were 11 future NFL players.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--need page cite--&gt;

The Hurricanes improved by three games in Saban's second season and [[Ottis Anderson]] emerged as an NFL talent. Anderson became the first Miami running back to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and led the team in rushing for three straight seasons from 1977 through 1979.

At the outset of his tenure, [[Howard Schnellenberger]] announced to his staff and players his intention to win a [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championship]] within five years.&lt;ref name=cm19&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Bruce|title=Cane Mutiny: How the Miami Hurricanes Overturned the Football Establishment|publisher=[[New American Library]]|location=New York|year=2004|page=19|isbn=0-451-21297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His five-year plan had two main priorities: installing a [[Pro Style|pro-style]] passing offense and upgrading the talent level on the roster through a new recruiting strategy aimed at retaining the best local talent.&lt;ref name=cm22/&gt; To help with the offense, Schnellenberger hired former [[Baltimore Colts]] quarterback [[Earl Morrall]] as a volunteer quarterbacks coach.&lt;ref name=cm22/&gt;  On the recruiting front, he spoke of mining the &quot;State of Miami&quot;, which entailed fencing off the fertile [[South Florida]] recruiting base from other programs and cherry-picking the rest of the nation for a few choice recruits.&lt;ref name=cm24&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Bruce|title=Cane Mutiny: How the Miami Hurricanes Overturned the Football Establishment|publisher=[[New American Library]]|location=New York|year=2004|page=24|isbn=0-451-21297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schnellenberger also sought to exploit the freedom provided by Miami's [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] schedule to gain &quot;intersectional exposure&quot; and make the program &quot;national.&quot;&lt;ref name=cm22&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Bruce|title=Cane Mutiny: How the Miami Hurricanes Overturned the Football Establishment|publisher=[[New American Library]]|location=New York|year=2004|page=22|isbn=0-451-21297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the field, Miami went 5–6 in Schnellenberger's debut season, which was highlighted by a 26–10 upset win at No. 16 [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]] in which [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] freshman [[Jim Kelly]] threw for 280 yards and three touchdowns in his first career start as Miami's quarterback.&lt;ref name=cm31&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Bruce|title=Cane Mutiny: How the Miami Hurricanes Overturned the Football Establishment|publisher=[[New American Library]]|location=New York|year=2004|page=31|isbn=0-451-21297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schnellenberger set a bowl berth as the goal of the [[1980 Miami Hurricanes football team|1980 campaign]] and the team made good on its head coach's expectations, winning nine games and earning a trip to the [[Peach Bowl]], where the Hurricanes defeated [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]] 20–10.&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt; The bowl berth was Miami's first since 1967 and the team finished the season ranked eighteenth in both the [[AP Poll|AP]] and [[Coaches' Poll|Coaches']] Polls.

Miami continued to improve in [[1981 NCAA Division I-A football season|1981]], going 9–2 and defeating then-No. 1 Penn State 17–14 in a late-October game at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. In the season's final game, the Hurricanes topped rival [[1981 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] for the first time since 1960, 37–15, finishing the season eighth in the AP Poll. The [[1982 Miami Hurricanes football team|following season]], the team finished with four losses following Kelly's shoulder injury. Entering the [[1983 NCAA Division I-A football season|1983 season]]—the fifth of Schnellenberger's tenure—the program had to find a replacement for the recently graduated Kelly. Ultimately, Schnellenberger chose [[Bernie Kosar]] as the team's starting quarterback over fellow redshirt freshman [[Vinny Testaverde]].

The [[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|1983 Miami Hurricanes]] started the season unranked and lost 28–3 at [[1983 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] in their first game, though Kosar tied [[George Mira]]'s single-game school record of 25 pass completions.&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt; The Hurricanes rallied by winning their next 10 games, including a 20–0 early-season shutout of [[1983 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], and earned a berth to the [[1984 Orange Bowl]] to play the undefeated, top-ranked [[1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] team that had both [[Mike Rozier]] and [[Turner Gill]]. The Orange Bowl-berth was Miami's first since 1951, but the program's first national championship remained a long shot, as the Hurricanes entered the game ranked fifth. Miami got much needed help early on New Year's Day when second-ranked [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]], the nation's other undefeated team, lost in the [[1984 Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl Classic]] and fourth-ranked [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] lost in the [[1984 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1984 orange&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/orange/s/1984.html|title=1984 – Miami 31, Nebraska 30|last=O'Sullivan|first=Dan|date=2002-12-13|work=ABC Sports Online|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind Kosar's passing, Miami jumped out to a 17–0 lead, but Nebraska battled back and cut Miami's lead to 31–24 in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984 orange&quot;/&gt;  With 48 seconds remaining, Nebraska scored a touchdown to make it 31–30 and, being the number one-ranked team in the nation, needed only to kick the extra point to tie the game and put itself in position to win the national championship. Nebraska head coach [[Tom Osborne]] elected to go for the win and attempt a two-point conversion instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984 orange&quot;/&gt;  On the ensuing play, Miami [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] Ken Calhoun tipped away Gill's pass to receiver Jeff Smith in the end zone, saving the game and winning Miami the national championship when it leap-frogged No. 3 [[1983 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] to finish first in the final polls.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984 orange&quot;/&gt;

Although Schnellenberger had made good on his five-year plan to win a national championship, he left after the season to accept a head coaching position in the [[USFL]].&lt;ref name=mediaguide160/&gt;  Two weeks later, athletic director [[Sam Jankovich]] hired [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] away from [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] to fill the vacancy.&lt;ref name=mediaguide160&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mifl/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/08-mg-157-196.pdf|title=2008 UM Football Media Guide|page=160|accessdate=2009-11-20|date=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]'s immediate priorities upon taking over as Miami head coach was to switch to a 4–3 defense.&lt;ref name=cm55/&gt;  Johnson wanted to implement the change for his first season, but lacking the time, personnel, and staff, he decided to postpone the switch and kept Schnellenberger's 5–2 defensive package for the 1984 season.&lt;ref name=cm55&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Bruce|title=Cane Mutiny: How the Miami Hurricanes Overturned the Football Establishment|publisher=[[New American Library]]|location=New York|year=2004|page=55|isbn=0-451-21297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team struggled to an 8–5 record in Johnson's first season, losing a number of noteworthy games. In the next-to-last game of the regular season, the No. 6 Hurricanes squandered a 31–0 halftime lead against [[1984 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]] and lost 42–40 in what was then the biggest comeback in NCAA football history.&lt;ref name=&quot;maryland comeback&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/09/11/biggest-comeback-wins-lifestyle-sports-comebacks.html|title=Sports' Greatest Comeback Wins|last=Burke|first=Monte|date=2009-09-11|work=[[Forbes]].com|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following week, Miami lost 47–45 when [[1984 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College]]'s [[Doug Flutie]] connected with [[Gerard Phelan]] for a 48-yard [[Hail Mary pass|Hail Mary]] touchdown on the final play in what has been called the [[Hail Flutie]] game.&lt;ref name=&quot;flutie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/bio/news/story?page=Flutie_Doug|title=Hail Flutie|last=Schwartz|first=Kris|date=2006-05-18|work=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hurricanes ended the season on a three-game losing streak by dropping the [[1985 Fiesta Bowl]] to [[1984 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]], 39–37, in a game that featured six lead changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985 fiesta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/fiesta/s/1985.html|title=1985 – UCLA 39, Miami 37|last=Burchette|first=Jordan|work=ABCSports.com|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the off-season, Johnson made a number of coaching changes, facilitating the switch to the 4–3 defense, and junior [[Vinny Testaverde]] succeeded early-graduate [[Bernie Kosar]] at quarterback.&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;  The 1985 Hurricanes opened the season with a loss at [[1985 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] before winning their next four games, including a 38–0 win over [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] that began a then NCAA-record 58 game home winning streak, heading into a matchup at No. 3 [[1985 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]]. Facing the nation's top-rated defense, Testaverde amassed 270 yards passing and threw touchdowns to [[Michael Irvin]] and [[Brian Blades]], while also running for an additional score, in a 27–14 win over the Sooners.&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--need page cite--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;miami_oklahoma&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/college-football/article/2007-09-05/its-been-2-decades-and-miami-oklahoma-matchups-still-classic|title=It's been 2 decades, and Miami–Oklahoma matchups still classic|last=Associated Press|date=2007-09-05|work=[[Sporting News|Sporting News.com]]|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hurricanes ascended to number two in the rankings following a 58–7 victory over [[1985 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] in the final game of the regular season, earning a trip to the [[1986 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] to play the No. 8 [[1985 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee Volunteers]]. With No. 1 [[1985 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] losing to Oklahoma in the [[Orange Bowl]], Miami was in position to capture its second [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championship]], but those hopes were dashed with a lopsided 35–7 loss to Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allstatesugarbowl.org/site106.php|title=52nd Annual Sugar Bowl Classic ~ January 1, 1986|work=AllStateSugarBowl.org|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having the support of students, players, and even the Miami police and fire departments, [[offensive coordinator]] [[Gary Stevens (American football)|Gary Stevens]] was bypassed for the head coaching job and athletic director [[Sam Jankovich]] chose [[Dennis Erickson]] of [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]] to succeed [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] instead.&lt;ref name=cm92&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Bruce|title=Cane Mutiny: How the Miami Hurricanes Overturned the Football Establishment|publisher=[[New American Library]]|location=New York|year=2004|isbn=0-451-21297-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1989 NCAA Division I-A football season|1989]], Erickson became just the second [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] head coach to win a [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championship]] in his first season at a school.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1990 sugar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allstatesugarbowl.org/site102.php|title=56th Annual Sugar Bowl Classic ~ January 1, 1990|work=AllStateSugarBowl.org|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Erickson's [[1989 Miami Hurricanes football team|1989 team]], led by [[Craig Erickson]] (no relation) at quarterback, rebounded from a mid-season loss at [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] and moved back into the national championship picture with a 27–10 win over then-top-ranked [[1989 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] in the final regular-season game. Miami's 33–25 win over No. 7 [[1989 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] in the [[Sugar Bowl]], combined with No. 1 [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]]'s loss to Notre Dame in the [[Orange Bowl]], earned the program its third national championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;1990 sugar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/sugar/s/1990.html|title=1990 – Miami 33, Alabama 25|last=Laracy|first=Alex|date=2002-12-13|work=ABCSports.com|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miami entered the [[1990 Miami Hurricanes football team|following season]] as the number one team in the country, but a 28–21 upset loss to [[Ty Detmer]] and No. 16 [[1990 BYU Cougars football team|BYU]] in the opener derailed both the team's national championship chances and Craig Erickson's nascent Heisman campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1136436/index.htm|title=Tying One On: Quarterback Ty Detmer led BYU to a stunning upset of the No. 1 team|last=Hersch|first=Hank|date=1990-09-17|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the year, the Hurricanes lost to [[1990 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] 29–20 in a game dubbed the &quot;Final Conflict&quot;, as Notre Dame had decided to discontinue the 27-game rivalry,&lt;ref name=&quot;nd rivalry1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-18/sports/sp-3904_1_notre-dame|title=Great and Passionate Rivalry Will End Saturday With Miami–Notre Dame Game|date=1990-10-18|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; feeling the intensity of the series had reached an unhealthy level.&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;  Miami ended the season with a 46–3 [[1991 Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl Classic]] victory over No. 3 [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] in the [[1991 Cotton Bowl Classic]] in which the team was penalized a bowl- and school-record 16 times for 202 yards, including nine unsportsmanlike conduct or personal foul penalties.&lt;ref name=&quot;1991 cotton&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/cottonbowl/history/1991.html|title=Hurricanes wreak havoc in Cotton|last=McNabb|first=David|date=1991-01-02|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On one play, [[Randal Hill]] scored on a 48-yard touchdown reception and continued to sprint out of the end zone and up the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] tunnel, where he then pretended to shoot at the Longhorns with imaginary pistols.&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;  The program was widely criticized for its conduct, with [[Will McDonough]] of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' likening the Cotton Bowl Classic display to a &quot;wilding&quot; and [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] calling it &quot;the most disgusting thing [he'd] ever seen in college sports.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;  After the season, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] responded with the so-called &quot;Miami Rule&quot;, which made it a 15-yard penalty to engage in excessive celebration or flagrant taunting.&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-05/sports/sp-2372_1_college-football|title=Upon Further Review, Coach Says Referee Blew the Call|last=Wojciechowski|first=Gene|date=1991-09-05|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also during the off-season, Miami ended its 48-year status as an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] and joined the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]].

The [[1991 Miami Hurricanes football team|1991 Hurricanes]] captured the program's fourth national championship in nine years behind quarterback [[Gino Torretta]] and a linebacking corps that featured [[Jessie Armstead]] and [[Micheal Barrow]]. Miami's toughest test came in mid-November at then-No. 1 [[1991 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] in the initial [[Wide Right I|Wide Right]] game; with the No. 2 Hurricanes leading 17–16 in the final minute of the game, Florida State kicker Gerry Thomas' potential game-winning field goal attempt sailed &quot;wide right&quot; of the uprights.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/17/sports/college-football-miami-wins-17-16-to-capture-all-the-oranges.html|title=Miami Wins, 17–16, to Capture All the Oranges|last=Moran|first=Malcolm|date=1991-11-17|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miami completed the second undefeated season in school history with a 22–0 shutout of No. 11 [[1991 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] in the [[1992 Orange Bowl]] and finished first in the [[AP Poll]], splitting the national championship with [[Coaches' Poll]] champ [[1991 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 media&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--missing page #--&gt;

With the threat of NCAA sanctions hovering over the program for a variety of infractions, Erickson stepped down after the 1994 season to become head coach of the NFL's [[Seattle Seahawks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cane mutiny&quot;/&gt;  Erickson departed Miami with a 63–9 record over six seasons and the highest winning percentage (.875) and most national championships (2) of any coach in school history.&lt;ref name=cm145/&gt;

===Butch Davis era (1995–2000)===
{{See also|1995 Orange Bowl}}
[[File:Butch Davis.jpg|thumb|[[Butch Davis]]]]
Several early candidates to replace [[Dennis Erickson]], including former UM defensive coordinator and 1994 ''Sports Illustrated'' Coach of the Year [[Sonny Lubick]], withdrew from consideration. Eventually, Miami settled on former Hurricanes assistant and [[Dallas Cowboys]] defensive coordinator [[Butch Davis]].

The Hurricanes finished Davis' first season with a record of 8–3, which may have drawn a bowl invitation. However, on December 20, 1995 the NCAA announced that Miami would be subject to severe sanctions for numerous infractions within the athletic department. The Hurricanes were forced to sit out postseason play for the 1995 season and docked 31 scholarships from 1996 to 1998. Miami had actually self-reported the violations in 1991. However, when the Department of Education got word that school officials helped athletes fraudulently obtain [[Pell Grant]]s, it asked Miami to stop its own investigation while it conducted its own. Ultimately, 60 athletes were implicated, but all of them avoided criminal charges after being sent through a pretrial diversion program.&lt;ref name=Fanhouse&gt;Holiday, Pete. [http://www.aolnews.com/2007/07/23/footballs-dirtiest-programs-10-miami Football's Dirtiest Programs: #10, Miami]. [[FanHouse]], 2007-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Tony Russell, a former UM academic advisor, pleaded guilty to helping more than 80 student athletes, 57 of whom were football players, falsify Pell Grant applications in exchange for kickbacks from the players themselves. The scandal dated all the way back to 1989 and secured more than $220,000 in federal grant money. Federal officials later said that Russell had engineered &quot;perhaps the largest centralized fraud ... ever committed&quot; in the history of the Pell Grant program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Why the University of Miami should drop football | accessdate=2006-11-11 | url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1006688/index.htm | publisher=CNNSI.com | date=1995-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Bruce|title=Cane Mutiny: How the Miami Hurricanes Overturned the Football Establishment|publisher=[[New American Library]]|location=New York|year=2004|isbn=0-451-21297-5|pages=131–33, 144, 156–57, 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1995, the NCAA concluded that, in addition to the fraudulent Pell Grants facilitated by Russell, the university had also provided or allowed over $400,000 worth of other, improper payments to Miami football players. The NCAA also found that the university had failed to wholly implement its drug testing program, and permitted three football student-athletes to compete without being subject to the required disciplinary measures specified in the policy.  The NCAA found that this was evidence that school officials didn't have adequate control over the football program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1995 Public Infraction Report | accessdate=2006-11-11 | url=https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&amp;key=63&amp;publicTerms=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED  | publisher=NCAA.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miami docked itself seven scholarships as part of a self-imposed sanction in 1995, and the [[NCAA]] took away another 24 scholarships over the next two years. As a result of the scandal, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Alexander Wolff]] wrote a cover story that Miami should at least temporarily shut down its football program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt; Further, On June 21, 1996, Miami football players broke into the apartment of the captain of Miami's track team and struck him repeatedly. In response, Davis suspended three key players for the coming 1996 season. Davis also suspended two other players who were involved in separate violent incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008584/1/index.htm|title=Though Love: Coach Butch Davis aims to save Miami football no matter how many players he has to suspend|first=William |last=Nack|date=August 19, 1996|accessdate=2009-10-20|work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imposition of scholarship reductions led to a long and sometimes painful rebuilding period for the Hurricanes.

The low point for Miami came in 1997 when they posted a 5–6 record, the first losing season since Howard Schnellenberger's first year in 1979. The 1997 season saw the Hurricanes suffer one of the program's most humiliating losses, a 47–0 beating at the hands of in-state rival [[1997 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1997 fsu1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/100801aau.html|title=Miami–Florida State Rivalry Back to Life|last=Long|first=Mark|date=2001-10-08|work=TheACC.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1997 fsu2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1011123/index.htm|title=Blown-out Hurricanes|last=Maisel|first=Ivan|date=1997-10-13|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hurricanes began to reassert themselves in 1998. In late September, Miami was forced to postpone their game with [[UCLA Bruins Football|UCLA]] due to [[Hurricane Georges]]. The game was rescheduled for December 5 and for the #2-ranked Bruins, a trip to the National Championship game was at stake. The Hurricanes rebounded from a 66–13 &quot;caning&quot; at the hands of Syracuse and Donovan McNabb to put up over 600 yards of total offense against UCLA en route to a stunning 49–45 victory for the Hurricanes.

The following season carried high hopes and expectations for the Hurricanes. They opened the year with a 23–12 win over [[1999 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]]. Early success, however, was tempered by tough losses to [[1999 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] and [[1999 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] during a three-game losing streak. The Hurricanes rebounded to win their last 4 games including a 28–13 win over [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] in the [[Gator Bowl]].

In 2000, Miami was shut out of the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] National Championship Game. Despite beating [[2000 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] head-to-head and being ranked higher in both human polls, the Seminoles were chosen to challenge the [[2000 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]] for the national championship. The Seminoles were also chosen over [[2000 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]], who also had one loss and who had handed Miami its only loss early in the season. Washington had been ranked third or fourth in the human polls, behind Miami. The Hurricanes went into the [[2001 Sugar Bowl|2001 Nokia Sugar Bowl]] as the Big East champions and defeated [[2000 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] 37–20. On January 29, 2001, [[Butch Davis]] left Miami to become head coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]].

Miami started the season with a 33–7, televised win over [[2001 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] in [[Beaver Stadium]]. Miami followed up the victory with wins over [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]], and [[Troy State University|Troy State]]. After building up a 4–0 record, the Hurricanes defeated [[2001 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] in [[Doak Campbell Stadium]], 49–27, ending the Seminoles' 54-game home unbeaten streak. The Hurricanes then defeated [[2001 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]], 45–3, and [[Temple University|Temple]], 38–0, before heading to [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]] to take on [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]]. In the final minute of the fourth quarter, with Miami clinging to a 12–7 lead, Boston College quarterback [[Brian St. Pierre]] led the Eagles from their own 30-yard line all the way down to the Hurricanes' 9. With BC on the verge of a momentous upset, St. Pierre attempted a pass to receiver Ryan Read at the Miami 2-yard line. However, the ball deflected off the leg of Miami cornerback [[Mike Rumph]], landing in the hands of defensive end Matt Walters. Walters ran ten yards with the ball before teammate [[Ed Reed]] grabbed the ball out of his hands at around the Miami 20-yard line and raced the remaining 80-yards for a touchdown, resulting in an 18–7 Miami victory.

After surviving the scare from Boston College, Miami shutout #14 [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]], 59–0, and defeated #12 [[2001 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]], 65–7 in the Orange Bowl. The combined 124–7 score set what the ''Orlando Sentinel'' described as an NCAA-record for the largest margin of victory over consecutive ranked opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&amp;id=3406050|title=2001 Hurricanes cream of BCS champions crop|last=Schlabach|first=Mark|date=2008-05-21|work=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college_uf/2009/07/team-of-the-decade-the-2001-miami-hurricanes.html|title=Team of the decade: The 2001 Miami Hurricanes|last=Adelson|first=Andrea|date=2009-07-02|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final hurdle to the [[2002 Rose Bowl]] [[BCS National Championship Game]] was at [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]]. Miami jumped on Virginia Tech early, leading 20–3 at halftime, and 26–10 in the fourth quarter. But despite being outgained by the Hurricanes by 134 yards and being dominated in time-of-possession, the Hokies never quit. Virginia Tech added a couple of late touchdowns, attempting two-point conversions on each. The first conversion was successful, pulling them to 26–18, but receiver Ernest Wilford dropped a pass from quarterback Grant Noel in the endzone for the second conversion. Still, the resilient Hokies had one more chance to win the game late, taking possession of the ball at midfield and needing only a field goal to take the lead. But a diving, game-saving interception by Ed Reed sealed the Miami victory, 26–24. Defeating Virginia Tech earned the top-ranked Hurricanes an invitation to the Rose Bowl to take on BCS #2 [[2001 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] for the national championship.

In the Rose Bowl, the Hurricanes took a 34–0 halftime lead and cruised to a 37–14 win over the Huskers to capture their fifth national championship and put the finishing touches on a perfect 12–0 season. The Miami defense shut down [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]] winner [[Eric Crouch]] and the vaunted Huskers offense, holding Nebraska 200 yards below its season average. [[Ken Dorsey]] and [[Andre Johnson]] were named [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] co-Most Valuable Players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2007-07-24 | url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/043002aaf.html | title=Character, Class And Poise = Championship | author= | date=2007-07-24 | publisher=Hurricanesports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six Hurricane players earned All-American status and six players were finalists for national awards, including [[Maxwell Award]] winner, [[Ken Dorsey]], and [[Outland Trophy]] winner, [[Bryant McKinnie]]. Dorsey was also a [[Heisman Trophy]] finalist, finishing third.

The [[2001 Miami Hurricanes football team|2001 Miami Hurricanes]] are considered by some experts and historians as one of the greatest teams in college football history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-07-24 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=uschistory01miami |title=USC's Place In History: 2001 Miami |author= |date=2007-07-24 |publisher=ESPN.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626031205/http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=uschistory01miami |archivedate=June 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miami started the 2002 season as the defending national champion and the #1 ranked team in the country. Behind a high-powered offense led by senior quarterback [[Ken Dorsey]], new starting running back [[Willis McGahee]], and a stout defense anchored by [[Jonathan Vilma]], the Hurricanes completed their regular season schedule undefeated. The season was highlighted by a 41–16 win over rival [[2002 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] at [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]], the first regular season meeting between the rivals since 1987.

The Hurricanes' toughest test was an October clash against rival [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. Miami overcame a 13-point second half deficit to defeat the Seminoles, 28–27. The game was clinched when [[2002 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] kicker [[Xavier Beitia]] missed a 43-yard field goal, wide left, as time expired. Another signature win came four weeks later when Miami dominated the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee Volunteers]], 26–3, before a crowd of 107,745 at [[Neyland Stadium]], considered one of the most hostile road venues in college football.

Miami would finish 12–0 and clinch a berth in the [[2003 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] BCS National Championship Game after a wild 56–45 victory over Virginia Tech in which McGahee rushed for 205 yards and a school-record six touchdowns. Both Dorsey and McGahee were named as finalists for the Heisman Trophy, finishing 4th and 5th, respectively.

Miami, in the midst of a 34-game winning streak, was installed as a 13-point favorite in the Fiesta Bowl match up against #2 [[2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]]. The Hurricanes took an early 7–0 lead on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Dorsey to [[Roscoe Parrish]], but Ohio State seized control in the second quarter behind an aggressive pass rush, bolstered by constant [[blitz (American football)|blitzing]], and a stifling rush defense. The Buckeyes held a 14–7 lead at the half, and a field goal by [[Mike Nugent]] extended Ohio State's advantage to 17–7 midway through the third quarter.

A touchdown run by McGahee brought the Hurricanes within 3 points, but he suffered a knee injury early in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/2009/01/19/2009-01-19_ravens_willis_mcgahee_hospitalized_after.html|title=Ravens' Willis McGahee hospitalized after scary hit in AFC title game|date=2009-01-19|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miami was able to fight back and force overtime on a 40-yard field goal by Todd Sievers on the final play of the fourth quarter, aided by several questionable calls. Miami scored a touchdown on its first possession in overtime on a 7-yard pass from Dorsey to [[Kellen Winslow II]], and, on Ohio State's ensuing possession, the Hurricanes appeared to have won the game, 24–17, after Buckeyes quarterback [[Craig Krenzel]]'s fourth-and-3 pass from the Miami 5 fell incomplete in the end zone. Miami players and coaches rushed the field and stadium fireworks were set off to commemorate the program's apparent sixth national championship.

The celebration proved premature. At the conclusion of the play, Big 12 official Terry Porter threw a flag and made a controversial, [[pass interference]] call against Miami cornerback [[Glenn Sharpe]]. The penalty took the air out of Miami's sails and gave Ohio State new life, first-and-goal at the 1. The Buckeyes scored a touchdown to tie it at 24–24 at the end of the first overtime, and [[Maurice Clarett]]'s 5-yard touchdown run in the second overtime gave Ohio State a 31–24 lead.

Miami's ensuing possession saw Dorsey briefly knocked out of the game after a hit from linebacker [[Matt Wilhelm]]. After backup quarterback Derrick Crudup completed an 8-yard pass on third down, Dorsey re-entered and converted the crucial fourth-and-3 with a 7-yard completion to Winslow. Miami then drove to the Ohio State 2 yard-line, but was held to one yard on its next three plays, giving Ohio State the national championship.

Miami suffered through some offensive struggles in 2003 behind new quarterback [[Brock Berlin]]. A blowout loss at Virginia Tech in early November ended Miami's 39-game regular season winning streak and a loss the following week to [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] ended Miami's national championship aspirations. The Hurricanes rebounded to win the Big East Conference championship and finish the season 11–2 with an [[2004 Orange Bowl]] victory over [[2003 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]].

Miami joined the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] in 2004 and despite 3 conference losses, the Hurricanes ended the season with a [[Peach Bowl]] victory over rival [[2004 Florida Gators football team|Florida]].

The [[2005 Miami Hurricanes football team|2005]] season marked the debut of [[Kyle Wright]] as Miami's starting quarterback, although the much-ballyhooed Wright would struggle with consistency during the season with much of Miami's success that year fueled by its defense. After a loss to Florida State after placekick holder Bryan Monroe bobbled the snap for what would have been a game-tying field goal attempt, Miami would win eight straight games, including a road win over 3rd-ranked Virginia Tech, only to stumble two weeks later against underdog Georgia Tech. Miami's second conference loss of the season cost it a place in the inaugural ACC Championship game and it competed instead in the [[2005 Chick-fil-A Bowl|Peach Bowl]], where it lost to [[2005 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], 40–3.

2005 also saw the program embroiled in more controversy when it was reported several Miami football players had recorded a rap song in 2004 that contained lewd sexual references.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|9ujKxpAvLKg|Retrieved 2009-10-16.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song, recorded by an informal group that called itself &quot;7th Floor Crew&quot; and set to the beat of [[Aaliyah]]'s &quot;[[If Your Girl Only Knew]]&quot;, received much criticism in outlets such as [[ESPN]] and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref name=floorcrew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=2226626/|author=[[Pat Forde]]|work=ESPN.com|title=Rap recording could threaten Miami's progress|accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the negative publicity, the University issued a statement condemning its lyrical content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=jones/051118/crew|title=Nothing Shocking About 'Crew' |date=2005-11-18|accessdate = 2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 season included an [[Miami-FIU brawl|on-field brawl]] against [[FIU Golden Panthers football|Florida International]], the shooting death of Miami defensive tackle [[Bryan Pata]], and a four-game late-season losing streak. Only a [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] night victory over [[2006 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College]], in Miami's last game of the regular season, saved the Hurricanes from a losing regular season record.

The day following the Boston College victory, university president [[Donna Shalala]] terminated Coker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/sports/ncaafootball/24cnd-coker.html?scp=8&amp;sq=%22University%20of%20Miami%22&amp;st=cse|title=University of Miami Fires Coach Larry Coker|first=Charlie|last=Nobles|work=New York Times|date=November 24, 2006|accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coker coached through the postseason, where he won his final game, a 21–20 victory over [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada]] on December 31, 2006 in the [[2006 MPC Computers Bowl|MPC Computers Bowl]].

After a search that lasted two weeks, [[defensive coordinator]] and Miami alumnus [[Randy Shannon]] was officially introduced as the program's new head coach on December 8, 2006. Shannon reportedly agreed to a four-year deal worth over $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2690489|title=Defensive coordinator Shannon new Miami Coach
|agency=The Associated Press|author=Mark Schlabach &amp; Joe Schad|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=2006-12-07|accessdate=2006-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2010, Shannon's .553 career winning record is the worst of any University of Miami coach in four decades.

Shannon's first year as UM head coach in 2007 was one of the worst in the Hurricanes' modern history, with the team registering a losing 5–7 record. Under Shannon, the team failed to reach a bowl game for the first time in a decade, and it was the first non-penalized full-scholarship team to miss a bowl game in more than 25 years.

Media draft experts{{By whom|date=November 2009}} considered the freshmen on the 2008 team to be one of the top recruiting classes in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008teamrankings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rivals100.rivals.com/TeamRank.asp?postype=0&amp;sort=0&amp;year=2008|title= 2008 Team Rankings|date=2008-03-19|work=[[Rivals.com]]|accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 regular season was highlighted by losses to rivals [[2008 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] and [[2008 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]], as well as an upset victory over [[2008 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]]. The 26–3 loss to Florida was Miami's first in that series since 1985, snapping a 6-game winning streak against the Gators. Afterwards, the tension between the two teams was heightened when Shannon accused Florida coach [[Urban Meyer]] of trying to run up the score with an unsuccessful deep pass into the end zone in the game's final minute. The visiting Hurricanes were 22½ point underdogs in the nationally televised game but only trailed 9–3 heading into the fourth quarter, leading some to wonder whether Meyer was trying to compensate for his team's unimpressive performance.before kicking a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] with :25 remaining.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;runupscore&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/content/sports/epaper/2008/09/10/0910stoda.html|title=UM's Randy Shannon shouldn't complain about Gators running up score |last=Stoda|first=George|date=2008-09-10|work=[[Palm Beach Post]]|accessdate=2009-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;runupscore&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/college/article807133.ece?comments=legacy|title=Sapp rips Florida for late field goal|date=2008-09-12|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miami was knocked out of [[2008 ACC Championship Game|ACC Championship]] contention with a late-season loss to [[2008 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]] in which the Hurricanes surrendered the second-most rushing yards in school history (472).&lt;ref name=&quot;georgiatech08&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=283250059 |title=Georgia Tech racks up 473 rushing yards, dampers No. 23 Miami's ACC title hopes|date=November 20, 2008|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hurricanes finished the 2008 season at 7–6 after a 24–17 loss to [[2008 California Golden Bears football team|California]] in the [[2008 Emerald Bowl|Emerald Bowl]].

After the 2008 season, Shannon fired offensive coordinator [[Patrick Nix]], citing philosophical differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/colleges/um/story/830541.html (dead link)]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, starting quarterback [[Robert Marve]] left the team because he claimed not to be able to play for Coach Shannon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/sports/article953694.ece Robert Marve leaving Miami; 'Canes set tight transfer restrictions]&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon placed strict restrictions on Marve's potential transfer destinations and received much criticism in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/dec/31/sp-marve-saga-comes-to-end/sports-prepsports/|author=Joey Johnston|title=Drama-Filled Marve Saga at UM Comes to End'|publisher=[[Tampa Tribune]]|accessdate=Dec 31, 2008|date=Dec 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wetzel |first=Dan |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/news?slug=dw-marve010308&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Block on Marve transfer out of bounds – College Football – Rivals.com |publisher=Rivals.yahoo.com |date=2009-01-02 |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wojciechowski |first=Gene|title=Hurricanes send warning signals|publisher=ESPN|date=2009-01-07|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&amp;id=3815468&amp;sportCat=ncf |accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the University of Miami claimed in a press release that the restrictions were set because of suspected tampering by Marve's family or others on behalf of the Marve family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/colleges/um/story/835745.html (dead link)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon's staff suffered more upheaval when defensive coordinator Bill Young left to assume the same position at [[Oklahoma State University|Oklahoma State]], his alma mater, in late January 2009. North Carolina assistant John Lovett was hired to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canes choose Lovett as D.C. |publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated.

Shannon hired former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] offensive assistant [[Mark Whipple]] as Miami's new offensive coordinator and assistant head coach. Several Miami offensive players from the 2008 season returned, including quarterback [[Jacory Harris]], both starting running backs, most of the offensive line and its top six receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whipple to run Miami's offense |publisher=ESPN.

In fact, 21 [[true freshmen]] played during the 2008 season opener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Canes Eyeing Return to Glory|first=Amy|last=Shipley|work=Washington Post|page=D1|date=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 season began on a poor note after two back up quarterbacks, Taylor Cook and Cannon Smith both transferred out during fall practice, leaving the young Hurricane team with only one serviceable backup in true freshman A.J. Highsmith. Sophomore [[Jacory Harris]] directed the newly implemented offense. To make matters worse, starting defensive end Adewale Ojomo suffered a broken jaw in a locker room fight that led to a season-ending injury, causing the already young Hurricane team to go into their season short handed.

Miami faced adifficult schedule to start the 2009 season with visits to #18 [[Florida State]], a home game against #15 [[Georgia Tech]], a visit to [[Lane Stadium]] and the #7 Virginia Tech Hokies and a home visit from the defending [[Big 12 Conference]] champions and BCS Champion runner-ups in #3 [[University of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/teams/schedule?teamId=2390 |title=Miami (FL) 2012 Schedule - Hurricanes Home and Away - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some national media outlets and sites such as [[ESPN]] predicted at best a 2–2 record for the Hurricanes with some even predicting an 0–4 start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/preview09/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&amp;id=4436645 |title=Who has the toughest road in 2009? - College Football - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miami opened up their 2009 season against their rival the Florida State Seminoles on Labor Day night for a national broadcast for ESPN. Billed as a &quot;Battle of Rebuilding Programs&quot;, Quarterback Jacory Harris led a heroic comeback in Tallahassee to beat the then ranked Seminoles 38–34, overcoming a late interception and apparent injury to Harris in the 4th quarter. The next week, Miami welcomed the [[triple option]] offense of the #14 [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] in yet another ESPN prime-time game. Georgia Tech came in hot off of a big ACC win against [[Clemson University]] the previous week and held a 4–0 record against the Hurricanes in the last 4 years, including the previous years pounding in Atlanta (referenced above). The 2009 contest would be a different story all together, as the Hurricanes handily beat the Jackets 33–17 at home and allowed only 95 rushing yards in the process. The next week, with the Hurricanes in the national spotlight for the first time in 5 years, the #9 Miami team visited the  #11 [[Virginia Tech Hokies]]. In pouring rain, Tech defeated the Hurricanes by a final score of 31–7. Beat up and embarrassed, Miami then played the [[Oklahoma Sooners]]. Without [[Heisman Award]] winner [[Sam Bradford]], Oklahoma took an early 10–0 lead after two early Jacory Harris interceptions. Going into halftime, the Hurricanes trailed the Sooners 10–7 in a highly contested football game. Miami came out for the second with a huge hit on the kick off team by [[Cory Nelms]] that forced the Sooners to start inside their own 20. The following play, Sophomore Corner [[Brandon Harris]] hit Oklahoma Quarterback [[Landry Jones]] and forced a fumble that eventually led to a Hurricane touchdown. The momentum stayed with the Hurricanes as they rode to a 21–20 win over the #8 team in the land. Following the opening four weeks, Miami was 3–1 and was the talk of sports stations nationwide.

Following the gauntlet first third of the season, the Hurricanes won against [[Florida A&amp;M]] at home and on the road against [[University of Central Florida|UCF]], moving all the way up to #10 in the polls. The Canes then had to take on the always tough Clemson Tigers in Miami in what was a contest of speed and athleticism. Turnovers, missed opportunities and stand-out back [[CJ Spiller]] led the Tigers to a 40–37 overtime win against the Hurricanes, knocking them out of BCS contention and putting the [[ACC Championship Game]] in serious jeopardy. A win against [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]] on Halloween kept the Hurricanes in the conference race, which they followed up on with a 52–17 defeat of the [[University of Virginia]] in Miami. The next week [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] topped Miami 33–24 with an unimpressive performance by Jacory Harris and the offense. Miami finished up the 2009 regular season with back-to-back wins over [[Duke]] and in-state rival [[University of South Florida|USF]]. Miami's final record was 9–3, finishing in 3rd place for the [[ACC Coastal Division]] behind Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech.

The announcement of the 2009 bowl selections stirred some controversy. Instead of choosing the 3rd best team in the ACC (Miami), the [[Gator Bowl]] chose the Florida State Seminoles to represent the ACC against the [[West Virginia University]] instead of the Hurricanes because of the retirement of legendary FSU coach [[Bobby Bowden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smits |first=Garry |url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/college/florida_state_seminoles/2009-11-30/story/bobby_bowdens_final_game_as_florida_state_co |title=Bobby Bowden's final game as Florida State coach likely in the Gator Bowl |publisher=jacksonville.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hurricanes were relegated to the [[Champs Sports Bowl]] in Orlando to play against the 9–3 [[Wisconsin Badgers]]. Though the Hurricanes were heavy favorites coming into the contest, the Badgers beat up on the Hurricanes consistently throughout the game. Though the Hurricanes started off fast with a big return to open the game by Sam Shields, the Canes just could not maintain any offense throughout the game and had no answer for the power offense of Wisconsin. Going into halftime, the Hurricanes trailed 17–7 and Graig Cooper blew out his knee on the poor turf just before halftime on a kick off return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs4.com/ncaa/graig.cooper.injury.2.1397602.html ] {{wayback|url=http://cbs4.com/ncaa/graig.cooper.injury.2.1397602.html |date=20100102130111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Miami scored a late touchdown and recovered the [[onside kick]], they fell to Wisconsin 20–14 and finished the season at 9–4.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;2010 Miami Hurricanes Football Media Guide&quot;, 2009 Champs Sports Bowl recap, pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hurricanes finished the 2010 regular season with a 7–5 record which included losses to rivals Florida State and Virginia Tech as well as the first ever loss to in-state opponent USF in the last game of the season.

Following Shannon's release, Miami hired [[Temple University]] head coach [[Al Golden (American football)|Al Golden]] as their new head coach, on December 13, 2010.

Golden posted a 6-6 record in his first year at Miami. It was only the third time, since 1979, that the program had failed to register a winning record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/hurricanes/al-goldens-contract-extension-gives-stability-to-um-1996353.html &quot;Al Golden's Contract Extension Gives Stability to UM,&quot; ''The Palm Beach Post'', November 26, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second season as head coach, the Hurricanes finished with a 7-5 mark. This resulted in a three way tie, with [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]] and [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]], for the best record in the ACC coastal division. [[2012 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|North Carolina]], which had defeated the Hurricanes earlier in the season, would have been declared the coastal division champion based on the ACC tie breaker formula. However, due to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sanctions, they were ineligible for postseason play. Miami finished in second place based on the formula. However, due to likely pending NCAA sanctions from the [[2011 University of Miami athletics scandal|Nevin Shapiro scandal]], the university's administration preemptively chose to forego post-season play for the second consecutive year. Had they played, it would have marked their only appearance in the ACC championship game, since joining the conference, in 2004. It would also have set up a rematch with [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]], who had defeated the Hurricanes earlier in the season.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In October 2013, after a two and a half year investigation, the NCAA announced that &quot;the committee acknowledged and accepted the extensive and significant self-imposed penalties by the university.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ncaa.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/latest+news/2013/october/university+of+miami+lacked+institutional+control+resulting+in+a+decade+of+violations ]{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, no further bowl ban would be enforced. As a result, Miami was eligible to compete in ACC championship and BCS bowls for the 2013–14 season. However, the NCAA stripped Miami of nine scholarships over three years.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

On October 25, 2015, following a 58-0 loss to [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]], the worst defeat in school history, the university's athletic director, Blake James, announced [[Al Golden (American football)|Golden]] had been terminated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/13972433/miami-hurricanes-fire-al-golden-head-coach Miami Hurricanes fire Al Golden as head coach day after 58-0 pounding] Matt Fortuna.

[[File:Sun Life Stadium.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Hard Rock Stadium]] (formerly Sun Life Stadium) before a Hurricanes game in 2009]]
{{Main article|Hard Rock Stadium|Miami Orange Bowl}}
Miami plays its home games at [[Hard Rock Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]], located approximately {{convert|21|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the university's main [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2007/08/27/orange-bowl-and-dolphin-stadium-side-by-side/|title=Orange Bowl and Dolphin Stadium Side-by-Side |date=2007-08-27|work=The Miami Hurricane|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium also serves as home to the [[Miami Dolphins]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] and was also home to [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Florida Marlins]] until 2011.
From 1937 through 2007, the team played its home games at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]], located in the [[Little Havana]] section of [[Miami]]. In the late 2000s, the City of Miami, the owner of the Orange Bowl, proposed to extensively renovate it. However, those plans fell by the wayside as the city focused on keeping the Marlins baseball team in town, forcing the university to threaten a move to Dolphin Stadium if a plan to renovate the stadium was not in place within 45 days. When the city could not deliver on a renovation plan, the University's Board of Trustees, on the recommendation of UM President [[Donna Shalala]], approved the shift to Dolphin Stadium on August 21, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate=2007-08-21 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2984425 | title=Miami leaving Orange Bowl, will play in Dolphin Stadium | agency=Associated Press | date=2007-08-21|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its inception, the program played at Tamiami Park and, later, Moore Park before moving to the then [[Miami Orange Bowl|Burdine Stadium]] in 1937.

The team practices on-campus at the Greentree Practice Fields, which were named the College Football Field of the Year by the SportsTurf Managers Association in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/012207aad.html|title=Greentree Practice Fields Selected Best in College Football|date=2007-01-22 |work=HurricaneSports.com |accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hecht Athletic Center, also located on-campus, serves as the program's training facility and is home to the football offices. In November 2010 the university announced a gift of five million dollars from the Ted and Todd Schwartz family foundation that would be used to build the Schwartz Center for Athletic Excellence. The facility will cater to over 400 student athletes on the campus with a sports medicine facility, training room, and academic center. The facility will also have features specifically designed for the football team. A locker room and players lounge for football players will be a part of the facility, as will a gallery of champions and a dedicated area to the football team's ring of honor. The building is an expansion of the current Hecht Athletic Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurricanesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=28700&amp;ATCLID=205545783 |title=$5M LEAD GIFT TO ESTABLISH SCHWARTZ CENTER FOR ATHLETIC EXCELLENCE - University of Miami Hurricanes Official Athletic Site |publisher=Hurricanesports.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2006 NFL season|2006]]  [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Champion [[Chicago Bears]] used the football team's training facilities while preparing for [[Super Bowl XLI]]. The other team, [[American Football Conference|AFC]] Champion [[Indianapolis Colts]], used the [[Miami Dolphins Training Facility]] at [[Nova Southeastern University]] in Davie, Florida.

===Winning streaks===
Miami also has two of the [[Longest NCAA Division I football winning streaks|longest winning streaks in NCAA Division I history]]. From 2000 to 2003, Miami won 34 consecutive games, tying for sixth all-time. The streak started on September 23, 2000 with a 47–10 victory at [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] and ended on January 3, 2003 with a 31–24 double overtime loss to [[2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] in the [[2003 Fiesta Bowl]]. Miami also won 29 straight games from October 27, 1990 to January 1, 1993, good for thirteenth on the all-time list. That streak was snapped when the top-ranked Hurricanes were upset by second-ranked [[1993 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], 34–13 in the [[1993 Sugar Bowl]].

Miami owns the record for the longest home winning streak in NCAA history, winning 58 straight games at the Orange Bowl. The record streak began with a 38–0 shutout victory over Cincinnati on October 12, 1985 and ended with a 38–20 loss to Washington on September 24, 1994. The 58 game streak includes three Orange Bowl victories where Miami was the away team because of the Orange Bowl's tie to the Big 8 conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NCAA Football Records (see page 213) |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/DI/2009/2009Collegiate.pdf|work=NCAA Football records (see page 213)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its own lengthy winning streaks, Miami has snapped four streaks of 20 games or more in its history.

The Hurricanes halted top-ranked [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]'s 20-game streak and won their second national championship when they defeated the Sooners, 20–14, in the [[1988 Orange Bowl]]. The Hurricanes ended top-ranked [[1989 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]]'s 23-game winning streak with a 27–10 win on November 25, 1989. Miami also ended the 20-game winning streak of [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] when Miami defeated the third-ranked Bruins 49–45 on December 5, 1998.

==Rivalries==
{{See also|Florida Cup}}
Miami's traditional rivals are [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]]&lt;ref name=&quot;1997 fsu1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1997 fsu2&quot;/&gt; and [[Florida Gators football|Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;florida rivalry1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;florida rivalry2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/columns/harig_bob/1427556.html|title=UM-UF rivalry was once biggest in the state|last=Harig|first=Bob|date=2002-09-05|work=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2002, the [[Florida Cup]] has been awarded to the team that finishes with the best head-to-head record in years where Miami, Florida, and Florida State all face each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/6774589/CE/3032112/|title=Miami settles for 'state title' with Peach win|last=Associated Press|date=2005-01-02 |work=NBCSports.com|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five Florida Cups have been awarded, with Miami wining the first three.

Miami also had heated rivalry with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] through 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;nd rivalry1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nd rivalry2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/30355617|title=Notre Dame–Miami rivalry to be renewed?|date=2009-04-22|work=NBCSports.com|accessdate=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miami also has a rivalry with [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]].  See ''[[Nebraska-Miami football rivalry]]''

===Florida State===
{{See also|Florida State–Miami football rivalry|Wide Right I|Wide Right II}}
The rivalry dates to 1951, when the Hurricanes defeated the Seminoles 35–13 in their inaugural meeting. The schools have played every year since 1966, with Miami holding the all-time advantage, 31–29. Upon the conclusion of their 2003 regular-season schedules, the teams represented their respective conferences in the 2004 [[FedEx Orange Bowl]] (Miami being the champions of the Big East, and Florida State being the champions of the ACC). Miami won the bowl game 16–14; it was the only time the schools have met in post-season football play. The 60 meetings between the teams of FSU and Miami eclipsed the rivalry between the Hurricanes and the Gators (from the [[University of Florida]]) following their 2010 game; the series of games between UM and Florida is Miami's second-longest at 55 games.

During the 1980s and '90s, the series emerged as one of the premier rivalries in college football.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Between 1983 and 2002, the Hurricanes and Seminoles combined to win 7 national championships and play in 14 bowl games with a national championship at stake. The 1988 game starred 57 future [[National Football League|NFL]] pros on the combined rosters. Since 2004, the year Miami left the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] to join the expanded 12-member [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], the universities have been conference foes, though they are placed in separate divisions within the conference. This alignment creates the potential for the two teams to meet for a second time in the [[ACC Championship Game]], should each win their respective divisions in any particular season. Such a rematch has yet to happen after 9 years of ACC Championship Games, as of 2013.

The series has consistently drawn very high [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] with the 2006 Miami–Florida State game being the most-watched college football game—regular-season or postseason—in [[ESPN]] history, and the 2009 and 1994 meetings being the second- and fifth-most watched regular season games, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratings&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking-news/story/1226762.html|title=ESPN viewers flocked to Miami Hurricanes–FSU matchup|last=Miller Degnan|first=Susan|date=2009-09-10|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2009-09-12}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
{{Main article|Florida–Miami football rivalry}}
Miami's rivalry with [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] dates back to 1938, making it the oldest rivalry among Florida's &quot;Big Three&quot; of Miami, Florida, and Florida State.&lt;ref name=&quot;florida rivalry2&quot;/&gt;  The Hurricanes defeated the Gators, 19–7, in the first meeting between the geographic rivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;florida rivalry2&quot;/&gt; The Seminole War Canoe was carved in 1955 out of a cypress struck by lightning and was given to the winner of the annual football game. The canoe is meant to symbolize the fighting spirit of the Seminole people that is often on display during games between the Hurricanes and Gators. The canoe is now on permanent display at the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame on the Coral Gables campus.

Miami holds the edge in the all-time series with a 29–26 record against Florida. The two schools met every year from 1944 until 1987, but have not played regularly since then. Florida canceled the annual series after the 1987 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;florida rivalry1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;florida rivalry2&quot;/&gt; when the requirement of the [[Southeastern Conference]] for member schools to play eight conference games induced the University of Florida to fill out the non-conference portion of its schedule with teams that do not require a home-and-home arrangement,&lt;ref name=&quot;florida rivalry2&quot;/&gt; except for Florida State.

From 1986 to 2003, Miami won all six of the games between the schools, including victories in the 2001 [[Sugar Bowl]] and the 2004 [[Peach Bowl]]. Florida snapped its 23-year drought against Miami with a 26–3 win over the Hurricanes in 2008. The last game between the two was September 7, 2013 at [[Sun Life Stadium]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Future&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalchamps.net/NCAA/future_schedules/miamiFL_future.htm |title=Miami Hurricanes Football Future Schedules |publisher=NationalChamps.net |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miami won 21-16. The two teams are slated to meet again during the opening weekend of the 2019 college football season at the Camping World Kickoff in Orlando, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbschedules.com/2016/04/florida-miami-fl-finalize-deal-open-2019-season-orlando|title=Florida, Miami (FL) finalize deal to open 2019 season in Orlando|accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notre Dame===
{{Main article|Catholics vs. Convicts}}
While not the most regular rivalry for either school, Notre Dame's games with Miami, dubbed by Irish fans in the late 1980s as &quot;Catholics vs. Convicts&quot; still stand out as one of the most heated feuds in college football history, which included a 58-7 blow out by the Hurricanes in 1985 and a failed Jimmy Johnson two-point conversion attempt to go for the win instead of tying the game in 1988. After not meeting for two decades, the schools faced each other in the 2010 Sun Bowl, with Notre Dame prevailing 33–17. The Fighting Irish hold a 17–7–1 edge.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 ND Guide History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://und.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/nd/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/07fbguidehistory  |title = 2007 Notre Dame Media Guide: History and Records (pages 131–175) | publisher= und.cstv.com | accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miami and Notre Dame renewed their regular season rivalry at [[Soldier Field]] on Saturday, October 6, 2012, with Notre Dame winning 41-3. They will begin a new series of games in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/12/05/its-back-on-catholics-vs-reformed-convicts-in-sun-bowl/related/ &quot;It's back on: Catholics vs. (Reformed) Catholics,&quot; December 5, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==

===Touchdown Tommy===
Touchdown Tommy is the cannon that is fired off when the team runs out of the tunnel, after every point that the Hurricanes score, and the conclusion of a victory. The cannon is kept by the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity's Cannon Master and fired off during the games by the senior brothers of Sigma Chi. Touchdown Tommy is the third oldest tradition at the University of Miami, after the [[Iron Arrow Honor Society]] and [[Sebastian the Ibis]].

===The Smoke===
One of the Hurricanes' best-known traditions is the team's entrance scene. The team enters the field through a large cloud of white smoke billowing from its entrance tunnel, amid a tape of a hurricane blasting over the sound system. The smoke comes from fire extinguisher exhaust that billows from a series of pipes welded together by school transportation director Bob Nalette in the 1950s. The pipes were moved to Sun Life Stadium when the Hurricanes moved there in 2008.

Following Miami's rise to prominence in the 1980s, many high school, college and [[National Football League|NFL]] teams over the last 25 years have copied this practice, and in 2001 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] made a parody of it for a Saturday college football commercial.

===Ring of Honor===
In 1997, the university established the 'Ring of Honor' as a way to honor outstanding players who have passed through the Hurricane football program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/011400aac.html|title=The Ring Of Honor|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members are selected by an anonymous advisory committee, the director of athletics and the head football coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/092508aad.html Retrieved 2009-12-12]&lt;/ref&gt; The names and jersey numbers of the inductees were displayed on the upper deck of the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] (which has since been torn down). The inaugural class of included [[Jim Dooley]], [[Ted Hendricks]], [[George Mira]], and [[Vinny Testaverde]]. These four players are the only ones in the history of the program to have their numbers retired by the university as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurricanesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=28700&amp;ATCLID=205549261 &quot;Hurricanes Football: Retired Numbers&quot; at Hurricanesports.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Vinny Testaverde's number was taken out of retirement for the 2015–2016 football season, at Testaverde's behest. His son currently wears #14.

A second group of players consisting of [[Ottis Anderson]], [[Don Bosseler]], [[Bernie Kosar]], and Burgess Owens was inducted in 1999. After a nine-year hiatus, five new players were added in 2008: [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs [[Jim Kelly]] and [[Jim Otto]], former [[Heisman Trophy]]-winner [[Gino Torretta]], running back [[Edgerrin James]], and defensive lineman [[Cortez Kennedy]].

In 2009, [[College Football Hall of Fame]] defensive back [[Bennie Blades]], running back and former Miami head coach [[Eddie Dunn]], and quarterback [[Steve Walsh (American football)|Steve Walsh]] were inducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/roh09.html|title=Ring of Honor – Class of 2009|work=Hurricanesports.com|accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miami Hurricanes in the NFL===
{{Main article|List of Miami Hurricanes in the NFL}}

Many Miami players go on to play in the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;draft record&quot;/&gt; The school holds multiple NFL draft related records: most first-round draft picks in a two-year period (11, 2003–2004); most first-round draft picks in a three-year period (15, 2002–2004); and most first-round picks in a four-year period (19, 2001–2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Miami's NFL Draft History (07/24/07) | accessdate=2006-11-11 | url=http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/schools/miami | format=PDF | publisher=Hurricanesports.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060910055021/http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/schools/miami |archivedate = September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 through 2008, Miami set an [[NFL Draft]] record by having at least one player selected in the first round of 14 consecutive drafts.&lt;ref name=&quot;draft record&quot;/&gt; The Hurricanes once had a streak of 149 consecutive regular season weeks where a former Hurricane scored a touchdown in an NFL game; the streak started in Week 15 of the 2002 NFL regular season and ended in Week 11 of the 2011 season. During the streak, 33 different former Hurricanes scored touchdowns and a total of 661 touchdowns were scored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://procanes.com/StatsRosters/stats/index.html |title=:: Stats |publisher=Procanes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setting a new record for most players from one school, eleven former Hurricanes were selected to the [[2010 Pro Bowl]], which happened to take place at Miami's [[Sun Life Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/hurricanes/university-of-miami-sets-a-record-with-11-202461.html |title=University of Miami sets a record with 11 on Pro Bowl roster |last=Frias |first=Carlos |date=January 30, 2010 |newspaper=[[Palm Beach Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the program's last six head coaches, three have gone directly on to head coaching positions in the [[National Football League|NFL]]:
*[[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] – [[Dallas Cowboys]] (NFL)
*[[Dennis Erickson]] – [[Seattle Seahawks]] (NFL)
*[[Butch Davis]] – [[Cleveland Browns]] (NFL)

Howard Schnellenberger resigned as the Hurricanes head coach in order to become part owner and coach of Miami's first [[USFL]] franchise to be named &quot;The Spirit of Miami.&quot; It did not materialize, and he took the head coaching position at the [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]]. (Schnellenberger would eventually end his coaching career at another South Florida school, [[Florida Atlantic Owls football|Florida Atlantic University]].)

==Controversies and scandals==
The [[University of Miami]] has also experienced some degree of controversies, scandals and incidents which at times have led to [[NCAA]] sanctions, suspensions, and negative publicity for the university.

===2006: FIU brawl===
{{Main article|FIU–Miami football brawl}}
On October 14, 2006, in the first meeting of cross-town programs, Miami and the [[FIU Panthers football|Florida International Golden Panthers]] brawled after a [[Extra point|PAT]].

FIU cornerback Chris Smith wrestled Miami holder Matt Perelli to the ground after the kick and appeared to punch him in the chin. Another FIU cornerback, Marshall McDuffie, Jr., kicked Perelli in the head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?p=1250765 Miami, FIU extend brawl punishments]&lt;/ref&gt; Miami's [[Anthony Reddick]] swung his helmet at FIU players and Miami's [[Brandon Meriweather]] kicked an FIU player. FIU's A'Mod Ned, who was injured, came onto the field and swung at Miami players with his crutches. The fight lasted just over one minute before the coaches of both teams were able to separate the players. Florida Highway Patrol state troopers and City of Miami police arrived on the field as the fight was going on and remained a visual presence on the sidelines and in the stands to prevent further fighting. The game was delayed approximately 15 to 20 minutes as the officials attempted to sort out which players were ejected and what, if any, penalty yards needed to be enforced.

The next day, 31 players from both schools were punished–18 from FIU, 13 from Miami; the Miami players were handed one-game suspensions, while the FIU players were suspended for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,220962,00.html|title=31 Players were suspended for their involvement|accessdate=2007-05-21 | work=Fox News | date=2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Miami players were suspended indefinitely and the rest were also assigned community service work.

===2002–2010: Shapiro scandal===
{{main article|2011 University of Miami athletics scandal}}
A [[Ponzi scheme]]r, convicted [[felony|felon]] and former Miami booster, [[Nevin Shapiro]], claimed he used investor funds to finance donations to the University of Miami's athletic program and gave an estimated $2 million in illegal benefits to at least 72 current or former football and basketball players and coaches from 2002–2010. A [[Yahoo! Sports]] report alleged that Shapiro, through his donations, violated at least four major NCAA bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Robinson, Charles |title=Renegade Miami football booster spells out illicit benefits to players |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/investigations/news;_ylt=Al4hB9JlfNUz78ftGnbBKHhRMuB_?slug=cr-renegade_miami_booster_details_illicit_benefits_081611 |work=Yahoo! Sports |date=August 16, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation of the allegations, the university self-imposed a ban on bowl participation. In October 2013, the NCAA announced that the university would lose three football scholarships in each of the next three seasons, but there would be no further bowl ban. The university became eligible again for bowl participation as of the 2013–14 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncaa.org&quot;/&gt;

==Documentary film==
{{Main article|The U (film)}}
In 2009, Miami-based media studio [[Rakontur]] released a documentary film called ''[[The U (documentary)|The U]]'', as part of [[ESPN]]'s 30 for 30 film series. The film depicts the rise of the University of Miami's football tradition throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://30for30.espn.com/film/the-u.html ''The U'', ESPN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rakontur.com/the-u/|title=(rak on tur') – The U|accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the filmmaker, the university chose not to be involved in the project, and denied access to coach Randy Shannon, Paul Dee and [[Edward T. Foote II|Tad Foote]], the former president of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/606/story/1348738.html|title=University of Miami resists ESPN film, but will show it|first=Barry|last=Jackson|date=Dec 1, 2009|accessdate=20091-12-04 |work=Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film features the rise of the UM football program in the 1980s, but also includes details related to player crime and drug usage and privileges provided to players, including [[Luther Campbell]]'s &quot;pay for play&quot;, in which the rap star reportedly paid UM players for major hits and plays. The film addresses the controversial and pioneering nature of the UM football program. The film was pre-screened on campus on December 10, 2009 with only two student athletes attending&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themiamihurricane.com/2009/12/11/the-u-documentary/|title=The U Documentary|work=Miami Hurricane|date=December 11, 2009 |first=Justin |last=Antweil|accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and televised two days later on [[ESPN]]. The film became the network's most watched documentary program. The U Part 2 was also created to depict the rise and once again fall of their football program.
