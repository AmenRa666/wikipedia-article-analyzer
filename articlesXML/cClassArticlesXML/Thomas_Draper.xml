'''Thomas Percy Draper''' [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[King's Counsel|KC]] (29 December 1864 – 11 July 1946) was an Australian lawyer, politician, and judge. He was a member of the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Western Australia]] from 1907 to 1911 and again from 1917 to 1921, and was [[Attorney-General of Western Australia|attorney-general]] in the first government of Sir [[James Mitchell (Australian politician)|James Mitchell]]. He later served on the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] from 1921 to 1939.

==Early life==
Draper was born in [[Warrington]], [[Lancashire]], England, to Annie (née Webster) and Thomas Draper, his father being a [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]]. He attended [[Tonbridge School]] before going on to [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where he graduated in 1886. Draper was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in England in 1891, as a member of the [[Inner Temple]], but left for Western Australia the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/library/MPHistoricalData.nsf/(Lookup)/278C9A59B4BF18B2482577E50028A5C7?OpenDocument Thomas Percy Draper] – Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 15 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught for a term at [[Hale School|The High School]] in [[Perth]], and then spent a period as an [[Associate lawyer|associate]] to [[Alfred Hensman]], a judge on the Supreme Court. Draper went into private practice in 1894, and eventually became a partner in the firm of [[Stephen Henry Parker]]. He was elected to the [[City of Perth|Perth City Council]] in 1899, defeating [[Frank Wilson (politician)|Frank Wilson]] (a future [[Premier of Western Australia|premier]]), but resigned his seat in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;&gt;{{cite AuDB |first=Geoffrey|last=Bolton|authorlink=Geoffrey Bolton|first2=Pat|last2=Simpson|title=Draper, Thomas Percy (1864–1946)|volume=8|edition=|year=1981|id2=draper-thomas-percy-6017|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary career==
Draper entered parliament at [[West Perth state by-election, 1907|the 1907 by-election]] for the [[Electoral district of West Perth|seat of West Perth]], which had been caused by the resignation of [[Frederick Illingworth]]. He was re-elected at the [[Western Australian state election, 1908|1908 state election]], but did not re-contest his seat at the [[Western Australian state election, 1911|1911 election]],&lt;ref name=&quot;res&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=David|authorlink=David Black (historian)|last2=Prescott|first2=Valerie|title=Election statistics : Legislative Assembly of Western Australia, 1890–1996|year=1997|publisher=Western Australian Parliamentary History Project and Western Australian Electoral Commission|location=Perth, [W.A.]|isbn=0730984095}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead choosing to focus on his legal practice. He had been made [[King's Counsel]] in 1910. During the war, Draper served as chairman of the state branch of the [[Australian Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; He returned to parliament at the [[Western Australian state election, 1917|1917 state election]], winning his old seat of West Perth as a [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]] candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;res&quot;/&gt; In the [[1918 New Year Honours]], Draper was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) for his wartime services. He was promoted to commander of the order (CBE) in October of the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt;

In May 1919, [[James Mitchell (Australian politician)|James Mitchell]] replaced [[Hal Colebatch]] as [[Premier of Western Australia|premier]], and promoted Draper to [[First Mitchell Ministry|his new ministry]] as [[Attorney-General of Western Australia|attorney-general]] (replacing [[Robert Thomson Robinson]]). During his term in office, he introduced legislation that liberalised Western Australia's divorce laws, and also amended the state's electoral act to allow women to stand for parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; At the [[Western Australian state election, 1921|1921 state election]], Draper was opposed in West Perth by two other Nationalist candidates – [[Eben Allen]], who had held the seat between 1911 and 1917, and [[Edith Cowan]], one of the first five female candidates for parliament in Western Australia. Allen was eliminated on [[first preferences]], and Cowan went on to win the seat with 50.8 percent of the [[two-candidate-preferred vote]] against Draper.&lt;ref name=&quot;res&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/37478931 &quot;WEST PERTH.&quot;], ''[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|The Western Mail]]'', 17 March 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; She became the first female parliamentarian in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AuDB |first=Margaret|last=Brown|title= Cowan, Edith Dircksey (1861–1932) |volume=8|edition=|year=1981|id2=cowan-edith-dircksey-5791|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Draper became the first sitting attorney-general to lose his seat at a general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/ParliamentaryHandbook/23rd%20Edition%20of%20the%20Parliament%20Handbook%20-%20Final%20Version.pdf ''The Western Australian Parliamentary Handbook (Twenty-Third Edition)''] (2014), Parliament of Western Australia, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|[[Frederick Moorhead]], attorney-general in the short-lived government of [[Alf Morgans]], was defeated in his seat while in the ministry, but this occurred at a [[ministerial by-election]] rather than a general election.}}

==Judicial career and later life==
In April 1921, just over a month after losing his seat in parliament, Draper was nominated to the Supreme Court as a [[puisne justice]]. He replaced [[John Rooth]], who had retired due to ill health, and joined Sir [[Robert McMillan (Australian judge)|Robert McMillan]] (the [[Chief Justice of Western Australia|chief justice]]), [[Robert Bruce Burnside|Robert Burnside]], and [[John Northmore (judge)|John Northmore]] on the bench. During his time on the court, Draper dealt mainly with [[arbitration]] cases, although he did preside over some criminal trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb&quot;/&gt; He announced his intention to retire early from the court in December 1938, although his actual retirement did not take effect until July 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/46286681 &quot;MR. JUSTICE DRAPER.&quot;], ''[[The West Australian]]'', 22 December 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; The premier at the time, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]'s [[John Willcock]], announced that he would not immediately fill the vacancy left by Draper, due to a perceived lack of need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/46419000 &quot;ARBITRATION BENCH.&quot;], ''The West Australian'', 23 August 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; The vacancy was in fact not filled until 1949, when [[Lawrence Jackson (Australian judge)|Lawrence Jackson]] was appointed as the new fourth justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.wa.gov.au/F/former_judges_and_masters_print.aspx Former Judges and Masters] – Supreme Court of Western Australia. Retrieved 27 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Draper died in Perth in July 1946, aged 81.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; Outside of politics and the judiciary, he had a keen interest in [[cricket]], serving as president of the [[Western Australian Cricket Association]] (WACA) from 1924 to 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/46395876 &quot;NEW W.A.C.A. PRESIDENT.&quot;], ''The West Australian'', 1 June 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; He was married twice, firstly to Mabel Constance Parker in 1894, with whom he had four sons and two daughters. He was widowed in 1930, and remarried the following year to Bessie Melrose Barker (née Ferguson), but was widowed a second time in 1944. Draper was related by marriage to two other prominent legal identities in Western Australia – his first wife was the daughter of Sir [[Stephen Henry Parker]], who was chief justice between 1906 and 1913, while her sister, Rose Elizabeth Parker, married Sir [[Norbert Keenan]], who was attorney-general between 1906 and 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;
