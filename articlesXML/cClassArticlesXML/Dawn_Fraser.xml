'''Dawn Fraser''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|AO,|MBE}} (born 4 September 1937) is an Australian freestyle champion [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] and former politician.  She is one of only three swimmers to have won the same Olympic event three times – in her case the women's 100-metre freestyle.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/fr/dawn-fraser-1.html Dawn Fraser]. sports-reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Australia, she is often known for her controversial behaviour and [[larrikinism|larrikin]] character as much as for her athletic ability.

==Early life==
Fraser was born in the Sydney suburb of [[Balmain, New South Wales]] in 1937 into a poor working-class family, the youngest of eight children.&lt;ref name=&quot;icons&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Icons of Women's Sport |last1=Boyer Sagert |first1=Kelley |last2=Overman |first2=Steven J. |pages=137–152 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-313-38549-0 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=b_kTU8LfcqAC&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;ots=PSRWjXU4sq&amp;dq=%22Dawn%20Fraser%22%20father%20%20Balmain%201937&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dawn%20Fraser%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Kenneth Fraser, was from [[Embo]], Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;northern_times&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northern-times.co.uk/News/Olympic-swim-star-makes-surprise-visit-30082012.htm |title=Olympic swim star makes surprise visit |last=McMorran |first=Caroline |publisher=The Northern Times |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was spotted at the early age of 14 by Sydney coach Harry Gallagher swimming at the local sea baths.

==Swimming career==
Fraser won eight Olympic medals, including four gold medals, and six [[Commonwealth Games]] gold medals. She also held 39 records. The 100 metres freestyle record was hers for 15 years from 1 December 1956 to 8 January 1972.

She is the first of only three swimmers in Olympic history ([[Krisztina Egerszegi]] of Hungary and [[Michael Phelps]] of the United States being the two others) to have won individual gold medals for the same event at three successive Olympics [[List of Olympic medalists in swimming (women)|(100 metres freestyle – 1956, 1960, 1964)]].

In October 1962, she became the first woman to swim 100 metres freestyle in less than one minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Clarkson|title=Champion's world time in 110 yds|publisher=The Sun-Herald|page=67|date=28 October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1973, eight years after Fraser retired, that her 100m record of 58.9 secs was broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swim contest a spectacular of records|publisher=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]], [[Reuters]]|work=The Sun-Herald|page=107|date=2 May 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo, Fraser angered swimming team sponsors and the Australian Swimming Union (ASU) by marching in the opening ceremony against their wishes, and wearing an older swimming costume in competition because it was more comfortable than the one supplied by the sponsors. She was accused of stealing an Olympic flag from a flagpole outside [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]]'s palace from the [[Kōkyo]]. She was arrested but released without charge. In the end she was given the flag as a souvenir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dawn Fraser: still kicking:|url = http://www.abc.net.au/sundayprofile/stories/s1897086.htm|website = Sunday Profile, ABC|accessdate = 4 November 2015|date = 15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Australian Swimming Union suspended her for 10 years. They relented a few months before the 1968 Games but by then it was too late for Fraser, at 31, to prepare.

She later denied having swum the moat to steal the flag, telling ''The Times'' in 1991: &quot;There's no way I would have swum that moat. I was terrified of dirty water and that moat was filthy. There's no way I'd have dipped my toe in it.&quot;

Fraser became a publican at the [[Balmain, New South Wales#Drinking establishments|Riverview Hotel]], Balmain, and took up swimming coaching. In 1988, she was elected an independent Member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] (MLA) for the [[Electoral district of Balmain|seat of Balmain]]. Fraser left politics when the seat was abolished in 1991 and she failed to win the new seat of [[Electoral district of Port Jackson|Port Jackson]].&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ms Dawn Fraser (1937 – ) |work=Members of Parliament |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/1fb6ebed995667c2ca256ea100825164/00a1a2b97accf3e5ca256ce000034fc7 |accessdate=19 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fraser is a high-profile supporter and a board director of the [[Wests Tigers]] [[NRL]] club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/benji-marshall-good-natured-dawn-fraser/story-fn3dxity-1226121182177&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of the bearers of the [[Olympic Torch]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney. She carried the Olympic Torch at the stadium, as one of the bearers for the final segment, before the lighting of the [[Olympic Flame]].

The [[Australian Sport Awards]] includes an award named in honour of and presented by Fraser. In 1992, the [[State Transit Authority]] named a [[Sydney RiverCats|RiverCat ferry]] after Fraser.

==In film==
In 1979, a movie called ''[[Dawn!]]'' was made about Fraser's life and career. It starred Bronwyn Mackay-Payne as Fraser.

Fraser was played by [[Melissa Thomas]] in the 2003 film ''[[Swimming Upstream]]''. Fraser herself is credited in the film as Dawn Fraser's coach.
On  1 September 2015, Dawn Fraser featured on Season 7, Episode 5 of the [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] genealogy television series [[Who Do You Think You Are? (Australian TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]], which traced her heritage back to South America.

== Personal life ==
Fraser married Gary Ware on 30 January 1965 at St Stephens Church, Macquarie Street, Sydney.&lt;ref name=sl-pic-wedding&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hickson|first1=Jack |title=Dawn Fraser's wedding to Gary Ware, St. Stephen's Church, Sydney |url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=98512 |website=acms.sl.nsw.gov.au |date=30 January 1965 |publisher=State Library of NSW |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was short-lived. She has one daughter from the marriage, Dawn-Lorraine, who has a son, Jackson.&lt;ref name=abc-kicking&gt;{{cite interview |author=Fraser, Dawn |interviewer=Attard, Monica |title=Dawn Fraser: still kicking |url=http://www.abc.net.au/sundayprofile/stories/s1897086.htm|website=Sunday Profile www.abc.net.a|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=21 December 2014|date=15 April  2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smh-smiling&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hardy|first1=Karen |title=Dawn Fraser still smiling |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/dawn-fraser-still-smiling-20131213-2zarg.html |accessdate=21 December 2014 |work=The Sydney Morining Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser has drawn negative criticism for public comments such as, &quot;I'm sick and tired of the immigrants that are coming into my country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;smh.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/from-olympic-bans-to-one-nation-dawn-fraser-no-stranger-to-controversy-20150707-gi6sgw.html#ixzz3kkQ1HLXL|title=From Olympic bans to One Nation: Dawn Fraser no stranger to controversy|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; and telling two Australian tennis players to &quot;go back to where their fathers or parents came from.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;smh.com.au&quot;/&gt; These views have been described as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/olympic-legend-dawn-fraser-launches-racist-attack-on-nick-kyrgios/story-fnu2pjj2-1227431907759|title=Dawn Fraser attacks Nick Kyrgios after Wimbledon 2015 loss|date=7 July 2015|work=NewsComAu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/07/dawn-fraser-sorry-for-racist-outburst-on-nick-kyrgios-and-bernard-tomic |title=Dawn Fraser sorry for 'racist' outburst on Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic |date=July 7, 2015 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |access-date=August 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/dawn-frasers-comments-about-kyrgios-and-tomic-were-racist-say-experts-20150707-gi70b6.html |title=Dawn Fraser's comments about Kyrgios and Tomic were racist, say experts |first1=Angus |last1=Holland |date=July 7, 2015 |publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' |access-date=August 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently apologized.
