It is the least [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element.&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS, IT IS CORRECT. SEE THE FRANCIUM ARTICLE.

Caesium is mined mostly from [[pollucite]], while the [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]], especially [[caesium-137]], a [[fission product]], are extracted from waste produced by [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]].

The German chemist [[Robert Bunsen]] and physicist  [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of [[Atomic emission spectroscopy#Flame emission spectroscopy|flame spectroscopy]]. The first small-scale applications for caesium were as a &quot;[[getter]]&quot; in [[vacuum tube]]s and in [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]]. In 1967, acting on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] proof that the speed of light is the most constant dimension in the universe, the [[International System of Units]] used two specific wave counts from an [[emission spectrum]] of caesium-133 to co-define the [[second]] and the [[meter|metre]]. Since then, caesium has been widely used in highly accurate [[atomic clock]]s.

Since the 1990s, the largest [[#Applications|application of the element]] has been as [[caesium formate]] for [[drilling fluid]]s, but it has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry. The radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a [[half-life]] of about 30 years and is used in medical applications, industrial gauges, and hydrology. Although the element is only mildly [[Toxicity|toxic]], the metal is a hazardous material and the radioisotopes would present a significant health and ecological hazard in the environment.

===Chemical properties===
[[File:Cesium water.theora.ogv|left|thumb|Addition of a small amount of caesium to cold water is explosive.|alt=A person adds a small amount of metal to a petri dish with cold water which produces a small explosion.]]
Caesium metal is highly reactive and very [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]. It ignites spontaneously in air, and reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures, more so than the other alkali metals ([[Alkali metal|first group]] of the [[periodic table]]).&lt;!--YES INCLUDING FRANCIUM--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;  It reacts with solid water at temperatures as low as {{convert|−116|°C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Because of this high reactivity, caesium metal is classified as a [[hazardous material]]. It is stored and shipped in dry, saturated hydrocarbons such as [[mineral oil]]. It can be handled only under [[inert gas]], such as [[argon]]. However, a caesium-water explosion is often less powerful than a [[sodium]]-water explosion with a similar amount of sodium. This is because caesium explodes instantly upon contact with water, leaving little time for hydrogen to accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Theodore (2012) ''The Elements'', Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publishers, p. 131, ISBN 1-57912-895-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesium can be stored in vacuum-sealed [[borosilicate glass]] [[ampoule]]s. In quantities of more than about 100&amp;nbsp;grams (3.5&amp;nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]), caesium is shipped in hermetically sealed, stainless steel containers.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

The chemistry of caesium is similar to that of other alkali metals, in particular [[rubidium]], the element above caesium in the periodic table.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenwood&quot; /&gt; As expected for an alkali metal, the only common oxidation state is +1.{{refn|It differs from this value in caesides, which contain the Cs&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; anion and thus have caesium in the −1 oxidation state.&lt;ref name=caeside/&gt; Additionally, 2013 calculations by Mao-sheng Miao indicate that under conditions of extreme pressure (greater than 30&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|GPa]]), the inner 5p electrons could form chemical bonds, where caesium would behave as the seventh 5p element. This discovery indicates that higher caesium fluorides with caesium in oxidation states from +2 to +6 could exist under such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=A Basic Rule of Chemistry Can Be Broken, Calculations Show|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=chemical-bonds-inner-shell-electrons|work=Scientific American|accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=oxistates|group=note}} Some small differences arise from the fact that it has a higher [[atomic mass]] and is more [[Electronegativity|electropositive]] than other (nonradioactive) alkali metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 953–955|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first1 = Arnold F.|last1 = Holleman|last2 = Wiberg|first2 = Egon |last3 =Wiberg|first3 = Nils|chapter = Vergleichende Übersicht über die Gruppe der Alkalimetalle| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesium is the most electropositive chemical element.{{refn|[[Francium]]'s electropositivity has not been experimentally measured due to its high radioactivity.

Most caesium compounds contain the element as the [[cation]] {{chem|Cs|+}}, which [[ionic bond|binds ionically]] to a wide variety of [[anion]]s. One noteworthy exception is the [[alkalide|caeside]] anion ({{chem|Cs|−}}),&lt;ref name=caeside&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Angewandte Chemie|Angewandte Chemie International Edition]]|year = 1979|first = J.

Salts of Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are usually colourless unless the anion itself is coloured. Many of the simple salts are [[hygroscopic]], but less so than the corresponding salts of lighter alkali metals. The [[phosphate]],&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. M. (2011). {{Wayback |date=20121025180158 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Phosphate?topic=49557 |title=Phosphate}} in ''Encyclopedia of Earth''. Jorgensen, A. and Cleveland, C.J. (eds.). National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; [[acetate]], [[carbonate]], [[halide]]s, [[oxide]], [[nitrate]], and [[sulfate]] salts are water-soluble. [[Double salt]]s are often less soluble, and the low solubility of caesium aluminium sulfate is exploited in refining Cs from ores. The double salt with antimony (such as {{chem|CsSbCl|4}}), [[bismuth]], [[cadmium]], [[copper]], [[iron]], and [[lead]] are also poorly [[Dissolution (chemistry)|soluble]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

A [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] mixture of caesium and [[gold]] will react to form yellow [[caesium auride]] (Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Au&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) upon heating. The auride anion here behaves as a [[pseudohalogen]]. The compound reacts violently with water, yielding [[caesium hydroxide]], metallic gold, and hydrogen gas; in liquid ammonia it can be reacted with a caesium-specific ion exchange resin to produce tetramethylammonium auride. The analogous [[platinum]] compound, red caesium platinide (Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt), contains the platinide ion that behaves as a pseudo[[chalcogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of relativistic motion of electrons on the chemistry of gold and platinum|journal=Solid State Sciences|date=2005-11-30|volume=7|issue=12|pages=1464–1474|doi=10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2005.06.015|last=Jansen|first=Martin|bibcode = 2005SSSci...7.1464J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complexes====
Like all metal cations, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; forms complexes with [[Lewis base]]s in solution. Because of its large size, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; usually adopts [[coordination number]]s greater than 6, the number typical for the smaller alkali metal cations. This difference is apparent in the 8-coordination of CsCl. This high coordination number and [[HSAB|softness]] (tendency to form covalent bonds) are properties exploited in separating Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from other cations in the remediation of nuclear wastes, where &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; must be separated from large amounts of nonradioactive K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moyer |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Birdwell |first2=Joseph F. |last3=Bonnesen |first3=Peter V. |last4=Delmau |first4=Laetitia H. |work=Macrocyclic Chemistry |pages=383–405 |date=2005 |doi=10.1007/1-4020-3687-6_24 |title=Use of Macrocycles in Nuclear-Waste Cleanup: A Realworld Application of a Calixcrown in Cesium Separation Technology |isbn=1-4020-3364-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesium has 39 known [[isotope]]s, ranging in [[mass number]] (i.e. number of [[nucleon]]s in the nucleus) from 112 to 151. Several of these are synthesized from lighter elements by the slow neutron capture process ([[S-process]]) inside old stars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.37.1.239|author=Busso, M.|author2=Gallino, R.|author3=Wasserburg, G.

The radioactive [[caesium-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]] has a very long half-life of about 2.3&amp;nbsp;million years, longest of all radioactive isotopes of caesium.

The isotopes with mass numbers of 129, 131, 132 and 136, have half-lives between a day and two weeks, while most of the other isotopes have half-lives from a few seconds to fractions of a second. At least 21 metastable [[nuclear isomer]]s exist.

Caesium is a relatively rare element estimated to average 3&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] in the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turekian|first1=K.K.|last2=Wedepohl|first2=K.

Nevertheless, it is more abundant than such elements as [[antimony]], [[cadmium]], [[tin]], and [[tungsten]], and two orders of magnitude more abundant than mercury and [[silver]]; it is 3.3% as abundant as [[rubidium]], with which it is closely associated, chemically.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

Due to its large [[ionic radius]], caesium is one of the &quot;[[incompatible element]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asi.org/adb/02/13/02/cesium-occurrence-uses.html|title=Cesium as a Raw Material: Occurrence and Uses|first=Simon|last=Rowland|publisher=Artemis Society International|date=1998-07-04|accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|magma crystallization]], caesium is concentrated in the liquid phase and crystallizes last. Therefore, the largest deposits of caesium are zone [[pegmatite]] ore bodies formed by this enrichment process. Because caesium does not substitute for [[potassium]] as readily as rubidium, the alkali evaporite minerals [[sylvite]] (KCl) and [[carnallite]] ({{chem|KMgCl|3|·6H|2|O}}) may contain only 0.002% caesium. Consequently, Cs is found in few minerals.

==Production==
Mining and refining pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a smaller scale than for most other metals. The ore is crushed, hand-sorted, but not usually concentrated, and then ground. Caesium is then extracted from pollucite primarily by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burt&gt;{{cite book|last = Burt|first = R. O.|date = 1993|chapter = Caesium and cesium compounds|title = Kirk-Othmer encyclopedia of chemical technology|edition = 4th|place = New York|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|volume = 5|pages = 749–764|isbn = 978-0-471-48494-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the acid digestion, the [[silicate]] pollucite rock is dissolved with strong acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] (HCl), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}), [[hydrobromic acid|hydrobromic]] (HBr), or [[hydrofluoric acid|hydrofluoric]] (HF) acids. With hydrochloric acid, a mixture of soluble chlorides is produced, and the insoluble chloride double salts of caesium are precipitated as caesium antimony chloride ({{chem|Cs|4|SbCl|7}}), caesium iodine chloride ({{chem|Cs|2|ICl}}), or caesium hexachlorocerate ({{chem|Cs|2|(CeCl|6|)}}). After separation, the pure precipitated double salt is decomposed, and pure CsCl is precipitated by evaporating the water.

The sulfuric acid method yields the insoluble double salt directly as caesium [[alum]] ({{chem|CsAl(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O}}). The [[aluminium sulfate]] component is converted to insoluble [[aluminium oxide]] by roasting the alum with [[carbon]], and the resulting product is [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] with water to yield a {{chem|Cs|2|SO|4}} solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

Roasting pollucite with [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium chloride]] yields insoluble calcium silicates and soluble caesium chloride. Leaching with water or dilute [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|4|OH}}) yields a dilute chloride (CsCl) solution. This solution can be evaporated to produce caesium chloride or transformed into caesium alum or caesium carbonate. Though not commercially feasible, the ore can be directly reduced with potassium, sodium, or calcium in vacuum can produce caesium metal directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

Most of the mined caesium (as salts) is directly converted into [[formate|caesium formate]] (HCOO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) for applications such as [[oil drilling]]. To supply the developing market, [[Cabot Corporation]] built a production plant in 1997 at the Tanco mine near Bernic Lake in Manitoba, with a capacity of {{convert|12000|oilbbl|m3}} per year of caesium formate solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Benton|first1 = William|last2 = Turner| first2 = Jim|date = 2000|title = Cesium formate fluid succeeds in North Sea HPHT field trials|journal = Drilling Contractor|issue = May/June|pages = 38–41|url = http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-mayjun00/m-cabot.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary smaller-scale commercial compounds of caesium are [[caesium chloride]] and [[Caesium nitrate|nitrate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CEC&quot; /&gt;

Alternatively, caesium metal may be obtained from the purified compounds derived from the ore. Caesium chloride and the other caesium halides can be reduced at {{convert|700|to|800|°C|°F}} with calcium or [[barium]], and caesium metal distilled from the result. In the same way, the aluminate, carbonate, or hydroxide may be reduced by [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kirchhoff Bunsen Roscoe.jpg|thumb|[[Gustav Kirchhoff]] (left) and [[Robert Bunsen]] (centre) discovered caesium with their newly invented spectroscope.| alt= Three middle-aged men, with the one in the middle sitting down. All wear long jackets, and the shorter man on the left has a beard.]]
In 1860, [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered caesium in the [[mineral water]] from [[Bad Dürkheim|Dürkheim]], Germany. Because of the bright blue lines in the [[emission spectrum]], they derived the name from the [[Latin]] word ''caesius'', meaning sky-blue.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Bunsen quotes [[Aulus Gellius]] [[Aulus Gellius|Noctes Atticae]] II, 26 by [[Nigidius Figulus]]: ''Nostris autem veteribus caesia dicts est quae Graecis, ut Nigidus ait, de colore coeli quasi coelia.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BuKi1861&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = The discovery of the elements.

To obtain a pure sample of caesium, {{convert|44,000|litre}} of mineral water had to be evaporated to yield {{convert|240|kg}} of concentrated salt solution. The [[alkaline earth metal]]s were precipitated either as sulfates or [[oxalate]]s, leaving the alkali metal in the solution. After conversion to the [[nitrate]]s and extraction with [[ethanol]], a sodium-free mixture was obtained. From this mixture, the lithium was precipitated by [[ammonium carbonate]]. Potassium, rubidium, and caesium form insoluble salts with [[chloroplatinic acid]], but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water, and the less-soluble caesium and rubidium hexachloroplatinate ((Cs,Rb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) were obtained by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]]. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with [[hydrogen]], caesium and rubidium were separated by the difference in solubility of their carbonates in alcohol. The process yielded {{convert|9.2|g}} of [[rubidium chloride]] and {{convert|7.3|g}} of caesium chloride from the initial 44,000&amp;nbsp;litres of mineral water.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuKi1861&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Chemische Analyse durch Spectralbeobachtungen |pages = 337–381 |first1 = G.|last1 = Kirchhoff |first2 = R.|last2 = Bunsen|authorlink1 = Gustav Kirchhoff|authorlink2 = Robert Bunsen|doi = 10.1002/andp.18611890702 |journal = [[Annalen der Physik|Annalen der Physik und Chemie]] |volume = 189 |issue = 7|date = 1861|bibcode = 1861AnP...189..337K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the caesium chloride, the two scientists estimated the [[atomic weight]] of the new element at 123.35 (compared to the currently accepted one of 132.9).&lt;ref name=&quot;BuKi1861&quot; /&gt; They tried to generate elemental caesium by electrolysis of molten caesium chloride, but instead of a metal, they obtained a blue homogeneous substance which &quot;neither under the naked eye nor under the microscope&quot; showed the slightest trace of metallic substance&quot;; as a result, they assigned it as a [[Non-stoichiometric compound|subchloride]] ({{chem|Cs|2|Cl}}).

Historically, the most important use for caesium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical fields. Very few applications existed for caesium until the 1920s, when it came into use in radio [[vacuum tube]]s, where it had two functions; as a [[getter]], it removed excess oxygen after manufacture, and as a coating on the heated [[cathode]], it increased the [[electrical conductivity]]. Caesium was not recognized as a high-performance industrial metal until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Strod|first = A.J.|date = 1957|title = Cesium—A new industrial metal|journal = American Ceramic Bulletin|volume = 36|issue = 6| pages = 212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications for nonradioactive caesium included [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], [[photomultiplier]] tubes, optical components of [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometers]], catalysts for several organic reactions, crystals for [[scintillation counter]]s, and in [[MHD generator|magnetohydrodynamic power generators]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt; Caesium also was, and still is, used as a source of positive ions in [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS).

Since 1967, the [[International System of Units|International System of Measurements]] has based the primary unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles at the [[microwave]] [[frequency]] of the [[spectral line]] corresponding to the transition between two [[hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] [[energy level]]s of the [[ground state]] of [[caesium-133]].&lt;ref name=USNO&gt;{{cite web|title=Cesium Atoms at Work |publisher=Time Service Department—U.S. Naval Observatory—Department of the Navy |url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223231150/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html |archivedate=February 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] of 1967 defined a second as: &quot;the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of caesium-133 atoms in their ground state undisturbed by external fields&quot;.

==Applications==
===Petroleum exploration===&lt;!-- linked from &quot;Formate&quot; article --&gt;
The largest present-day use of nonradioactive caesium is in [[formate|caesium formate]] [[drilling fluid]]s for the [[extractive oil industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt; Aqueous solutions of caesium formate (HCOO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)—made by reacting caesium hydroxide with [[formic acid]]—were developed in the mid-1990s for use as oil well drilling and [[completion (oil and gas wells)|completion fluids]]. The function of a drilling fluid is to lubricate drill bits, to bring rock cuttings to the surface, and to maintain pressure on the formation during drilling of the well. Completion fluids assist the emplacement of control hardware after drilling but prior to production by maintaining the pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

Unlike the components of many other heavy liquids, caesium formate is relatively environment-friendly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Down&quot; /&gt; Caesium formate brine can be blended with potassium and sodium formates to decrease the density of the fluids to that of water (1.0&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 8.3&amp;nbsp;pounds per gallon). Furthermore, it is biodegradable and may be recycled, which is important in view of its high cost (about $4,000&amp;nbsp;per [[Barrel (volume)#Oil barrel|barrel]] in 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Flatern|first = Rick|date = 2001|title = Keeping cool in the HPHT environment|journal = Offshore Engineer|issue = February|pages = 33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkali formates are safe to handle and do not damage the producing formation or downhole metals as corrosive alternative, high-density brines (such as [[zinc bromide]] {{Chem|ZnBr|2}} solutions) sometimes do; they also require less cleanup and reduce disposal costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

===Electric power and electronics===
Caesium vapour [[thermionic converter|thermionic generators]] are low-power devices that convert heat energy to electrical energy. In the two-electrode [[vacuum tube]] converter, caesium neutralizes the space charge near the cathode and enhances the current flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Rasor| first1 = Ned S.| first2 = Charles|last2 =Warner| title = Correlation of Emission Processes for Adsorbed Alkali Films on Metal Surfaces| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 35| issue = 9| pages = 2589–2600| date = September 1964|doi = 10.1063/1.1713806|bibcode = 1964JAP....35.2589R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesium is also important for its [[Photoelectric effect|photoemissive]] properties, converting light to electron flow. It is used in [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]] because caesium-based cathodes, such as the intermetallic compound {{chem|K|2|CsSb}}, have a low threshold voltage for emission of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanelements.com/cs.html |title=Cesium Supplier &amp; Technical Information |publisher=American Elements |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of photoemissive devices using caesium include [[optical character recognition]] devices, [[photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]], and [[video camera tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.3215593|title = K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsSb Cathode Development| journal = AIP Conference Proceedings |date = 2009|volume = 1149| pages = 1062–1066|first1 =John|last1 = Smedley| first2 =Triveni|last2 = Rao| first3 =Erdong|last3 = Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = P.|last = Görlich|title = Über zusammengesetzte, durchsichtige Photokathoden|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 101|pages = 335–342|date =1936|doi =10.1007/BF01342330|bibcode = 1936ZPhy..101..335G|issue = 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[germanium]], rubidium, selenium, silicon, tellurium, and several other elements can be substituted for caesium in photosensitive materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

[[Caesium iodide]] (CsI), [[caesium bromide|bromide]] (CsBr) and caesium fluoride (CsF) crystals are employed for [[scintillator]]s in [[scintillation counter]]s widely used in mineral exploration and particle physics research to detect [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[X-ray]] radiation. Being a heavy element, caesium provides good stopping power with better detection. Caesium compounds may provide a faster response (CsF) and be less hygroscopic (CsI).

Caesium vapour is used in many common [[magnetometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s00340-005-1773-x|title = Comparison of discharge lamp and laser pumped cesium magnetometers|date = 2005|last1 = Groeger|first1 = S.|first2 = A.

===Centrifugation fluids===
The high density of the caesium ion makes solutions of caesium chloride, caesium sulfate, and caesium [[trifluoroacetic acid|trifluoroacetate]] ({{chem|Cs(O|2|CCF|3|)}}) useful in molecular biology for density gradient [[Differential centrifugation|ultracentrifugation]].&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Bick, Horst Prinz, &quot;Cesium and Cesium Compounds&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06 153}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This technology is used primarily in the isolation of [[virus|viral particles]], subcellular [[organelle]]s and fractions, and [[nucleic acid]]s from biological samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=1kn89nI2gUsC&amp;pg=PA61|pages = 61–62|isbn = 978-0-89603-564-5|chapter = Gradient Materials|editor =Desai, Mohamed A.|date = 2000|publisher = Humana Press|location = Totowa, N.J.|title = Downstream processing methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear and isotope applications===
[[Caesium-137]] is a [[Radionuclide|radioisotope]] commonly used as a [[gamma ray|gamma]]-emitter in industrial applications. Its advantages include a half-life of roughly 30 years, its availability from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], and having [[Isotopes of barium|&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Ba]] as a stable end product. The high water solubility is a disadvantage which makes it incompatible with large pool irradiators for food and medical supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takeshi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth1.epa.gov/radiation/docs/source-management/csfinallongtakeshi.pdf |title=The material flow of radioactive cesium-137 in the U.S. 2000 |first=Takeshi |last=Okumura |date=2003-10-21 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-20 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720163223/http://earth1.epa.gov/radiation/docs/source-management/csfinallongtakeshi.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in agriculture, cancer treatment, and the [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of food, sewage sludge, and surgical equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Jensen|first = N.

Isotope 137 has been used in [[hydrology|hydrologic]] studies analogous to those with [[tritium]]. As a daughter product of fission bomb testing from the 1950s through the mid-1980s, caesium-137 was released into the atmosphere, where it was absorbed readily into solution. Known year-to-year variation within that period allows correlation with soil and sediment layers. Caesium-134, and to a lesser extent caesium-135, have also been used in hydrology to measure the caesium output by the nuclear power industry.

Caesium and mercury were used as a propellant in early [[ion thruster|ion engines]] designed for [[spacecraft propulsion]] on very long interplanetary or extraplanetary missions. The fuel was ionized by contact with a charged [[tungsten]] electrode.

Nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic and nonradioactive caesium is not a significant environmental hazard.

Caesium metal is one of the most reactive elements and is highly [[explosive material|explosive]] in the presence of water. The hydrogen gas produced by the reaction is heated by the thermal energy released at the same time, causing ignition and a violent explosion. This can occur with other alkali metals, but caesium is so potent that this explosive reaction can be triggered even by cold water.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt;

It is highly [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]: the [[autoignition temperature]] of caesium is −116&amp;nbsp;°C, and it ignites explosively in air to form [[caesium hydroxide]] and various oxides. Caesium hydroxide is a very strong [[base (chemistry)|base]], and will rapidly corrode glass.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/55/caesium|accessdate=2010-09-27|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|title=Chemical Data – Caesium – Cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[isotope]]s [[Caesium-134|134]] and 137 are present in the [[biosphere]] in small amounts from human activities, differing by location. Radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as readily as other fission products (such as radioiodine and radiostrontium). About 10% of absorbed radiocaesium washes out of the body relatively quickly in sweat and urine. The remaining 90% has a biological half-life between 50 and 150 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=British Journal of Radiology|title=A Survey of the Metabolism of Caesium in Man|date=1964|last1=Rundo|issue=434|pages=108–114|doi=10.1259/0007-1285-37-434-108|first1=J.|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiocaesium follows potassium and tends to accumulate in plant tissues, including fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF01376226|title = Accumulation of Cs and K and growth of bean plants in nutrient solution and soils|date = 1962|last1 = Nishita|first1 = H.|last2 = Dixon|first2 = D.|last3 = Larson|first3 = K.
