The '''Scottish Parliament Building''' ({{lang-gd|Pàrlamaid na h-Alba}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/gd/index.aspx |title=Dachaigh : Pàrlamaid na h-Alba |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-sco|Scots Pairlament Biggin}}) is the home of the [[Scottish Parliament]] at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]], within the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in central [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Audit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/2000/00g01ag.pdf |format=PDF|title=The New Scottish Parliament at Holyrood |publisher=Audit Scotland, Sep 2000 |accessdate=2006-12-10|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061206171310/http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/2000/00g01ag.pdf |archivedate = 6 December 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Construction]] of the building commenced in June 1999 and the [[Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs) held their first debate in the new building on 7 September 2004. The formal opening by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] took place on 9 October 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Opening&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/events/holyroodOpening/index.htm |title=Opening of Holyrood |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504024309/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/events/holyroodOpening/index.htm |archivedate=4 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enric Miralles]], the Spanish [[Catalan People|Catalan]] architect who designed the building, died before its completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Death&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |title=Scots Parliament architect dies |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/817635.stm|work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2000-07-03 |accessdate=2006-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1999 until the opening of the new building in 2004, committee rooms and the [[debating chamber]] of the Scottish Parliament were housed in the [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly Hall]] of the [[Church of Scotland]] located on [[The Mound]] in Edinburgh. Office and administrative accommodation in support of the Parliament were provided in buildings leased from the [[City of Edinburgh Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Old&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Scotland's Parliament to start life in General Assembly Hall |url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/1998/03/38dc8ff7-3ec7-46aa-829a-e87a72c2f3ad |publisher=Scottish Office |date=20 March 1998 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new Scottish Parliament Building brought together these different elements into one purpose-built parliamentary complex, housing 129 MSPs and more than 1,000 staff and [[civil servants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Scotland+the+brave%3A+operatic+in+both+conception+and+execution,...-a0126075995 |author=Catherine Slessor |date=November 2004| title=Scotland the brave: operatic in both conception and execution, Scotland's long awaited new parliament will help a fledgling institution to mature and evolve |publisher=Architecture Review |accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the outset, the building and its construction have been controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Queen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |title=Speech by HM The Queen on the opening of the New Scottish Parliament building |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Speechesandarticles/2004/TheQueenopensthenewScottishParliamentbuildinginEdi.aspx |work=&quot;Certainly this new parliament building has had a difficult and controversial birth&quot; |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |date=2004-10-09 |accessdate=2014-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111115429/http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Speechesandarticles/2004/TheQueenopensthenewScottishParliamentbuildinginEdi.aspx |archivedate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The choices of location, architect, design, and construction company were all criticised by [[Politics of Scotland|politicians]], the [[Scottish media|media]] and the Scottish public. Scheduled to open in 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPaper&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn03357.pdf |format=PDF| title=House of Commons Research Paper - Building the Scottish Parliament, The Holyrood Project |author=Isobel White |author2=Iqwinder Sidhu  |publisher=House of Commons Library, 2005-01-12 |accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it did so in 2004, more than three years late with an estimated final cost of £414 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;414million&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-07/pa07-018.htm |title=Closure of Holyrood Project |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2007-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226194935/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-07/pa07-018.htm |archivedate=26 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many times higher than initial estimates of between £10m and £40m.  A major [[public inquiry]] into the handling of the construction, chaired by the former [[Lord Advocate]], [[Peter Fraser, Baron Fraser of Carmyllie|Peter Fraser]], was established in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPaper&quot;/&gt; The inquiry concluded in September 2004 and criticised the management of the whole project from the realisation of cost increases down to the way in which major design changes were implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;FraserSpeech&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=

The building aimed to achieve a poetic union between the [[Geography of Scotland|Scottish landscape]], its [[Scottish people|people]], its [[Scottish culture|culture]], and the city of Edinburgh. The parliament building won numerous awards including the 2005 [[Stirling Prize]] and has been described by landscape architect [[Charles Jencks]] as &quot;a tour de force of arts and crafts and quality without parallel in the last 100 years of [[British architecture]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunday herald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jencks&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/Articles/view.php?id=23084 |title=Identity parade: Miralles and the Scottish parliament: On the architectural territories of the EMBT/RMJM parliament building |work=[[Architecture Today]]| volume=154| pages=32–44 |date=January 2005 |author=Charles Jencks |accessdate=2007-01-07| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009045338/http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/Articles/view.php?id=23084| archivedate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

Comprising an area of 1.6&amp;nbsp;[[hectare|ha]] (4 acres), with a perimeter of 480&amp;nbsp;m (1570&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref name=&quot;Site&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/16007.aspx |title=About the building: Project History: Site Selected |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Scottish Parliament building is located 1&amp;nbsp;km (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi) east of Edinburgh city centre on the edge of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Map&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?scale=5000&amp;lon=-3.174722&amp;lat=55.951944 |title=Map of location of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh |publisher=Multimap |accessdate=2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large site previously housed the headquarters of the [[Scottish and Newcastle]] brewery which were demolished to make way for the building. The boundary of the site is marked by the [[Canongate]] stretch of the [[Royal Mile]] on its northern side, Horse Wynd on its eastern side, where the public entrance to the building is, and Reid's Close on its western side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bounded&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/1998/01/f3a0dd04-e2af-4dbd-9b05-bd94b976b5bf |title=Scottish Parliament to be built at Holyrood |publisher=Scottish Office |date=9 January 1998 |accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid's Close connects the Canongate and Holyrood Road on the southwestern side of the complex. The south eastern side of the complex is bounded by the [[Our Dynamic Earth]] visitor attraction which opened in July 1999, and Queen's Drive which fringes the slopes of the [[Salisbury Crags]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arup&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arup.com/DOWNLOADBANK/download383.pdf |format=PDF| title=Scottish Parliament Building Edinburgh |publisher=Arup |accessdate=2006-12-07| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323202929/http://www.arup.com/DOWNLOADBANK/download383.pdf| archivedate=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immediate vicinity of the building is the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]], which is bordered by the broad expanse of [[Holyrood Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bounded&quot;/&gt; To the south of the parliamentary complex are the steep slopes of the Salisbury Crags and [[Arthur's Seat]]. The Holyrood and Dumbiedykes areas, to the west of the site, have been extensively redeveloped since 1998, with new retail, hotel and office developments, including Barclay House, the new offices of [[The Scotsman Publications Ltd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt;

== Project history ==
Before 1707, the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] was a [[Sovereignty|sovereign independent state]] which had its own legislature—the [[Parliament of Scotland]]—which met, latterly, at [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The [[Treaty of Union 1707|Treaty of Union]], signed in 1707, created an incorporating [[political union]] between the Kingdom of Scots and the Kingdom of England. The two previous Acts of Union (one for the British Parliament and one for the Parliament of Scotland) had dissolved the previous parliaments. The Treaty of Union created the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] which was housed in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]]. As a consequence, Scotland was directly governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a Parliament building of its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoricalConnection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/history/firstscottishparliament/index.htm |title=The First Scottish Parliament: the Middle Ages – 1707 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514222228/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/history/firstscottishparliament/index.htm |archivedate=14 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure for an independent parliament grew in the 1970s with the growth of the [[Scottish National Party]] and monies were invested into the conversion of the former Royal High School on Calton Hill into an official parliament. Whilst much of this conversion was completed (including creation of the main debating hall) and the building was renamed [[New Parliament House, Edinburgh|New Parliament House]] it was determined that the facility was too small for its stated purpose (as and when that purpose arose). Following the April 1992 election, when a weakened John Major was re-elected, a campaign group set up adjacent to the Royal High School at the foot of the access road to Calton Hill. Starting informally this became a permanently manned &quot;vigil&quot; to keep the concept in the public mind. This led to the Royal High School being the &quot;popular&quot; choice of site in the public (and particularly SNP) mindset.

A [[Scotland referendum, 1997|referendum]] of the Scottish electorate, held on 11 September 1997, approved the establishment of a directly-elected Scottish Parliament to legislate on most domestic affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;devolvedgovt&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=

The red tiles of [[Queensberry House]] are visible between the MSP Office block at the back of the complex and the Tower and Canongate Buildings at the front which house the debating chamber and committee rooms.]]

Initially, three sites in and around Edinburgh were considered as possible locations for the building, including [[St Andrew's House]]/New Parliament House (better known as the imposing former Royal High School on Calton Hill) St Andrews House being the home of the Scottish Office—later the [[Scottish Government]]; [[Victoria Quay, Scotland|Victoria Quay]] at [[Leith]] docks (adjacent to the major Scottish Office building there) and [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]] on the vacant railway goods yard, in the west end of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choosingasite&quot;/&gt; The Holyrood site was not entered into the picture until after the official closure date of the competition between the three sites. The date for announcing the winner overran and on the date of the expected announcement instead it was announced that they were going to &quot;rethink their decision&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Dewar:press statement BBC news, 1997-12-08&lt;/ref&gt; (inferring that indeed a decision had been made) and add the Holyrood Brewery site into the running (which had only just closed).&lt;ref name=&quot;HolyroodSite&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/1997/12/843c1de0-9ac1-4e03-bd0b-9dcef8f65589 |title=Holyrood Site added to Parliament Short List |publisher=Scottish Office| date=8 December 1997 |accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However negotiations with the brewing company [[Scottish and Newcastle]], who owned the land, resulted in the company indicating that they would be able to vacate the site in early 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;HolyroodSite&quot;/&gt; As a consequence, the Secretary of State for Scotland agreed that the Holyrood site merited inclusion on the shortlist of proposed locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choosingasite&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HolyroodSite&quot;/&gt; The Scottish Office commissioned feasibility studies of the specified areas in late 1997 and in January 1998, the Holyrood site was selected from the shortlist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Timeline:Holyrood |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3210729.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=13 September 2004 |accessdate=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from the site selection, the Scottish Office announced that an international competition would be held to find a designer for a new building to house the Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;DesignTeam&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/1998/05/c8a94e8f-4fa2-479b-b9d7-a64560f7aad8 |title=Final Five Design Teams for Holyrood Parliament named |publisher=Scottish Office |date=7 May 1998 |accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A design committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Dewar, and was tasked with choosing from a shortlist of designs. Proposals were submitted from internationally renowned architects such as [[Rafael Viñoly]], [[Michael Wilford]] and [[Richard Meier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt; Twelve designs were selected in March 1998, which were whittled down to five by the following May. The five final designs were put on public display throughout Scotland in June 1998. Feedback from the public displays showed that the designs of the Spanish architect [[Enric Miralles]] were amongst the most popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choosingasite&quot;/&gt; The design team took account of public opinion on the designs and invited all five shortlisted entrants to make presentations on their proposed designs before announcing a winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choosingasite&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|We don't want to forget that the Scottish Parliament will be in Edinburgh, but will belong to Scotland, to the Scottish land. The Parliament should be able to reflect the land it represents. The building should arise from the sloping base of [[Arthur's Seat]] and arrive into the city almost surging out of the rock.|Enric Miralles, 1999&lt;ref name = &quot;EMBT&quot;/&gt;}}
Miralles sought to design a parliament building that could represent and present a [[Scottish national identity|national identity]]. This intractably difficult question was tackled by displacing the question of identity into the landscape of Scotland. In a characteristically poetic approach he talked about slotting the building into the land &quot;in the form of a gathering situation: an [[amphitheatre]], coming out from Arthur's Seat.&quot; where the building would reflect a dialogue between the landscape and the act of people sitting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jencks&quot;/&gt; So an early goal of the design was to open the building and its public spaces, not just to Edinburgh but to a more general concept of the Scottish landscape. Miralles intended to use the parliament to help build the end of Canongate—&quot;not just another building on the street...it should reinforce the existing qualities of the site and its surroundings. In a subtle game of cross views and political implications.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;work&quot;&gt;Miralles, Enric - Work in Progress&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was a non-hierarchical, organic collection of low-lying buildings intended to allow views of, and blend in with, the surrounding rugged scenery and symbolise the connection between [[Wildlife of Scotland|nature]] and the Scottish people.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdinburghArchitecture&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburgharchitecture.co.uk/scottish_parliament.htm |title=Scottish Parliament |publisher=Edinburgh Architecture |accessdate=2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence the building has many features connected to nature and land, such as the leaf shaped motifs of the roof in the Garden Lobby of the building, and the large windows of the debating chamber, committee rooms and the Tower Buildings which face the broad expanse of Holyrood Park, Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMBT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mirallestagliabue.com/ |title=Scottish Parliament - concept |publisher=EMBT Architects |accessdate=2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the buildings, the connection to the land is reinforced by the use of [[Geology of Scotland|Scottish rock]] such as [[gneiss]] and [[granite]] in the flooring and walls, and the use of [[oak]] and [[sycamore]] in the construction of the furniture.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt;

The Parliament is actually a campus of several buildings, reflecting different architectural styles, with a total floor area of 31,000&amp;nbsp;square metres (312,000&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref name=&quot;Size&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arup.com/europe/project.cfm?pageid=4727 |title=Scottish Parliament, Holyrood, Edinburgh |publisher=Arup |accessdate=2006-10-30|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061016210222/http://www.arup.com/europe/project.cfm?pageid=4727 |archivedate = 16 October 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing accommodation for MSPs, their researchers and parliamentary staff. The buildings have a variety of features, with the most distinctive external characterisation being the roof of the Tower Buildings, said to be reminiscent of upturned boats on the shoreline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galinsky&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=

The north-western boundaries of the site, the MSPs' building, Queensberry House and the Canongate Building reinforce the existing medieval street patterns &quot;expressing intimacy with the city and its citizens&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt; The south-eastern aspect of the complex is extensively landscaped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arup&quot;/&gt; Concrete &quot;branches&quot;, covered in turf and wild grass extend from the parliamentary buildings, and provide members of the public with somewhere to sit and relax.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt; Indigenous Scottish wildflowers and plants cover much of the area, blending the Parliament's grounds with the nearby Holyrood Park and Salisbury Crags.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arup&quot;/&gt; Oak, Rowan, Lime and Cherry trees have also been planted in the grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arup&quot;/&gt; Adjacent to the landscaped area of the complex, where it meets Horse Wynd, there is an open plan piazza, with bike racks, seating and external lighting shaped like rocks incorporated into concrete paving. Three distinctive water features provide the centrepiece for this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arup&quot;/&gt;

[[File:The Skating Minister.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Henry Raeburn]]'s painting of [[The Skating Minister]]]]
[[File:Scottish parliament elevation.JPG|thumb|right|&quot;Trigger panels&quot; either an abstract of the skating minister or curtains drawn back from the windows.]]
References to Scottish culture are also reflected in the building and particularly on some of the building's elevations. There are a series of &quot;trigger panels&quot;, constructed out of timber or granite. Not to everyone's taste,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Jencks discussed Miralles &quot;Piling on the motifs and designs&quot; whilst Catherine Slessor writing in the Architectural review says &quot;The cut-outs, in both dark granite and slatted timber, give the elevations a curious appliqué quality and add to the general visual hecticness&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; these have been said to represent [[anvil]]s, hairdryers, guns, question marks or even the [[hammer and sickle]]. Shortly after the official opening of the building, Enric Miralles' widow, [[Benedetta Tagliabue]], revealed that the design is simply that of a window curtain pulled back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedetta&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Swanson |title=Benedetta lifts curtain on mystery |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/benedetta-lifts-curtain-on-mystery-1-1043586 |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=Scotsman |date=15 October 2004 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her late husband however, enjoying the use of ambiguous forms with multiple meanings, had previously said he would love the profile to evoke an icon of Scottish culture, the painting of [[The Skating Minister|Reverend Walker skating on ice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;work&quot;/&gt; The architectural critic [[Charles Jencks]] finds this a particularly apt [[metaphor]] for balanced movement and democratic debate and also notes the irony that Miralles too was skating on ice with his designs for the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jencks&quot;/&gt; Elsewhere, in the public area beneath the debating chamber, the curved concrete vaults carry various stylised [[Flag of Scotland|Saltires]]. Here the architect intends another metaphor; by setting the debating chamber directly above the public area, he seeks to remind MSPs whilst sitting in the chamber that their power derives from the people below them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt;

The Scottish Parliament Building is open to visitors all year round. On non-sitting days, normally Mondays, Fridays and weekends as well as during parliamentary recess periods, visitors are able to view the Main Hall of the building and can access the public galleries of the debating chamber and main committee rooms. Guided tours are also available on non-sitting days and these allow visitors access to the floor of the chamber, the Garden Lobby, [[Queensberry House]] and committee rooms in the company of a parliamentary guide. On sitting days, members of the public must purchase tickets for the public galleries of both the chamber and committee rooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visiting&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/visiting-the-parliament.aspx |title=Visiting the Parliament |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainability ===
[[File:Scottish Parliament, from Salisbury Crags.jpg|thumb|Roof line of the Parliament intended to evoke the crags of the [[Scottish landscape]] and, in places, upturned [[Fishing industry in Scotland|fishing boats]]. [[Photovoltaic module|Solar panels]] can also be seen, part of the building's [[sustainability]] strategy.]]
The Scottish Parliament Building was designed with a number of sustainability features in mind.  The decision to build the Parliament on a [[brownfield]] site and its proximity to hubs of [[Transport in Scotland|public transport]] are seen as sustainable, environmentally friendly features. All of the electricity purchased for the building comes from renewable sources and [[Solar hot water panel|solar panels]] on the Canongate Building are used for heating water in the complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainable features&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/18794.aspx |title= Environmental Management at the Scottish Parliament: Sustainable building features |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high level of insulation was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat and the use of computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive [[HVAC]] systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature in different parts of the Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day.This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25&amp;nbsp;metres (80&amp;nbsp;ft) deep [[bore hole]]s beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the [[Building Research Establishment]]'s Environmental Assessment Method ([[BREEAM]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jencks&quot;/&gt;

=== Debating chamber ===
[[File:Scotland Parliament Holyrood.jpg|right|thumb|View of the roofing structure of the debating chamber, where seating is arranged in a [[hemicycle (chamber)|hemicycle]] rather than the adversarial layout of other [[Westminster System|Westminster style legislatures]]]]
The debating chamber contains a shallow elliptical horseshoe of seating for the MSPs, with the governing party or parties sitting in the middle of the [[Hemicycle (chamber)|semicircle]] and opposition parties on either side, similar to other European legislatures. Such a layout is intended to blur political divisions and principally reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChamberSeating&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/PublicInformationdocuments/WHITDC_071013.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Scottish Parliament Debating Chamber |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the &quot;adversarial&quot; layout reminiscent of other [[Westminster System|Westminster style national legislatures]], including the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], where government and opposition sit apart and facing one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adversarial&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/educationprog/leaflets/guide_partb.htm |title=History and Architecture of Parliament Buildings |publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926054148/http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/educationprog/leaflets/guide_partb.htm |archivedate=26 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 131 desks and chairs on the floor of the chamber for all the elected members of the Scottish Parliament and members of the Scottish Government. The desks are constructed out of oak and sycamore and are fitted with a lectern, a microphone and in-built speakers as well as the [[electronic voting]] equipment used by MSPs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChamberSeating&quot;/&gt; Galleries above the main floor can accommodate a total of 255 members of the public, 18 guests and 34 members of the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChamberSeating&quot;/&gt;

The most notable feature of the chamber is the roof.&lt;ref name=&quot;Icon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=

The connecting nodes were fabricated by [[welder]]s for [[Economy of Scotland|Scotland's oil industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureWeek&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2005/1019/news_1-3.html |title=Scottish Parliament |publisher=Architecture Week, 2005-10-19 |accessdate=2006-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a structure enables the debating chamber to span over 30&amp;nbsp;metres (100&amp;nbsp;ft) without any supporting columns.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureWeek&quot;/&gt; In entering the chamber, MSPs pass under a stone [[lintel]]—the [[Arniston Stone]]—that was once part of the pre-1707 Parliament building, [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]]. The use of the Arniston Stone in the structure of the debating chamber symbolises the connection between the historical [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the present day Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeomarDeasbaid&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/15844.aspx |title=Parliamentary buildings: Debating Chamber |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Scottish Parliament seating.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the MSPs' seating consoles]]
Cut into the western wall of the debating chamber are laminated glass panels, of different shapes, intended to give a human dimension to the chamber. At night, light is shone through the glass panels and is projected onto the MSPs' desks to create the impression that the chamber is never unoccupied.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChamberSeating&quot;/&gt; Natural light diffuses into the chamber and is provided by &quot;glass fins&quot; which run down from light spaces in the ceiling.&lt;ref name=&quot;DesignBuild&quot;/&gt; Glimpses out of the chamber are given to the landscape and city beyond, intentionally, to visually connect the MSPs to Scotland. The necessities of a modern parliament, banks of light, cameras, electronic voting and the MSPs' console have all been transformed into works of craft and art, displaying the sweeping curves and leaf motifs that inform the rest of the building. Such is the level of craftsmanship, a result of the union of Miralles' inventive designs, superb detailing by RMJM and excellent craftsmanship in execution, that Jencks was prompted to state that the [Parliament] is &quot;an [[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]] building, designed with high-tech flair. You really have to go back to the Houses of Parliament in London to get interior design of such a high creative level—in fact, it is more creative&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunday herald&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12402641.Holyrood_is__apos_without_parallel_apos__in_100_years_of_architecture_Leading_academic_praises_parliament_as__apos_tour_de_force_apos_/| title=Holyrood is 'without parallel' in 100 years of architecture |first=Senay |last=Boztas |date=23 January 2005 |publisher=Sunday Herald |accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2006, a beam in the roof of the debating chamber swung loose from its hinges during a debate, resulting in the evacuation of the debating chamber and the suspension of parliamentary business.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roof&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Holyrood Business halted by beam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4766552.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2 March 2006 |accessdate=27 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament moved to other premises while the whole roof structure was inspected and remedial works were carried out. The structural engineers, [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]], stated that the problem with the collapsed beam was entirely due to the failure of one bolt and the absence of another. There was no design fault.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolt&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Hamish| last=MacDonell |title=Roof fiasco caused by poor work |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/roof-fiasco-caused-by-poor-work-1-486525 |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=18 March 2006 |accessdate=15 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineers concluded, in a report to MSPs, that the damage is likely to have been done during construction work on the chamber roof, in the latter phases of the project.  The report also indicated that whilst one of the bolts was missing, the other was broken and had damaged threads commensurate with being overtightened or jammed, which twisted the head off, or came close to doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bolt2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Beam shuts chamber for two months |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4818062.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=17 March 2006 |accessdate=18 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Garden Lobby ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GardenLobby.jpg|right|thumbnail|220px|The Garden Lobby of the Scottish Parliament is an open social space noted for its distinctive leaf-shaped rooflights.]] --&gt;

=== MSP building ===
[[File:ScottishParliament.jpg|left|thumb|The distinctive windows of the MSP building inspired by [[Henry Raeburn]]'s iconic painting—[[The Skating Minister]]]]

The MSP building is connected to the Tower Buildings by way of the Garden Lobby and stands at the western end of the parliamentary complex, adjoining Reid's Close. The block contains offices for each MSP and two members of staff, fitted out with custom-designed furniture. The building is between four and six storeys in height, and is clad in granite. MSPs occupy 108 of the total 114 rooms in the building.  Each office is divided into two parts—one for the MSP, with a floor space of 15&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;metres (160&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft) and another part for their staff, which has a floor space of 12&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;metres (130&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSPBlock&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/15920.aspx |title=Parliamentary buildings: MSP Building |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most distinctive feature of the MSP block are the unusual windows which project out from the building onto the western elevation of the parliamentary complex, inspired by a combination of the repeated leaf motif and the traditional Scottish [[stepped gable]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jencks&quot;/&gt; In each office, these bay windows have a seat and shelving and are intended as &quot;contemplation spaces&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeopardMagazine&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.leopardmag.co.uk/feats/28/building-our-parliament |title=Building Our Parliament |first=Ron |last=Gauld |work=Leopard Magazine |date=December 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205221508/http://www.leopardmag.co.uk/feats/28/building-our-parliament |archivedate=5 February 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed from stainless steel and framed in oak, with oak lattices covering the glass, the windows are designed to provide MSPs with privacy and shade from the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSPBlock&quot;/&gt; Criticism has been levelled at the design of the windows by some MSPs who claim that the design blocks out natural light from their offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingWindows&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/holyrood-windows-put-msps-in-dark-1-921074 |title=Holyrood windows 'put MSPs in dark' |date=28 January 2004 |first=Ian |last=Swanson |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=The Scotsman |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To remove the uniformity from the western side of the building, the windows jut out at different widths and angles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jencks&quot;/&gt; At its north end, the building is six storeys high (ground floor plus five) stepping down to four storeys (ground floor plus three) at the south end.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSPBlock&quot;/&gt;

Originally dating from 1667, [[Queensberry House]] is an example of a seventeenth century Edinburgh [[townhouse]] and contrasts with the modern [[architecture]] of the rest of the parliamentary complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt; From c.1800, Queensberry House has been used as a hospital, army barracks, a refuge and a geriatric hospital.  In 1996, the geriatric hospital closed and the building was incorporated into the Scottish and Newcastle brewery, who owned the surrounding site. The building has been extensively refurbished, and returned to its original height of three storeys to provide facilities for the [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|Presiding Officer]], Deputy Presiding Officers, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Parliament and various parliamentary support staff.

=== Artwork and features ===
[[File:CanongateQuote.JPG|thumb|The Canongate Wall façade of the parliamentary complex has quotations inscribed onto pieces of rock.]]
[[File:Canongate Wall.jpg|thumb|right|Canongate Wall]]
The Scottish Parliament holds a wide variety of artwork and sculpture ranging from specially commissioned pieces to official gifts from overseas parliamentary delegations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artwork&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/15456.aspx |title=Visiting the Parliament: Art Collection |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of including artwork and sculptures in the building reinforces the desire of Miralles that the project should reflect the nature of Scotland, particularly its land and people.  In order to facilitate the incorporation of art into the building, a consultative steering group was established by the [[Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body]] (SPCB) under the chairmanship of [[Jamie Stone (politician)|Jamie Stone MSP]] with the remit of deciding which artworks should be chosen. Some pieces of artwork are on public display in the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artwork2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/15468.aspx |title=Art Collection: Artworks on Public Display |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!---ADD CANONGATE ARTWORK DESCRIPTION WITH EMBT REFERENCE---&gt;
As well as artwork and sculptures, quotations, furniture and photography have been commissioned as part of the art strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artwork2&quot;/&gt; A range of quotations have been inscribed onto the stonework in and around the parliamentary complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quotes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/21013.aspx |title=Parliamentary buildings: Canongate buildings: Canongate Wall quotations |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath the Canongate Building façade is the Canongate Wall, constructed from a variety of indigenous Scottish rocks such as [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian gneiss]], [[Torridonian sandstone]] and [[Easdale]] [[slate]]. The stones are set into large concrete casts, each one inscribed with a quotation. The Canongate Wall contains a total of 24 quotations.&lt;ref name=&quot;CanongateWall&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/21012.aspx |title=Parliamentary buildings: Canongate buildings: Canongate Wall |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etched along the lower stretch of the wall is a pictorial representation of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] of Edinburgh-based around a sketch by Enric Miralles showing the view of the Old Town from his bedroom window in the [[Balmoral Hotel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CanongateWall&quot;/&gt;

The Main Hall of the Parliament contains a number of distinctive features and sculptures, including the gold-plated ''Honours of Scotland'' sculpture. Presented by the Queen upon the opening of the Parliament building, the sculpture is modelled on the actual [[Honours of Scotland]], the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], [[sceptre]] and the [[sword]] of the state, and combines these three separate elements into one composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honours&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/24516.aspx |title=Graham Stewart, Three Honours of Scotland, 2004 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During meetings of the original Parliament of Scotland, the actual Honours were always present but since 1819 they have been permanently housed in [[Edinburgh Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3695320.stm |title=Honours regalia sculpture shines |work=BBC News |date=9 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 11&amp;nbsp;m (36&amp;nbsp;ft) long Visitor Information Desk also stands in the Main Hall.  Commissioned by the art strategy group, the desk combines a unique design constructed from oak and sycamore and functions as a workstation for six members of parliamentary staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main Hall&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Desk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/24653.aspx |title=David Colwell, Visitor Information Desk, 2002 - 2003 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a cost of £88,000 the desk has been criticised by some over its price and functionality.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeskCriticism&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Swanson |title=£88k Holyrood desk 'failing' |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/163-88k-holyrood-desk-failing-1-1182972 |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=Scotsman |date=21 October 2006 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature gifted to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen, following its inauguration in July 1999, is the parliamentary [[Ceremonial mace|mace]]. The mace is housed in a glass case in the debating chamber and has a formal, ceremonial role during meetings of the Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mace&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-99/pa0029.htm |title=Parliament Mace to go on display at the Museum of Scotland |publisher=Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe), 1999-07-15 |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125115221/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-99/pa0029.htm |archivedate=25 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mace sits in front of the Presiding Officers' desk and is made from silver and inlaid with gold [[Gold panning|panned]] from [[Scottish rivers]] and inscribed with the words: ''Wisdom'', ''Compassion'', ''Justice'' and ''Integrity''. The words - ''There shall be a Scottish Parliament'' (which are the first words of the [[Scotland Act 1998]]), are inscribed around the head of the mace.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChamberSeating&quot;/&gt; At the beginning of each session in the chamber, the case is removed to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.

== Critical response ==
[[File:Scottish Parliament Committee Rooms.jpg|upright|thumb|The Committee Rooms of the Scottish Parliament reflect the unique architectural style of Miralles, which has won much critical acclaim.]]

As well as cost, criticisms of the building stem primarily from the [[Modernist architecture|modernist]] and abstract architecture, the quality of the building work and the location of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worsley&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Giles |last=Worsley |authorlink=Giles Worsley  |title=Talking turkey |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/08/04/bascott04.xml |work=Daily Telegraph |date=2004-08-04 |accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mixed public reaction contrasts sharply with the response from architectural critics. Its rampant complexity, iconography and layering of meaning and metaphor are widely regarded as producing a building which is &quot;quite a meal&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jencks&quot;/&gt; This prompted Catherine Slessor, writing in the ''[[Architectural Review]]'', to describe it as &quot;A Celtic-Spanish cocktail to blow both minds and budgets, it doesn't play safe, energetically mining a new seam of National Romanticism refined and reinterpreted for the twenty-first century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchitectureReview&quot;/&gt; Jencks attempted to dampen criticism of the [[cost overruns]] by questioning how 'value for money' might be judged. For him, the building is not just a functional or economic enterprise, it is an exploration of [[Scottish national identity|national identity]] and in comparing it to other comparable assemblies, not least the [[Palace of Westminster]], he argues the cost is comparable. The conception of the building has been singled out for praise, particularly in the way it re-establishes Scotland's traditional focus towards [[mainland Europe]] and its values by means of the layout of the non-adversarial debating chamber and the creation of the public spaces in front of the building, &quot;where people can meet and express themselves as a force&quot;. In an era of the [[Bilbao effect]] and the iconic building, Jencks is impressed that rather than being a monumental building, as is usual for capital landmarks, the building creates a complex union of nature and culture that nestles itself into the landscape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jencks&quot;/&gt;

The building has also won a number of awards, including an award at the VIII Biennial of Spanish Architecture, the [[Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland#RIAS Award for Architecture|RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture]], and the 2005 [[Stirling Prize]], the UK's most prestigious architecture award.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stirling&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/awards/stirling_prize.htm |title=Scottish Parliament Building wins Stirling Prize |publisher=e-architect, 2005-10-16 |accessdate=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the Scottish Parliament Building on the shortlist for the Stirling Prize in 2004, led the judges to describe the building as &quot;a statement of sparkling excellence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sparkling&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Matt Weaver |title=Scottish parliament shortlisted for Stirling Prize |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,1537143,00.html |work= |publisher=The Guardian |date=2005-07-27 |accessdate=2006-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2005 the building was identified as [[Prospect 100 best modern Scottish buildings|Scotland's 4th greatest modern building]] by readers of [[Prospect (architecture magazine)|''Prospect'' magazine]]. In 2004 the satirical magazine [[Private Eye]] also conferred the building with their [[List of winners of the Sir Hugh Casson Award|Sir Hugh Casson Award]] for &quot;worst new building of the year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Private Eye 1122|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Timeline of cost increases ===
The construction of the Scottish Parliament Building has generated controversy in several respects. Rising costs and the use of public money to fund the project generated most controversy. Initial estimates for constructing a new building were projected to be between £10m and £40m in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPaper&quot;/&gt; By early 2004, the estimated final cost of the project was set at £430m, some ten times greater.&lt;ref name=&quot;finalcosts&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Holyrood price tag rises to £430m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3517225.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2004-02-24 |accessdate=2006-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
[[File:Scottish Parliament with G8 police DSC05008.JPG|thumb|The unique architecture of the Scottish Parliament was complicated by design changes and cost increases.]]

Notwithstanding the level of controversy surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial in a number of other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of [[Bovis Homes Group|Bovis]] as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPaper&quot;/&gt; In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScotsmanTimeline&quot;/&gt; Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the [[New Parliament House, Edinburgh|Royal High School]] on [[Calton Hill]], long thought to be the home of any future [[devolved]] Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holyrood Enq chap3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/SPICeResources/HolyroodInquiry.pdf | author=Peter Fraser |work=The Holyrood Inquiry: A Report by The Rt Hon Lord Fraser of Carmyllie QC |date=15 September 2004 |title=Chapter 3 - Selection of Holyrood Site |publisher=The Holyrood Inquiry |accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of the building project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party [[Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body]] (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, at a time of increasing costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPaper&quot;/&gt; Rising costs sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoyalHighSchool&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/inquiry/sp205-09.htm#6 |title=Budget Increase - Spring 1999 |author=Peter Fraser |publisher=The Holyrood Inquiry, Sep 2004 |accessdate=2006-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103111235/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/inquiry/sp205-09.htm |archivedate=3 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the cost increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project,&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPaper&quot;/&gt; the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuildingVote&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or011010.htm |title=Scottish Parliament Official Report 17 June 1999 |accessdate=2006-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517014116/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or011010.htm |archivedate=17 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1999, the architect informed the project group that the Parliament would need to be further increased in size by 4,000&amp;nbsp;square&amp;nbsp;metres (43,000&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPaper&quot;/&gt; Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by the architect John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencely&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Report says 'Holyrood site stays' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/695252.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2000-03-30 |accessdate=2006-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencely&quot;/&gt; Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpencelyMSPs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-00/or051302.htm#Col1290 |title=Scottish Parliament Official Report - 5 April 2000 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517013516/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-00/or051302.htm |archivedate=17 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was also complicated by the deaths of Miralles in July 2000, of Dewar the following October and the existence of a multi-headed client consisting of the SPCB, the Presiding Officer and an architectural advisor. The client took over the running of the project from the Scottish Executive (formerly the Scottish Office) while it was already under construction. Subsequently, the events of [[9/11]] led to further design changes, especially with regard to security, which again resulted in rising costs. However, it was later rejected that the re-designs required to incorporate greater security into the building structure were the &quot;single biggest&quot; factor affecting the increased costs of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPaper&quot;/&gt;

By March 2004 the cost had reached the sum of £430m (compared to an original budget of £55m in July 1998 when the architects were appointed).&lt;ref name=&quot;ResearchPaper&quot;/&gt; This equates to £85 for each of the 5.1 million people in Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Population&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/press/2006-news/scotlands-population-rises-for-third-year-in-a-row.html |title=Population up for a third year |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland, 2006-04-27 |accessdate=2006-12-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061208100150/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/press/2006-news/scotlands-population-rises-for-third-year-in-a-row.html |archivedate = 8 December 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report published by the [[Auditor General for Scotland]] in July 2004 specifically identified elements that contributed to both increasing costs and the delay in completing the project.

== Fraser Inquiry ==

In May 2003 the First Minister, [[Jack McConnell]], announced a major [[public inquiry]] into the handling of the building project. The inquiry (known as the Holyrood Inquiry, or the Fraser Inquiry) was headed by [[Peter Fraser, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie|Lord Fraser of Carmyllie]] and held at the [[Scottish Land Court]] in Edinburgh. The inquiry took evidence from architects, civil servants, politicians and the building companies. Evidence was taken over the course of 49 hearings and the final report ran to 300 pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;FraserSpeech&quot;/&gt;

=== Criticisms ===
Presenting his report in September 2004, Lord Fraser told how he was &quot;astonished&quot; that year after year the ministers who were in charge were kept so much in the dark over the increases in cost estimates. He also stated that a Parliament building of sufficient scale could never have been built for less than £50m, and was &quot;amazed&quot; that the belief that it could be was perpetuated for so long. He believed that from at least April 2000, when MSPs commissioned the Spencely Report to decide whether the building should continue, it should have been realised that the building was bound to cost in excess of £200m. Furthermore, £150m of the final cost was wasted as a result of design delays, over-optimistic programming and uncertain authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;FraserSpeech&quot;/&gt;

Despite having only an outline design, the designers RMJM/EMBT (Scotland) Ltd stated without foundation that the building could be completed within a £50m budget.  Nevertheless, these estimates were believed by officials. The two architectural practices in the RMJM and EMBT joint venture operated dysfunctionally and failed to communicate effectively with each other and the project manager.  The death of Miralles also gave rise to a substantial period of disharmony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conclusions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holyroodinquiry.org/FINAL_report/conclusions.pdf |format=PDF |author=Peter Fraser |title=Conclusions and Recommendations (PDF) |publisher=Holyrood Inquiry |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brief emphasised the importance of design and quality over cost, and was not updated despite considerable evolution of the design.&lt;ref name=&quot;FraserSpeech&quot;/&gt; Ministers were not informed of grave concerns within the Scottish Office over the cost of the project and officials failed to take the advice of the cost consultants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conclusions&quot;/&gt;

The Scottish Office decided to procure the construction work under a &quot;[[construction management contract]]&quot;, rather than under a [[Private Finance Initiative]], in order to speed construction, but without properly evaluating the financial risks of doing so, and - in a decision that Fraser stated &quot;beggars belief&quot; - without asking Ministers to approve it.&lt;ref name=&quot;FraserSpeech&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conclusions&quot;/&gt; This was one of the two most flawed decisions which the report singled out,&lt;ref name=&quot;FraserSpeech&quot;/&gt; the other was the insistence on a rigid programme. Officials decided that rapid delivery of the new building was to be the priority, but that quality should be maintained. It was therefore inevitable that the cost would suffer. The client was obsessed with early completion and failed to understand the impact on cost and the completion date if high-quality work and a complex building were required.  In attempting to achieve early completion, the management contractor produced optimistic programmes, to which the architects were unwise to commit. The main causes of the slippage were delays in designing a challenging project that was to be delivered against a tight timetable using an unusual [[procurement]] route.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conclusions&quot;/&gt;

The inquiry was widely seen as clearing Donald Dewar for the initial mishandling of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dewarblame&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Stephanie Todd |title=Fraser lays final Holyrood stone |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3659940.stm |work=BBC Scotland news |publisher=BBC |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after speculation suggesting that Dewar was aware that the initial costs of a new Parliament Building, circulated to the public, were too low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jason Allardyce |author2=Murdo Macleod |title=Blaming and shaming |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/blaming_and_shaming_1_1290535|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |date=2003-06-15 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dewarblame2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Hamish MacDonell |title=Dewar 'misled MPs' over Holyrood |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1377762003 |work=The Scotsman |publisher=Scotsman |date=2003-12-16 |accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his report, Lord Fraser stated &quot;there was no evidence whatsoever, that he [Dewar] deliberately or knowingly misled MSPs. He relied on cost figures given to him by senior civil servants.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conclusions&quot;/&gt; The inquiry also resisted the temptation to &quot;lay all of the blame at the door of a deceased wayward architectural genius [Miralles].....costs rose because the client wanted increases and changes or at least approved of them in one manifestation or other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conclusions&quot;/&gt;

=== Reaction and recommendations ===
In his report, Lord Fraser set out a number of recommendations stemming from the inquiry. Primarily, in terms of design selection and when using an international architect linking with a Scottish-based firm, the report advised that a full analysis of the compatibility of different working cultures and practices needs to be made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conclusions&quot;/&gt;

Lord Fraser advocated that when &quot;construction management&quot; contracts were used, civil servants or [[Local government of Scotland|local government]] officials should evaluate the risks of such a contract and set out the advantages and disadvantages of embarking upon such a route before their political superiors. Alongside that recommendation, Lord Fraser stated that independent advisors should be retained and have the ability to communicate their advice to ministers, without those views being &quot;filtered&quot; by public officials. Similarly, where civil servants are part of large project management contracts, clear guidelines of governance should be set out and be as rigorous as standards applied in the [[private sector]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Conclusions&quot;/&gt;

Following publication of the report, Jack McConnell stated that the Fraser recommendations would be fully implemented, and that fundamental reform of the civil service was already under way, with trained professionals being recruited to handle such projects.  The First Minister emphasised that he was keen to see an increase in the specialist skills of civil servants, in order for them to be able to administer projects of such magnitude in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reaction&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=McConnell in post-Fraser pledge |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3658840.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Elvidge]], the most senior civil servant in Scotland, admitted that best practice had not been followed and apologised for the way the project had been handled.  He did not rule out the possibility of taking disciplinary action against civil service staff,&lt;ref name=&quot;Elvidge&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Civil Servants in Holyrood Probe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3668396.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2004-09-18 |accessdate=2006-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although subsequent Scottish Government investigations resulted in no action being taken against individual public officials involved with the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elvidge2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |title=No disciplinary action after Holyrood Inquiry |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2004/11/25133828 |work= |publisher=Scottish Government |date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2006-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demonstrations ==

In 2015, the pro-independence group [[People's Voice (Scottish pro-independence group)|People's Voice]] established a [[IndyCamp Live|demonstration camp]] on the grounds of the Scottish parliament demanding independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sim|first1=Philip|title=Independence campaigners pitch up for Holyrood vigil|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-34987035|website=BBC.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this camp was objected to as it risked infringing on the political neutrality of the parliamentary estate and prevented others from using the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Parliament takes legal advice over Holyrood camp|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-34987035|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheriff officers have issued the campers with a notice ordering them to leave, however the campers have refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Learmonth|first1=Andrew|title=Legal notice tells indy camp to quit Holyrood by tomorrow|url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/legal-notice-tells-indy-camp-to-quit-holyrood-by-tomorrow.10987|website=thenational.scot|publisher=The National|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
