'''''The Bus Uncle''''' is a [[Cantonese]] YouTube [[viral video]] clip of a quarrel between two men aboard a [[bus services in Hong Kong|bus in Hong Kong]] on 27 April 2006. While the older man, who came to be nicknamed the Bus Uncle, scolded the man seated behind him, a nearby passenger used a camera phone to record the entire incident. The resulting six-minute video&lt;ref name=&quot;original-youtube&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The older man later claimed that when he was tapped on the shoulder, he was under stress from an argument with his girlfriend and was calling the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]]. However, the younger man said that he was in fact merely chatting with friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;next.atnext.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=巴士阿叔痛哭　「我想自殺」 (Bus Uncle sobs, &quot;I want to commit suicide!&quot;)|work=Next Magazine|url = http://next.atnext.com/template/next/sec_main.cfm?iss_id=847&amp;sec_id=1000853|id=Issue No. 847|date=31 May 2006|accessdate=20 April 2007|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older man turned around&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot; /&gt; and started a monologue, ranting about being unnecessarily provoked under stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNrp&quot; /&gt; The younger man, who seldom talked back, expressed a desire to end the discussion. However, the middle-aged man insisted that the matter was not settled and requested an apology from him. The younger man apologised, reluctantly shook hands, but also warned the older man regarding the use of [[mother insult]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt; This last warning resulted in more profanities from the older man.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot; /&gt; The video ends with the older man receiving a phone call.&lt;ref name=&quot;cry&quot; /&gt;

==Video==
The video was shot by a 21-year-old accountant and part-time psychology student identified as Jon Fong Wing Hang ({{zh|c=方穎恆|p=Fāng Yǐnghéng|j=fong1 wing6 hang4}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;WP&quot; /&gt; In a radio station phone-in on 25 May 2006, Fong said he recorded the incident on a mobile phone in case the abusive man became violent.

The &quot;Bus Uncle&quot; title for the video was coined by members of an Internet forum in reference to the older man in the video. In Hong Kong, it is common to [[fictive kinship|refer to an older man as &quot;Uncle&quot;]] (阿叔), hence the English translation &quot;The Bus Uncle&quot;. Lam's name appears as part of the title of the original video.&lt;ref name=&quot;original-youtube&quot;/&gt; Contrary to reports in Western media,&lt;ref name=&quot;WP&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

==Characters==
As the video became well-known, reporters located the &quot;Bus Uncle&quot; near the end of the 68X bus route. He was found to be Roger Chan Yuet Tung ({{zh|c=陳乙東|j=can4 jyut3 dung1}}), a 51-year-old restaurant worker who lives in [[Yuen Long]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cry&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;beaten&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last = Fowler | first = Geoffrey A | title = Hong Kong's &quot;Bus Uncle&quot; beaten up by three men|work=[[Channel NewsAsia]] | date = 8 June 2006|url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/eastasia/view/212671/1/.html|accessdate = 25 March 2007 }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 May 2006, 23-year-old property agent Elvis Ho Yui Hei ({{zh|c=何銳熙|j=ho4 jeoi6 hei1}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;cry&quot; /&gt; previously misidentified as &quot;Alvin&quot; or &quot;Elvin&quot;) called a talk show on [[Commercial Radio Hong Kong]] claiming to be the young man involved in the argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Collection of news articles related to the Bus Uncle|publisher=EastSouthWestNorth Zone Europa|year = 2006|url = http://zonaeuropa.com/20060524_1.htm|accessdate = 7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chan lives by himself, with rare contact with his family, though he has a girlfriend in Mong Kok. He has been unemployed for more than ten years, living off welfare payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bus Uncle interview on Next Magazine|url=http://zonaeuropa.com/20060531_1.htm|author=Next Magazine|publisher=Zonaeuropa|date=31 May 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his identity was revealed, Chan was criticised for reportedly demanding [[remuneration]] for interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Bus Uncle requires a payment of at least [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]8000 for interviews (「最少八千」 巴士阿叔受訪要收錢 兩度報名參選特首 自稱身價5000萬)|work=Ming Pao|date=1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ho often takes long bus rides home, frequently asking passengers to lower their voices so he can nap. Despite being threatened, Ho said he forgave &quot;Bus Uncle&quot; and sympathised with whatever stress the older man was suffering.&lt;ref name=SCMP1/&gt; He said his patience throughout the ordeal was inspired by [[t'ai chi ch'uan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Bus Uncle D.JPG|thumb|Elvis Ho expels Roger Chan and the press, rejecting the press-arranged meeting and demanding all reporters to hand over their [[business cards]].|alt=man in dark shirt outside estate agents]]
''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' reported that Chan visited Ho's office on 31 May 2006 in [[Mong Kok]] to apologise for the dispute and to initiate a business proposal for the duo to hold a &quot;Bus Uncle Rave Party&quot;. Chan was quickly rejected and expelled by Ho, who expressed outrage towards the journalists who arranged the meeting and threatened legal action against the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|script-title=zh:「阿叔」何許人也!|work=Sing Tao Daily|url=http://www.singtao.com/special/unclebus/index.html|accessdate=17 April 2007|language=Chinese}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]]'' journalists interviewed Chan at his home in [[Yuen Long]], and his interview became the magazine's cover story on 1 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zonaeuropa.com/20060531_1.htm EastSouthWestNorth: The Bus Uncle Interview in ''Next Magazine''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 2006, Chan, who had been hired as a Public Relations officer in the Steak Expert restaurant chain, was physically assaulted while on duty in front of witnesses by three unidentified masked men who then fled the scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;beaten&quot;/&gt; He sustained severe injuries to his eyes and face and was admitted to the emergency department for treatment. The restaurant owner, Mr. Lee, then faced pressure from his wife and daughter to fire Chan due to magazine allegations of Chan's exploits in a [[Shenzhen]] karaoke [[hostess bar]]. Chan resigned after the owner's wife attempted to overdose on drugs, ostensibly in an effort to force the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=「扒后」林珍奇仰藥逼炒巴士阿叔 (The &quot;Steak Queen&quot; attempts suicide through drug overdose to force the dismissal of the Bus Uncle)|work=[[Wen Wei Po]]|url=http://www.wenweipo.com/news.phtml?news_id=HK0606120009&amp;loc=LU&amp;cat=583BS&amp;no_combo=1|accessdate=21 April 2007| language = Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, TVB television made a parody of the Bus Uncle video in promoting its coverage of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], featuring its sports commentator Lam Sheung Yee (林尚義), whose voice resembles Chan's, on a bus playing the role of the Bus Uncle. In the advertisement, a passenger sitting behind Lam Sheung Yee (played by Lam Man Chung) questions whether Lam Sheung Yee feels pressured for his responsibilities in the upcoming World Cup, which would be his last TV appearance before retirement. Turning around, Lam replies that there is no pressure and emphasises the issue (i.e. the viewers' demand for World Cup coverage) has been resolved. The passenger then offers to shake hands with Lam Sheung Yee, calling for a truce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, sitcoms of [[Asia Television|ATV]] and TVB imitated the video in argument scenes. In episode 67 of the TVB sitcom ''[[Welcome to the House]] (高朋滿座)'', the young bespectacled main character tried to stop a man from talking too loudly on the mobile phone in the cinema. As a result, he was harshly rebuked by the man. Once his family knew about the incident from a video uploaded on the Internet, they taught the character to be more assertive and not to allow himself to be bullied.

===Stress in Hong Kong===
Although many found the video humorous and entertaining, others warned that it hinted at a more alarming and sinister prognosis of life in [[stress (biological)|stress]]-filled Hong Kong, particularly inside buses, nicknamed &quot;flying cars of death&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt; and other overcrowded areas. Lee Sing, director of the Hong Kong Mood Disorders Centre at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that Hong Kong's high-stress working environments are spawning a city-full of &quot;Bus Uncles&quot;. Lee estimated that one of every 50 [[Hongkongers]] suffers from [[intermittent explosive disorder]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNrp&quot; /&gt; turning one into a &quot;ticking time bomb&quot; of rage and violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;explode&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Journalism professor and Internet expert Anthony Fung Ying-him also attributed the popularity of the low-resolution video of a &quot;trivial event&quot; to the emotional climate of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;explode&quot; /&gt; While other viral videos are favoured by specific [[demographics]], this one spread widely due to its universal&lt;ref name=&quot;alongfor&quot; /&gt; expression of &quot;the true feelings of ordinary people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNrp&quot; /&gt;

On the other hand, Ho Kwok Leung, an applied social science lecturer at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]], held that attention surrounding the video reflected the boring lives of Hong Kong people. With few interesting topics to discuss, they savour the pleasure of spreading information to a vast audience and the creation of [[Internet meme]]s. Furthermore, the banning of the use of some video catchphrases in certain schools made the incident more appealing. This lifestyle, according to Leung, is fertile ground for the cultivation of a &quot;video clip culture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Civic awareness concerns===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bus No Phone.jpg|thumb|right|Bus passengers are advised to lower their voices while talking on their mobile phones in Hong Kong.|alt=cartoon with comic-legend saying 'speak softly']] --&gt;
Ah Nong (阿濃, J: ''aa3 nung4'', P: ''Ā Nóng''), a popular [[writer|literary figure]] and artist in Hong Kong, believed that the incident highlighted the [[apathy]] of the common Hong Kong people. He emphasised that during the heated exchange between Chan and Ho, not a single [[bystander effect|bystander]] came to Ho's aid. He recalled an incident a few years back where he confronted a man smoking on the lower deck of a bus and was scolded for the rest of the journey. He said it was useless to complain to the bus driver who would not bother to waste his time, let alone the other passengers. Ah Nong argued that in such a society, a person can be accused of wrongdoing despite good intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=阿濃 |first=Ah Nong |title=Dispute on the Bus (車上糾紛) |work=Ta Kung Pao |url=http://www.takungpao.com/news/06/05/30/XK-572557.htm |date=30 May 2006 |language=Chinese |accessdate=8 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030459/http://www.takungpao.com/news/06/05/30/XK-572557.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was support for Ho's desire for a lower volume as well as sympathy for the stress felt by the &quot;Bus Uncle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Person of the Year&quot; /&gt; Others maintained that Chan's actions were atypical of etiquette in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot; /&gt; Apple Tse Ho Yi, minister of the Hong Kong Christian Service, carried out a survey of 506 students over the age of 12 following the incident. Of the respondents who claim they regularly encountered people speaking loudly on the phone on buses, only 47% said they would intervene by talking to the phone user or alerting the driver. Reasons for inaction include fear, apathy and inability to solve the problem. On civic awareness, the majority of the respondents did not consider chatting loudly on the phone to be wrong. Tse concluded that the current generation of Hong Kong young people have poor civic awareness, and it is natural that disputes often occur due to inconsideration.&lt;ref name=&quot;survey&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last = Benjamin|first = Wong|title = Only half of youngsters would give phone pests and earful|work=South China Morning Post

He criticised Ho as being a [[stereotype]] of present-day Hong Kong youth – speechless and too weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title = 巴士怒坑|series = 光明頂|serieslink = w:zh:光明頂|station = Commercial Radio|city = Hong Kong|airdate = 23 May 2006|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chan's placement as runner-up &quot;Person of the Year&quot; announced by [[Radio Television Hong Kong]] was seen by Michael DeGolyer of the ''[[Hong Kong Standard]]'' that it might have struck a chord with the general population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Person of the Year&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last = DeGolyer|first = Michael|title = Commentary: The power of the people|newspaper=[[Hong Kong Standard]]|date = 4 January 2007|url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=15&amp;art_id=35365&amp;sid=11578958&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070104&amp;sear_year=2007|accessdate = 23 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ng Fung Sheung, a social science lecturer of the [[City University of Hong Kong]], explained that Hong Kong people tend to chat loudly in public places. She attributed this phenomenon to the television screens found in many vehicles and trains, which broadcast programmes at high volumes. She suggested that the government should provide better civic education for the public to make them more considerate of others. When it comes to schools which banned the usage of catch phrases like &quot;I'm stressed!&quot; Ng stated that teachers must be able to distinguish whether the students really face pressure or are simply following the trend, and provide guidance if necessary.&lt;ref name = &quot;Problem&quot;/&gt;

===Criticism of media ethics===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:HK Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong newspapers have been criticised for their sensationalist techniques.|alt=3 newspapers on a desk top]] --&gt;
Some denied that any social insight could be gleaned from the video clip, arguing that the frenzy was artificially created by sensationalist newspapers in order to boost circulation and profits. Clement So York-kee, Director of the School of Journalism at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], warned that methods to uncover the incident between Chan and Ho &quot;did not seem to ... [involve the] traditional practice of news reporting.&quot;&lt;ref name=alongfor&gt;{{Cite news

|date=3 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, several media outlets offered rewards on unmasking Bus Uncle's identity. In late May 2006, a group of journalists and photographers initiated and followed Chan's second meeting with Ho. After Ho's refusal, they brought Bus Uncle to a dinner and karaoke session.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM&quot; /&gt; Although the session was widely reported, many believed it was artificially created news and unworthy of front-page attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

''Ta Kung Pao'' stated that the Bus Uncle incident tested the professionalism of the Hong Kong mass media, its editorial noting that Chan sought remuneration for interviews and made many extraordinary claims about himself which were published without verification. The editorial concluded by advising journalists not to fabricate news, but instead to emphasise the verifiability of stories and consider carefully whether an incident is newsworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Others held that the frenzy was not the product of a media conspiracy, but rather a reflection of the public's curiosity and Hong Kong's competitive consumer-driven media market.&lt;ref name=alongfor/&gt; The situation also allowed camera phone marketers to highlight the potential comedic value and draw attention away from privacy concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM&quot;&gt;{{Cite news
