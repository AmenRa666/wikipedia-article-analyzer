'''Gumbo''' is a [[stew]] that originated in southern [[Louisiana]] during the 18th century. It consists primarily of a strongly-flavored [[Stock (food)|stock]], meat or shellfish, a thickener, and what Louisianians call the [[Holy trinity (cuisine)|&quot;Holy Trinity&quot; of vegetables]], namely [[celery]], [[bell pepper]]s, and [[onions]]. Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, the vegetable [[okra]], the [[Choctaw]] spice [[filé powder]] (dried and ground [[Sassafras albidum|sassafras]] leaves), or [[roux]], the French base made of flour and fat. The dish likely derived its name from either a word from a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language for okra (''ki ngombo'') or the Choctaw word for filé (''kombo'').

Several different varieties exist.  [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] gumbo generally contains shellfish, tomatoes, and a dark roux, file, or both.  [[Cajun]] gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or fowl.  Sausage or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety.  After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added.  The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end.  If desired, filé powder is added after the pot is removed from heat.  Gumbo is traditionally served over rice.  A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked [[leaf vegetable|greens]] sometimes thickened with roux, with rice served on the side.

The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including French, Spanish, German, West African, and Choctaw. Gumbo may have been based on traditional West African or native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish [[bouillabaisse]]. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century.  The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the [[United States Senate]] cafeteria added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator [[Allen Ellender]].  The popularity of chef [[Paul Prudhomme]] in the 1980s spurred further interest in gumbo. The dish is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana.

==Etymology==
Scholars and chefs have offered various explanations for the [[etymology]] of the word &quot;gumbo&quot;. The dish was likely named after one of its two main ingredients, [[okra]] or filé. In the [[Niger-Congo languages]] spoken by many [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] from West Africa, the vegetable okra was known as ''ki ngombo'' or ''quingombo''; the word is akin to the [[Umbundu]] ''ochinggômbo'' and the [[Tshiluba]] ''chinggômbô'' &quot;okra&quot;. In the language of the native [[Choctaw]] people, filé, or ground [[sassafras]] leaves, was called ''kombo''.&lt;ref name=nobles98&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usner46/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Babcock Gove|editor-first=Philip|title=[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]|editor-link=Philip Babcock Gove|publisher=Merriam-Webster|year=1986|isbn=0-85229-503-0|page=1011|chapter=gumbo|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

}}
Gumbo is a heavily seasoned soup or stew that combines several varieties of meat or seafood with a sauce or gravy.&lt;ref name=gutierrez54/&gt; Any combination of meat or seafood can be used.&lt;ref name=gutierrez56/&gt;  Meat-based gumbo may consist of chicken, duck, squirrel, or rabbit, with oysters occasionally added. Seafood-based gumbo generally has [[shrimp]], crabmeat, and sometimes oysters.&lt;ref name=gutierrez56/&gt;  [[Andouille]] sausage is often added to both meat and seafood gumbos to provide &quot;[[piquancy]], substance, and an additional layer of flavor&quot; to the dish.&lt;ref name=bienvenue135/&gt;  With the exception of sausage and ham, beef and pork are almost never used.  Most varieties of gumbo are seasoned with onions, parsley, bell pepper, and celery.&lt;ref name=gutierrez56&gt;Gutierrez (1992), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tomatoes are sometimes used in seafood gumbo, but traditionally few other vegetables are included.&lt;ref name=gutierrez56/&gt;

===Thickeners===
[[File:Bucket of raw okra pods.jpg|thumb|left|[[Okra]] pods]]
[[File:Sassafras7.jpg|thumb|[[Sassafras albidum|Sassafras]] leaves, source of filé powder]]
Gumbo broth or gravy derives from three primary thickeners: [[okra]], [[filé powder]], and [[roux]].&lt;ref name=gutierrez56/&gt;  Traditionally, okra and filé powder are not used in the same dish, although this rule is sometimes broken.&lt;ref name=nobles107&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Roux can be used alone or in conjunction with either of the other thickeners.&lt;ref name=nobles111&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gutierrez55and56&gt;Gutierrez (1992), pp. 55&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Okra is more often used as a thickener in seafood gumbos than those with meat.&lt;ref name=gutierrez56&gt;Gutierrez (1992), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[Mucilage|mucilaginous]] vegetable is usually cooked first, and other ingredients added once the desired consistency is reached.&lt;ref name=gutierrez57/&gt; According to ''The Oxford Companion to Food'', okra-based gumbos are becoming less popular, as changing tastes have made the okra texture less palatable.&lt;ref name=davidson126/&gt;

Ground sassafras leaf, known as filé, is generally not added to the gravy until after the vegetables and meats or seafood have finished cooking and have been removed from the heat source.  If added during the boiling process, filé makes the gumbo too [[wikt:ropy|ropey]];&lt;ref name=gutierrez57/&gt; when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly stringy texture.&lt;ref name=davidson126/&gt;

Roux has become the most popular thickener,&lt;ref name=davidson126&gt;Davidson and Jain (2006), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; made from cooking together a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog lard, although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th century&lt;ref name=nobles113&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains.  A very dark roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux.&lt;ref name=nobles113&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cajun vs. Creole gumbo===
[[File:Cajun seafood gumbo.jpg|left|thumb|Cajun seafood gumbo]]
[[File:Seafood Creole Gumbo.jpg|right|thumb|Creole seafood gumbo]]
Gumbo is typically divided into two varieties. Combinations traditionally common in [[New Orleans]] and southeastern Louisiana are known as &quot;Creole&quot; after the [[Louisiana Creole people]], descendants of French and Spanish settlers, who lived in those areas. &quot;Cajun&quot; combinations were common in southwestern Louisiana, which was populated primarily by [[Cajun]]s, descendants of the French-speaking settlers expelled from [[Acadia]] (located within the modern-day Canadian provinces of [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]]) in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name=nobles107/&gt;&lt;ref name=broussard-marin&gt;{{citation|last=Broussard-Marin |first=Lydia |last2=Hynak-Hankinson |first2=Mary Therese |title=Ethnic food: the use of Cajun cuisine as a model |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |date=August 1989 |volume=89 |issue=8 |url=http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/pdf/cajun_broussard-marin.pdf |page=1117&amp;ndash;1121 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718234453/http://food.oregonstate.edu/ref/pdf/cajun_broussard-marin.pdf |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gumbo is usually identified by its dark roux,&lt;ref name=nobles111/&gt; cooked until it is a color &quot;a few shades from burning&quot;.&lt;ref name=nobles113/&gt; The roux is used with okra or filé powder.&lt;ref name=nobles111/&gt;  Seafood is popular in gumbo the closer to the water the people are, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage.&lt;ref name=nobles111/&gt;&lt;ref name=gutierrez55and56/&gt;  The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish.&lt;ref name=nobles111/&gt;  Cajun gumbo is usually topped with parsley and green onions.&lt;ref name=nobles111/&gt;

Creole gumbo most often consists of seafood, tomatoes, and a thickener.&lt;ref name=nobles107/&gt;  Before the latter half of the 20th century, celery was rarely used in Creole gumbo.&lt;ref name=nobles113/&gt;

===Gumbo z'herbes===
[[File:Zherbes.jpg|right|thumb|Gumbo z'herbes, served with filé powder and hot sauce]]
When [[Catholics]] were expected to abstain from eating meat during [[Lent]], a meatless variety of gumbo, known as gumbo z'herbes (literally &quot;gumbo with herbs&quot;), was often served. This variety combined a large number of [[Leaf vegetable|greens]] &amp;ndash; typically including [[turnip]]s, [[Brassica juncea|mustard greens]], and [[spinach]].&lt;ref name=gutierrez57&gt;Gutierrez (1992), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The greens were cooked to mush and strained through a sieve to produce a thick green liquid.  Preparation for this variety of gumbo was time-consuming, and as Lenten restrictions have relaxed, the dish has become less popular.&lt;ref name=gutierrez57/&gt;  It is very rarely served in restaurants.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobles110&quot;&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern times, ham or crabmeat is occasionally added to this type of gumbo.&lt;ref name=bienvenue135/&gt;

Gumbo z'herbes may have originated with the French, Germans, or West Africans.&lt;ref name=nobles109&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; It has similarities to the French dish potage aux herbes (&quot;soup with herbs&quot;), as well as to the African [[callaloo]].&lt;ref name=nobles109/&gt; The meatless dish also bears striking resemblance to a dish often eaten in Germany on [[Maundy Thursday]]. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.&lt;ref name=nobles110 /&gt;

==History==

===Background===
Gumbo is often used as a metaphor for the mix of cultures that exist in southern Louisiana.&lt;ref name=nobles98&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dish combines the culinary practices of French, Spanish, indigenous tribes, and Africans, as well as Italians and Germans. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people from these cultures lived together within a fairly small area with minimal mobility. This fostered an environment in which cultures could influence each other and meld to create new traditions and cuisine.&lt;ref name=&quot;brasseaux134&quot;&gt;Brasseaux (1987), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=&quot;The dish personifies the word 'Creole'; like its human counterparts, gumbo was born in the New World and took cues from the old but adapted to the new.&quot;|width=30%|align=left|source=Cynthia Lejeune Nobles&lt;ref name=nobles98/&gt;}}
The establishment of [[New Orleans]] in 1718 marked the beginning of the French colony of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=hall159&gt;Hall (1992), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; French settlers allied with various native tribes including the [[Choctaw]], [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]], and [[Cherokee]],&lt;ref name=hall19&gt;Hall (1992), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bienvenue134/&gt; from whom they learned new methods of cooking and ways to identify edible indigenous plants.&lt;ref name=hall14&gt;Hall (1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave ships began arriving in Louisiana in 1719.  The first ships carried rice and men who were experienced in its cultivation.&lt;ref name=hall10&gt;Hall (1992), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The grain adapted well to its new environment, and within a few years, rice was commonly grown along the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name=nobles100&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1721, 125 Germans settled {{convert|40|mi|km}} from New Orleans, and introduced the art of making [[sausage]].&lt;ref name=nobles101&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1746, the white population of Louisiana was estimated to be 3,200, with an estimated 4,730 black people.  Slaves outnumbered whites in most areas of Louisiana for at least the next 40 years.&lt;ref name=hall9&gt;Hall (1992), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hall278&gt;Hall (1992), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony was transferred from French to Spanish control in 1762.&lt;ref name=nobles100/&gt; The Spanish government actively recruited settlers for [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=hall266&gt;Hall (1992), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; About 2,000 people from the [[Canary Islands]] moved to the area south of New Orleans.&lt;ref name=hall277&gt;Hall (1992), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nobles104/&gt;  These settlers were primarily fishermen who soon began supplying large amounts of shrimp, crab, and oysters to the food markets in New Orleans. The Canary Islanders also brought &quot;a love for well-seasoned food&quot;,&lt;ref name=nobles102&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; including use of ground [[cayenne pepper]], a spicy hot red [[chili pepper]].&lt;ref name=nobles104&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Spanish authorities also granted permission for a large number of French-speaking [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Acadian exiles]] to relocate from northeastern North America to Louisiana.  From 1755 through 1795, almost 3,000 of these settlers, soon known as Cajuns, moved to the areas south and west of New Orleans.&lt;ref name=nobles102/&gt;  Louisiana was secretly returned to France [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|in 1800]], then [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] by the United States in 1803.  The southernmost part of territorial Louisiana, including New Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812.

By 1800, most Cajun families in Louisiana had purchased slaves.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The new laborers introduced new foods, including the African vegetable okra,&lt;ref name=brasseaux135&gt;Brasseaux (1987), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; and hot pepper plants which likely came from [[Haiti]].&lt;ref name=nobles103&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Onions and bell peppers were long part of cooking in both the Spanish and African traditions.&lt;ref name=bienvenue134/&gt;  Tomatoes were introduced to the region shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=nobles105&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
Scholars agree that gumbo originated in Louisiana in the early 18th century,&lt;ref name=nobles98/&gt; but its uncertain etymology makes it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the food.&lt;ref name=usner46&gt;Usner (2000), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although no conclusive evidence exists, cultural markers indicate several plausible scenarios.&lt;ref name=bienvenue134&gt;Bienvenue ''et al''. (2005), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one suggestion, gumbo is a reinterpretation of traditional African cooking.  West Africans used the vegetable okra as a base for many dishes, including soups, often pairing okra with meat and shrimp, with salt and pepper as seasonings. In Louisiana, the dish was modified to include ingredients introduced by other cultural groups.&lt;ref name=bienvenue134/&gt; Surviving records indicate that by 1764 African slaves in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.&lt;ref name=nobles100&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gumbo could instead be a derivation of traditional French soups, particularly the fish stew [[bouillabaisse]].&lt;ref name=gutierrez54/&gt;&lt;ref name=nobles99/&gt;  During the cold winters, Acadians generally cooked soups,&lt;ref name=brasseaux134/&gt; using whatever ingredients were readily available.&lt;ref name=nobles103/&gt; When the Acadians moved to Louisiana in the mid-18th century, they were unable to find many of their traditional ingredients, including turnips and cabbage.&lt;ref name=&quot;brasseaux134&quot;/&gt;  In this scenario, Acadian colonists substituted local ingredients for those commonly included in the original stew.  Instead of the  fish, settlers used shellfish.  The dish was later modified to include ingredients common in other cultures.&lt;ref name=gutierrez54/&gt;

Some culinary experts in the early 20th century, including [[Celestine Eustis]], maintained that gumbo was an early special occasion dish for native tribes.&lt;ref name=nobles99/&gt;  This is further implied by a late 18th-century Cajun practice.  At that time, rice was a luxury for many Cajuns.  They served gumbo over corn [[grits]], a pairing common in the stews of native tribes.  The use of corn and filé powder may imply that the dish was derived from native cuisine.&lt;ref name=nobles100/&gt;

These theories are intermixed in the local legend of the Frying Pan Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection.  According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans at the home of Governor [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville's housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo.  Langlois used okra, an ingredient which the women had previously been introduced to by their slaves.  Langlois introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine &amp;ndash; rice, shrimp, crawfish, and filé powder.&lt;ref name=nobles99&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
The first written references to gumbo appear in the early 19th century.  In 1802, [[John Sibley (doctor)|John Sibley]] described &quot;the dish they call gumbo which is made principally of the ochre into a thick kind of soop {{sic}} &amp; eat with rice, it is the food of every body for dinner and supper.&quot;&lt;ref name=nobles104q&gt;quoted in Nobles (2009), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, French governor [[Pierre Clement de Laussat]] hosted a soirée in which 24 different gumbos were prepared.  According to author Cynthia Lejeune Nobles, these two events &quot;give clues to gumbo's Spanish colonial popularity and illustrate that the dish could be both humble and refined&quot;.&lt;ref name=nobles104&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1824 cookbook, [[Mary Randolph]]'s ''The Virginia House-Wife'', was the first to include a recipe for gumbo.  Called &quot;Gumbo&amp;nbsp;– A West India Dish&quot;, the simple recipe described how to boil okra and bore little resemblance to the stew commonly known as gumbo.  The same book contained a recipe for &quot;Ochra Soup&quot; made with okra, onions, fowl, bacon, tomatoes, and lima beans thickened with flour.  Although this recipe bore similarities to gumbo, it more closely resembled the Caribbean dish [[callaloo]].&lt;ref name=nobles106&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more familiar version of the dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree.  Her ''Housekeeping in Old Virginia'' described &quot;Gumbo Filit A La Creole&quot;, a filé-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with [[allspice]], cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme.&lt;ref name=nobles106/&gt;  The 1881 cookbook ''[[What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking]]'', dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes.  &quot;Oyster Gumbo Soup&quot; used a filé base, while &quot;Ochra Gumbo&quot; and &quot;Chicken Gumbo&quot; used okra as a base.&lt;ref name=nobles106/&gt; Four years later, the cookbook ''La Cuisine Creole'' documented eight varieties of gumbo.  None used sausage, but almost all of them contained ham.&lt;ref name=nobles102&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1970s, gumbo was primarily popular on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]].  It gained a broader profile after the death of [[United States Senator]] [[Allen Ellender]]. A native of [[Terrebonne Parish, LA|Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana]], Ellender had often cooked gumbo for his colleagues, including five American presidents.  After Ellender died in 1972, the Senate directed that their cafeteria add Louisiana Creole Gumbo, made with seafood, to its menu in his honor.  The dish became more widely popular in the 1980s, when chef [[Paul Prudhomme]]'s popularity spurred interest in Creole and Cajun cooking.&lt;ref name=nobles114&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a signature dish in the Disney movie, &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;

==Preparation and serving==
Gumbo is cooked for a minimum of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned beforehand and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot.  Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce.  When these have turned to mush (more commonly called ''cooked down''), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water and/or [[Stock (food)|stock]], then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached.&lt;ref name=gutierrez57/&gt; Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, [[bay leaf|bay leaves]], [[thyme]], [[hot sauce]], and salt, are added to taste.&lt;ref name=broussard-marin/&gt;  According to Nobles, &quot;proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art&quot;.&lt;ref name=nobles103&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot until the end of the process.  As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, filé powder is added last.&lt;ref name=gutierrez57/&gt;

Creole and Cajun gumbos are served over hot rice,&lt;ref name=&quot;bienvenue134&quot;/&gt; which helps the dish to feed a larger number of people.&lt;ref name=gutierrez56&gt;Gutierrez (1992), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gumbo z'herbes is served with rice on the side.&lt;ref name=gutierrez57/&gt; Gumbo is almost always served directly from the pot on the stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a [[tureen]] on the table.&lt;ref name=nobles112&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal,&lt;ref name=gutierrez54&gt;Gutierrez (1992), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; although many Cajun families provide a side dish of [[potato salad]].&lt;ref name=nobles111&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, gumbo is served as part of a larger menu.&lt;ref name=gutierrez54/&gt;

Soniat gives examples of the main types of creole gumbos, along with descriptions of family traditions about them.&lt;ref name=Soniat13&gt;Soniat(1980), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspects==
In ''Cajun Foodways'', C. Paige Gutierrez describes gumbo as &quot;an economical dish&quot; useful for &quot;feed[ing] a large number of people with a small amount of meat or seafood&quot;.&lt;ref name=gutierrez56/&gt;  Nobles concurs that &quot;one of the hallmarks of gumbo is that, with a big enough pot, it can easily be doubled or tripled and is always a good choice to feed a crowd&quot;.&lt;ref name=nobles105/&gt;  With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal.  The dish is an efficient way to use up leftover perishable meats and seafood.&lt;ref name=gutierrez56/&gt;

Since the 19th century, gumbo has often been served at social gatherings or other special occasions in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=bienvenue135&gt;Bienvenue ''et al''. (2005), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brasseaux135/&gt;  Local [[fais do-do]] (dance parties) usually provided gumbo beginning at midnight.&lt;ref name=nobles105&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many families &quot;have a gumbo&quot;, or host a casual social gathering where friends and family chat and enjoy alcoholic beverages and gumbo.&lt;ref name=bienvenue135/&gt;

In rural [[Acadiana]] in southern Louisiana, gumbo is a central feature of [[Mardi Gras]] celebrations.  On Mardi Gras, local men wander from house to house and beg for gumbo ingredients in an event known as [[courir de Mardi Gras]].&lt;ref name=nobles105/&gt; Members of the local community then gather in a central location while the men cook the gumbo.  When it is ready, the group eats and dances until midnight, when [[Lent]] begins.&lt;ref name=nobles106&gt;Nobles (2009), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gumbo is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana.&lt;ref name=nobles98/&gt; Many southern Louisiana cooking competitions center around gumbo,&lt;ref name=bienvenue135/&gt; and it is a central feature of many local festivals.&lt;ref name=gutierrez114&gt;Gutierrez (1992), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The self-described &quot;Gumbo Capital of the World&quot;, [[Bridge City, Louisiana]], holds an annual Gumbo Festival.&lt;ref name=theriot34&gt;Theriot (2009), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival features gumbo cooked in a cast-iron pot 3&amp;nbsp;ft (0.9 m) deep and {{convert|5|ft|m}} in diameter.  More commonly, festival gumbo pots measure 2&amp;nbsp;ft (0.6 m) in depth and diameter.&lt;ref name=gutierrez114/&gt;
