'''''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''''' was published in 1965, the result of a collaboration between human rights activist [[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]] and journalist [[Alex Haley]]. Haley [[Collaborative writing|coauthored]] the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's 1965 assassination. The ''Autobiography'' is a [[Religious conversion|spiritual conversion narrative]] that outlines Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's philosophy of [[black pride]], [[black nationalism]], and [[pan-Africanism]]. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue.{{Cref|a}} He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's life.

While Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and scholars contemporary to the book's publication regarded Haley as the book's [[ghostwriter]], modern scholars tend to regard him as an essential collaborator. They say he intentionally muted his authorial voice to create the effect of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X speaking directly to readers. Haley influenced some of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's literary choices. For example, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X left the [[Nation of Islam]] during the period when he was working on the book with Haley. Rather than rewriting earlier chapters as a [[polemic]] against the Nation which Malcolm X had rejected, Haley persuaded him to favor a style of &quot;suspense and drama&quot;. According to [[Manning Marable]], &quot;Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's [[anti-Semitism]]&quot; and he rewrote material to eliminate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/pdfs/Souls.Rediscovering_Malcolms_Life.pdf |first=Manning |last=Marable |title=Rediscovering Malcolm's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History |journal=Souls |volume=7 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/10999940590910023 |page=33 |year=2005 |accessdate=February 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''Autobiography'' was published, the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reviewer described it as a &quot;brilliant, painful, important book&quot;. In 1967, historian [[John William Ward (professor)|John William Ward]] wrote that it would become a classic American autobiography. In 1998, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' as one of ten &quot;required reading&quot; nonfiction books. [[James Baldwin]] and [[Arnold Perl]] adapted the book as a film; their screenplay provided the source material for [[Spike Lee]]'s 1992 film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]]''.

==Summary==
Published posthumously, ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' is an account of the life of [[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]], born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book describes Malcolm's childhood in [[Michigan]], the death of his father under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her [[Involuntary commitment|commitment]] to a [[psychiatric hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in [[organized crime]]. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carson|1995|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book addresses his ministry with [[Elijah Muhammad]] and the [[Nation of Islam]] (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his [[hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]], which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox [[Sunni Islam]], and his travels in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=6–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was assassinated in New York's [[Audubon Ballroom]] in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist [[Alex Haley]], summarizes the last days of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the ''Autobiography's'' epilogue.&lt;ref&gt;Als, Hilton, &quot;Philosopher or Dog?&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=91}}; [[John Edgar Wideman|Wideman, John Edgar]], &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: The Art of Autobiography&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=104–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre==
The ''Autobiography'' is a [[Religious conversion|spiritual conversion narrative]] that outlines Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's philosophy of [[black pride]], [[black nationalism]], and [[pan-Africanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|pp= 250, 262–3}}; [[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D. G.]], &quot;The Riddle of the Zoot: Malcolm Little and Black Cultural Politics During World War II&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic [[Arnold Rampersad]] and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X biographer [[Michael Eric Dyson]] agree that the narrative of the ''Autobiography'' resembles the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] approach to [[Confessional writing|confessional narrative]]. Augustine's ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' and ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' both relate the early [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lives of their subjects, document deep philosophical change for spiritual reasons, and describe later disillusionment with religious groups their subjects had once revered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Rampersad|Rampersad, Arnold]], &quot;The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's ''Malcolm'' and Malcolm's Malcolm&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=122}}; {{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Haley and autobiographical scholar Albert E. Stone compare the narrative to the [[Icarus|Icarus myth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=271}}; {{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Author Paul John Eakin and writer Alex Gillespie suggest that part of the ''Autobiography's'' rhetorical power comes from &quot;the vision of a man whose swiftly unfolding career had outstripped the possibilities of the traditional autobiography he had meant to write&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, Paul John, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=152–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; thus destroying &quot;the illusion of the finished and unified personality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Alex, &quot;Autobiography and Identity&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=34, 37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to functioning as a spiritual conversion narrative, ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' also reflects generic elements from other distinctly American literary forms, from the Puritan conversion narrative of Jonathan Edwards and the secular self-analyses of Benjamin Franklin, to the African American slave narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature, Vol. 2|last = Gates, Jr.|first = Henry Louis|publisher = W.W. Norton and Co,|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-393-92370-4|location = New York|pages = 566|last2 = Smith|first2 = Valerie A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aesthetic decision on the part of Malcolm X and Haley also has profound implications for the thematic content of the work, as the progressive movement between forms that is evidenced in the text reflects the personal progression of its subject. Considering this, the editors of the ''Norton Anthology of African American Literature'' assert that, &quot;Malcolm's ''Autobiography'' takes pains to interrogate the very models through which his persona achieves gradual self-understanding...his story's inner logic defines his life as a quest for an authentic mode of being, a quest that demands a constant openness to new ideas requiring fresh kinds of expression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Norton Anthology of African American Literature|last = Gates, Jr.|first = Henry Louis|publisher = W.W. Norton and Co.|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-393-92370-4|location = New York|pages = 566|last2 = Smith|first2 = Valerie A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malcolm-x.jpg|right|thumb|upright= .85 |Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X waiting for a press conference to begin on March 26, 1964]]
Haley [[Collaborative writing|coauthored]] ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', and also performed the basic functions of a [[ghostwriter]] and biographical [[amanuensis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|pp= 24, 233, 247, 262–264}}.&lt;/ref&gt; writing, compiling, and editing&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gallen|1995|pp=243–244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Autobiography'' based on more than 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–110}}; Rampersad, &quot;The Color of His Eyes&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=119, 127–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote an article about the Nation of Islam for ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and again when Haley interviewed Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X for ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=391}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] publishing company asked Haley to write a book about the life of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. American writer and literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] writes, &quot;When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom page 12&quot;/&gt; Haley recalls, &quot;It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom page 12&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bloom|2008|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the ''Autobiography'', a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom page 12&quot;/&gt; Bloom writes, &quot;Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloom page 12&quot;/&gt;

When work on the ''Autobiography'' began in early 1963, Haley grew frustrated with Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's tendency to speak only about Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Haley reminded him that the book was supposed to be about Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, not Muhammad or the Nation of Islam, a comment which angered Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. Haley eventually shifted the focus of the interviews toward the life of his subject when he asked Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X about his mother:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=392}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, could you tell me something about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_201.html |title=The Time Has Come (1964–1966) |work=[[Eyes on the Prize|Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Movement 1954–1985]], [[American Experience]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate= March 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the ''Autobiography'', modern scholars tend to treat him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure in the composition of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Leak, Jeffery B., &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and black masculinity in process&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=52–55}}; Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=104–110, 119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X biographer [[Manning Marable]] considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=299–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marable argues that a critical analysis of the ''Autobiography'', or the full relationship between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marable 2009 310–311&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley's contribution to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss how it should be characterized.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, Robert E., &quot;Introduction&quot; in, {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=3–4}} , Gillespie, &quot;Autobiography and Identity&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp= 26–36}}; Norman, Brian, &quot;Bringing Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X to Hollywood&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010| pp=43}}; Leak, &quot;Malcolm X and black masculinity in process&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=52–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, [[psychobiography|psychobiographical]] writer [[Eugene Victor Wolfenstein]] writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-[[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] psychiatrist and spiritual confessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfenstein|1993|pp= 37–39, 285, 289–294, 297, 369}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Eakin, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=156–159}}; {{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=52–55}}; {{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, &quot;Autobiography and identity&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|pp=34–37}}; {{Harvnb|Wolfenstein|1993|pp=289–294}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haley exercised discretion over content,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|pp=305–312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; guided Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X in critical stylistic and rhetorical choices,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=23, 31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and compiled the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood 1992 103–105, 119&quot;&gt;Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–105}}; Rampersad, &quot;The Color of His Eyes&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the epilogue to the ''Autobiography'', Haley describes an agreement he made with Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, who demanded that: &quot;Nothing can be in this book's manuscript that I didn't say and nothing can be left out that I want in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMXpage394&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=394}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Haley wrote an addendum to the contract specifically referring to the book as an &quot;as told to&quot; account.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMXpage394&quot;/&gt; In the agreement, Haley gained an &quot;important concession&quot;: &quot;I asked for—and he gave—his permission that at the end of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMXpage394&quot;/&gt; These comments became the epilogue to the ''Autobiography'', which Haley wrote after the death of his subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood 1992 104&quot;&gt;Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative presentation===
In &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: The Art of Autobiography&quot;, writer and professor [[John Edgar Wideman]] examines in detail the narrative landscapes found in biography. Wideman suggests that as a writer, Haley was attempting to satisfy &quot;multiple allegiances&quot;: to his subject, to his publisher, to his &quot;editor's agenda&quot;, and to himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOOD103to105&quot;&gt;Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Haley was an important contributor to the ''Autobiography's'' popular appeal, writes Wideman.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=104–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wideman expounds upon the &quot;inevitable compromise&quot; of biographers,&lt;ref name=&quot;WOOD103to105&quot;/&gt; and argues that in order to allow readers to insert themselves into the broader socio-psychological narrative, neither coauthor's voice is as strong as it could have been.&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=106–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wideman details some of the specific pitfalls Haley encountered while coauthoring the ''Autobiography'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are serving many masters, and inevitably you are compromised. The man speaks and you listen but you do not take notes, the first compromise and perhaps betrayal. You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute for the reader your experience of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes&amp;nbsp;....&lt;ref name=&quot;WOOD103to105&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the body of the ''Autobiography'', Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is seemingly absent: &quot;Haley does so much with so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood 1992 104&quot;/&gt; Wideman argues that Haley wrote the body of the ''Autobiography'' in a manner of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's choosing and the epilogue as an extension of the biography itself, his subject having given him [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] for the chapter. Haley's voice in the body of the book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X but seemingly written by no author.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOOD103to105&quot;/&gt; The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader to feel as though the voice of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: &quot;Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=103–105, 106–108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;Two Create One: The Act of Collaboration in Recent Black Autobiography: Ossie Guffy, Nate Shaw, and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, Stone argues that Haley played an &quot;essential role&quot; in &quot;recovering the historical identity&quot; of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone also reminds the reader that collaboration is a cooperative endeavor, requiring more than Haley's prose alone can provide, &quot;convincing and coherent&quot; as it may be:&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone 1982 263&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Though a writer's skill and imagination have combined words and voice into a more or less convincing and coherent narrative, the actual writer [Haley] has no large fund of memories to draw upon: the subject's [Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X] memory and imagination are the original sources of the arranged story and have also come into play critically as the text takes final shape. Thus ''where'' material comes from, and ''what'' has been done to it are separable and of equal significance in collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|p=262}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Stone's estimation, supported by Wideman, the source of autobiographical material and the efforts made to shape them into a workable narrative are distinct, and of equal value in a critical assessment of the collaboration that produced the ''Autobiography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|1982|pp=262–263}}; Wideman, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=101–116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Haley's skills as writer have significant influence on the narrative's shape, Stone writes, they require a &quot;subject possessed of a powerful memory and imagination&quot; to produce a workable narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone 1982 263&quot;/&gt;

===Collaboration between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Haley===
The collaboration between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Haley took on many dimensions; editing, revising and composing the ''Autobiography'' was a power struggle between two men with sometimes competing ideas of the final shape for the book. Haley &quot;took pains to show how Malcolm dominated their relationship and tried to control the composition of the book&quot;, writes Rampersad.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOOD119&quot;/&gt; Rampersad also writes that Haley was aware that memory is selective and that autobiographies are &quot;almost by definition projects in fiction&quot;, and that it was his responsibility as biographer to select material based on his authorial discretion.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOOD119&quot;/&gt; The narrative shape crafted by Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X is the result of a life account &quot;distorted and diminished&quot; by the &quot;process of selection&quot;,  Rampersad suggests, yet the narrative's shape may in actuality be more revealing than the narrative itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood 1992 118–119&quot;/&gt; In the epilogue Haley describes the process used to edit the manuscript, giving specific examples of how Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X controlled the language.&lt;ref name=&quot;X 1965 414&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=414}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Haley ultimately deferred to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's specific choice of words when composing the manuscript,&lt;ref name=&quot;X 1965 414&quot;/&gt; Wideman writes, &quot;the nature of writing biography or autobiography ... means that Haley's promise to Malcolm, his intent to be a 'dispassionate chronicler', is a matter of disguising, not removing, his authorial presence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WOOD103to105&quot;/&gt; Haley played an important role in persuading Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X not to re-edit the book as a polemic against Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam at a time when Haley already had most of the material needed to complete the book, and asserted his authorial agency when the ''Autobiography's'' &quot;fractured construction&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the New Blackness&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; caused by Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's rift with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, &quot;overturned the design&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews 1992 152&quot;/&gt; of the manuscript and created a narrative crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=156–158}}; Terrill, &quot;Introduction&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|p=3}};{{Harvnb|X|Haley|1965|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Autobiography's'' epilogue, Haley describes the incident:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I sent Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X some rough chapters to read. I was appalled when they were soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, I reminded him of his previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.&lt;ref name=&quot;X 1965 414&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Alex haley US coast guard.png|left|thumb|upright=0.44 |Haley in the United States Coast Guard, 1939]]

Haley's warning to avoid &quot;telegraphing to readers&quot; and his advice about &quot;building suspense and drama&quot; demonstrate his efforts to influence the narrative's content and assert his authorial agency while ultimately deferring final discretion to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref name=&quot;X 1965 414&quot;/&gt; In the above passage Haley asserts his authorial presence, reminding his subject that as a writer he has concerns about narrative direction and focus, but presenting himself in such a way as to give no doubt that he deferred final approval to his subject.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=157–158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Eakin, &quot;Because this complex vision of his existence is clearly not that of the early sections of the ''Autobiography'', Alex Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X were forced to confront the consequences of this discontinuity in perspective for the narrative, already a year old.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, after giving the matter some thought, later accepted Haley's suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard, Angela D., &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and African American conservatism&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Terrill|2010|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Marable argues that Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was his own best revisionist, he also points out that Haley's collaborative role in shaping the ''Autobiography'' was notable. Haley influenced the narrative's direction and tone while remaining faithful to his subject's syntax and diction. Marable writes that Haley worked &quot;hundreds of sentences into paragraphs&quot;, and organized them into &quot;subject areas&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marable 2009 310–311&quot;/&gt; Author William L. Andrews writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he narrative evolved out of Haley's interviews with Malcolm, but Malcolm had read Haley's typescript, and had made interlineated notes and often stipulated substantive changes, at least in the earlier parts of the text. As the work progressed, however, according to Haley, Malcolm yielded more and more to the authority of his ghostwriter, partly because Haley never let Malcolm read the manuscript unless he was present to defend it, partly because in his last months Malcolm had less and less opportunity to reflect on the text of his life because he was so busy living it, and partly because Malcolm had eventually resigned himself to letting Haley's ideas about effective storytelling take precedence over his own desire to denounce straightaway those whom he had once revered.&lt;ref name=&quot;GREETHAM45&quot;&gt;Andrews, William L., &quot;Editing 'Minority' Texts&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Greetham|1997|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:MartinLutherKingMalcolmX-3.jpg|thumb|upright=.98 |right|Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X meeting before a press conference after the Senate debate on the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. This was the only time the two men ever met and their meeting lasted only one minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cone|1991|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Andrews suggests that Haley's role expanded because the book's subject became less available to micro-manage the manuscript, and &quot;Malcolm had eventually resigned himself&quot; to allowing &quot;Haley's ideas about effective storytelling&quot; to shape the narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;GREETHAM45&quot;/&gt;

Marable studied the ''Autobiography'' manuscript &quot;raw materials&quot; archived by Haley's biographer, Anne Romaine, and described a critical element of the collaboration, Haley's writing tactic to capture the voice of his subject accurately, a disjoint system of data mining that included notes on scrap paper, in-depth interviews, and long &quot;free style&quot; discussions. Marable writes, &quot;Malcolm also had a habit of scribbling notes to himself as he spoke.&quot; Haley would secretly &quot;pocket these sketchy notes&quot; and reassemble them in a [[sub rosa]] attempt to integrate Malcolm X's &quot;subconscious reflections&quot; into the &quot;workable narrative&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marable 2009 310–311&quot;/&gt; This is an example of Haley asserting authorial agency during the writing of the ''Autobiography'', indicating that their relationship was fraught with minor power struggles. Wideman and Rampersad agree with Marable's description of Haley's book-writing process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood 1992 103–105, 119&quot;/&gt;

The timing of the collaboration meant that Haley occupied an advantageous position to document the multiple conversion experiences of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and his challenge was to form them, however incongruent, into a cohesive workable narrative. Dyson suggests that &quot;profound personal, intellectual, and ideological changes ... led him to order events of his life to support a mythology of metamorphosis and transformation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dyson 1996 134&quot;/&gt; Marable addresses the confounding factors of the publisher and Haley's authorial influence, passages that support the argument that while Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X may have considered Haley a ghostwriter, he acted in actuality as a coauthor, at times without Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's direct knowledge or expressed consent:&lt;ref name=&quot;MARABLE312&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Marable|Aidi|2009|p=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X retained final approval of their hybrid text, he was not privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had begun well ''prior'' to his assassination.&lt;ref name=&quot;MARABLE312&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marable says the resulting text was stylistically and ideologically distinct from what Marable believes Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X would have written without Haley's influence, and it also differs from what may have actually been said in the interviews between Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref name=&quot;MARABLE312&quot;/&gt;

===Myth-making===
In ''Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', Dyson criticizes historians and biographers of the time for re-purposing the ''Autobiography'' as a transcendent narrative by a &quot;mythological&quot; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X without being critical enough of the underlying ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=3, 23, 29–31, 33–36, 46–50, 152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, because much of the available biographical studies of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X have been written by white authors, Dyson suggests their ability to &quot;interpret black experience&quot; is suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|pp=59–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', Dyson says, reflects both Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's goal of narrating his life story for public consumption and Haley's political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson writes, &quot;''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' ... has been criticized for avoiding or distorting certain facts. Indeed, the autobiography is as much a testament to Haley's ingenuity in shaping the manuscript as it is a record of Malcolm's attempt to tell his story.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dyson 1996 134&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' about him is impossible to know.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rampersad, &quot;The Color of His Eyes&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rampersad suggests that since his 1965 assassination, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X has &quot;become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rampersad, &quot;The Color of His Eyes&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Rampersad says, many admirers of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X perceive &quot;accomplished and admirable&quot; figures like [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[W. E. B. Du&amp;nbsp;Bois]] inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, &quot;while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero—his wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood 1992 118–119&quot;&gt;Rampersad, &quot;The Color of His Eyes&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|pp=118–119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.

Author Joe Wood writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he autobiography iconizes Malcolm twice, not once. Its second Malcolm—the El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz finale—is a mask with no distinct ideology, it is not particularly Islamic, not particularly nationalist, not particularly humanist. Like any well crafted icon or story, the mask is evidence of its subject's humanity, of Malcolm's strong human spirit. But both masks hide as much character as they show. The first mask served a nationalism Malcolm had rejected before the book was finished; the second is mostly empty and available.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Joe, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the New Blackness&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Wood|1992|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Eakin, a significant portion of the ''Autobiography'' involves Haley and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X shaping the fiction of the completed self.&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|pp=151–162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone writes that Haley's description of the ''Autobiography's'' composition makes clear that this fiction is &quot;especially misleading in the case of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;; both Haley and the ''Autobiography'' itself are &quot;out of phase&quot; with its subject's &quot;life and identity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews 1992 152&quot;&gt;Eakin, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Limits of Autobiography&quot;, in {{Harvnb|Andrews|1992|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson writes, &quot;[[Louis Lomax|[Louis] Lomax]] says that Malcolm became a 'lukewarm [[Racial integration|integrationist]]'.

And [[James Hal Cone|[James Hal] Cone]] asserts that he became an internationalist with a humanist bent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dyson|1996|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marable writes that Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was a &quot;committed internationalist&quot; and &quot;black nationalist&quot; at the end of his life, not an &quot;integrationist&quot;, noting, &quot;what I find in my own research is greater continuity than discontinuity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMAG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/5/21/manning_marable_on_malcolm_x_a |title=Manning Marable on 'Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: A Life of Reinvention' |last=Goodman |first=Amy |authorlink=Amy Goodman |date=May 21, 2007 |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |accessdate= March 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marable, in &quot;Rediscovering Malcolm's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History&quot;, critically analyzes the collaboration that produced the ''Autobiography''. Marable argues autobiographical &quot;memoirs&quot; are &quot;inherently biased&quot;, representing the subject as he would appear with certain facts privileged, others deliberately omitted. Autobiographical narratives self-censor, reorder event chronology, and alter names.
