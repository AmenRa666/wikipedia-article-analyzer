'''4chan''' is an [[English language|English-language]] [[imageboard]] website. Users generally post anonymously, with the most recent posts appearing above the rest. 4chan is split into various boards with their own specific content and guidelines.  Registration is not required, nor is it possible (except for staff).

Launched on October 1, 2003, its boards were originally used for posting pictures and discussing [[manga]] and [[anime]], as the site was modeled on Japanese imageboards, particularly [[Futaba Channel|2chan]]. The site quickly became popular and expanded, though much of 4chan's content still features [[otaku]], anime, and other Japanese cultural influences.

The site has been linked to Internet [[subculture]]s and activism, most notably [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], the [[Alt-right|alt-right]] and [[Project Chanology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/09/25/absolutely-everything-you-need-to-know-to-understand-4chan-the-internets-own-bogeyman/|title=Absolutely everything you need to know to understand 4chan, the Internet’s own bogeyman|accessdate=October 20, 2016|work=The Washington Post |first=Caitlin|last=Dewey|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/|title=An Establishment Conservative’s Guide To The Alt-Right|accessdate=October 20, 2016|work=Breitbart |first=Allum|last=Bokhari|date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/04/08/4chan-rude-raunchy-underbelly-internet.html|title=4Chan: The Rude, Raunchy Underbelly of the Internet|accessdate=October 20, 2016|work=[[Fox News]]|date=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4chan users have been responsible for the formation or popularization of [[Internet meme]]s such as [[lolcat]]s, [[Rickrolling]], &quot;[[Chocolate Rain]]&quot;, [[Pedobear]] and many others. The site's &quot;Random&quot; board, also known as &quot;/b/&quot;, was one of the site's first forums, and is the one that receives the most traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;mit&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://projects.csail.mit.edu/chanthropology/4chan.pdf | title=4chan and /b/: An Analysis of Anonymity and Ephemerality in a Large Online Community | publisher=Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence | work=MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lboratory | year=2011 | accessdate=February 27, 2014 | author=Bernstein, M.

[[Gawker]] once jokingly claimed that &quot;reading /b/ will melt your brain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gawker&quot; /&gt; The site's anonymous community and culture have often provoked media attention. For [[media planner]]s, this enterprise is &quot;further proof that creativity is everywhere and [[new media]] is less accessible&quot; to [[advertising agency|advertisement agencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Unattributed|title=It's all about the money, stupid, not the latest online technology|newspaper=[[Marketing Week]]|page=13|date=August 7, 2008|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8246737/It-s-all-about-the.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427073608/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8246737/It-s-all-about-the.html|archivedate=April 27, 2009|accessdate=February 4, 2009|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4chan users have been instrumental in [[pranks]] such as hijacking Internet destinations to [[Rickrolling|cause images of Rick Astley to appear in place of their content]], coordinating attacks against other websites and Internet users, and posting threats of violence in order to elicit individual and public reactions. ''[[The Guardian]]'' once summarized the 4chan community as &quot;lunatic, juvenile [...] brilliant, ridiculous and alarming.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TakingRick&quot; /&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Christopher Poole at XOXO Festival September 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Poole]], 4chan's founder, at [[XOXO Festival]] in 2012]]

The activity of 4chan takes place on [[Internet forum|message boards]] and [[imageboard]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gawker&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;what4chan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#what4chan|title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– What is 4chan?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is split into six categories: [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]], Interests, Creative, Adult (18+), Other, and Misc (18+). These provide for on-topic boards to discuss [[anime]], [[manga]], technology, sport, photography, music, [[hentai]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrents]], travel, [[physical fitness]], as well as a [[#/b/|random]] board. 4chan originally hosted discussion boards on a separate domain called &quot;world4ch&quot;, but these were later moved to the dis.4chan.org subdomain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#were|title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– What were 4channel and world4ch?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has had at least one employee, a [[programmer]] whom 4chan's founder [[Christopher Poole]] met via online ''[[Tetris]]''. All other [[Internet forum|moderators]] are volunteers.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot; /&gt; The /b/ (Random), /v/ (Video games), /a/ (Anime and Manga), and /s/ (explicit images) boards are respectively the site's first, second, third, and fourth most popular boards.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011japaninterview&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;/&gt;

4chan is one of the Internet's most trafficked imageboards, according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;swat&quot; /&gt; 4chan's [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] rank is generally around 700,&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/4chan.org|title=4chan.org&amp;nbsp;— Site Information|publisher=[[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been as high as number 56 at times.&lt;ref name=&quot;landers&quot; /&gt; It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]; as a result, its financing has often been problematic. Poole acknowledges that donations alone cannot keep the site online, so he has turned to advertising to help make ends meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/news.php?all#95|title=The long and short of it|publisher=4chan| author=moot| date=February 12, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the explicit content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who do not want to be associated with the site's content.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Grossman| first = Lev| author-link = Lev Grossman| title = The Master of Memes| newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]| place = United States | volume = 172| issue = 3| pages = 50–51| date = July 9, 2008| url = http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1821435,00.html| accessdate =July 24, 2008| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724092400/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1821435,00.html| archivedate= July 24, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, Poole signed a new deal with an advertising company; in February 2009, he was $20,000 in debt and the site was continuing to lose money.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP-17Feb09&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hesse|first=Monica|title=A Virtual Unknown; Meet 'Moot,' the Secretive Internet Celeb Who Still Lives With Mom|work=The Washington Post|pages=23–24|date=February 17, 2009|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/16/AR2009021601565.html|accessdate=April 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4chan servers were moved from Texas to California in August 2008, which upgraded the maximum bandwidth throughput of 4chan from 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;moot, August 6, 2012, [https://www.4chan.org/news?all#106 BEYOND ONE BILLION], 4chan News&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most web forums, 4chan does not have a registration system, allowing users to post [[anonymity|anonymously]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TheStar&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/living/article/257955|title=Funny how 'stupid' site is addictive|work=[[Toronto Star|The Toronto Star]]|author =Jerry Langton|date=September 22, 2007|accessdate=July 16, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622184259/http://www.thestar.com/living/article/257955| archivedate= June 22, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#postanon|title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– How do I post anonymously?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any nickname may be used when posting, even one that has been previously adopted, such as &quot;Anonymous&quot; or &quot;moot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#register|title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– Can I register a username?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In place of registration, 4chan has provided [[tripcode]]s as an optional form of authenticating a poster's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#trip|title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– How do I use a &quot;tripcode&quot;?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As making a post without filling in the &quot;Name&quot; field causes posts to be attributed to &quot;Anonymous&quot;, general understanding on 4chan holds that Anonymous is not a single person but a collective ([[Beehive symbolism|hive]]) of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#anonymous|title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– Who is &quot;Anonymous&quot;?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderators generally post without a name even when performing [[sysop]] actions. A &quot;capcode&quot; may be used to attribute the post to &quot;Anonymous ## Mod&quot;, although moderators often post without the capcode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/faq.php#capcode|title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– What is a capcode?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 interview on [[Nico Nico Douga]], Poole explained that there are approximately 20 volunteer moderators active on 4chan.&lt;ref name=2011japaninterview group=note/&gt; 4chan also has a junior moderation team, called &quot;janitors&quot;, who may delete posts or images and suggest that the normal moderation team ban a user, but who can not post with a capcode. Revealing oneself as a janitor is grounds for immediate dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/faq#whojan| title=FAQ&amp;nbsp;– What are &quot;janitors&quot;?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4chan has been the target of occasional [[Denial-of-service attack|denial of service attacks]].  For instance, on December 28, 2010, 4chan and other websites went down due to such an attack, following which Poole said on his blog, &quot;We now join the ranks of [[MasterCard]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[PayPal]], et al.—an exclusive club!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12090245|title=Web attack takes Anonymous activists offline|publisher=BBC News|date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=December 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101230083125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12090245| archivedate= December 30, 2010 &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
4chan was started in 2003 in the bedroom of Christopher Poole, a then-15-year-old student from [[New York City]] whose 4chan handle is &quot;moot&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot; /&gt; Prior to starting 4chan, Poole had been a regular participant on the [[Something Awful]] [[Internet forum|forums]].&lt;ref name=TheStar /&gt; He intended 4chan to be a place to discuss [[manga|Japanese comics]] and [[anime]], as an American counterpart to the popular Japanese [[Futaba Channel]] (&quot;2chan&quot;) imageboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;what4chan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/0502/1209632797289.html|title=Tuning into innovation outside the confines of English-speaking web|work=The Irish Times |date=May 2, 2008|author =Danny O'Brien|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the creation of 4chan, Poole encouraged users from the Something Awful subforum titled &quot;Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse&quot;, who also happened to be dissatisfied with the forum, to discuss anime on his website.&lt;ref name=forbes2015/&gt; Poole originally used the Futaba Channel to obtain anime-related images, and liked the concept of a message board where people anonymously shared images, which eventually led to his idea of creating a similar English-based website. During the creation of 4chan, he obtained the source code for the Futaba Channel website, and translated the Japanese text into English using Altavista's [[Yahoo! Babel Fish|Babelfish]] online translator.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011japaninterview&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=TechRev&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.technologyreview.com/web/25997/ | work=Technology Review | title=Radical Opacity | first=Julian | last=Dibbell | date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he first created the website, it had only two boards: &quot;/a/ – Anime/General&quot; and &quot;/b/ – Anime/Random&quot;; more boards were created over time, and /b/ was eventually renamed to simply &quot;/b/ – Random&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=2011japaninterview&gt;As explained by Poole during a live-video online interview with [[Hiroyuki Nishimura]], founder of [[2channel]], on the Japanese website [[Nico Nico Douga]] during his trip to Japan in 2011. Recording of video feed available at:
* July 27, 2011, [http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv57271090 Moot x Hiroyuki Social Media Talk Session] (ID: 57271090).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TechRev /&gt;

During the early days of 4chan, the boards that originally existed were the anime, random, cute, hentai, and [[yaoi]] boards; a [[lolicon]] board also existed at /l/,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#20 |title=News |publisher=4chan |date=August 14, 2004 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after being disabled for a week around the turn of the year 2004 it was removed in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonnydigital.com/4chan-history |title=4chan history &amp;#124; Jonathan's Reference Pages |publisher=Jonnydigital.com |date= |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The /g/ board also was initially dedicated to [[Ero guro|guro]], before it was deleted and later remade as the &quot;technology&quot; board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#11 |title=News |publisher=4chan |date=August 14, 2004 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2004, 4chan briefly went offline,&lt;ref&gt;June 20, 2004, Poole, [https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#53 DING DONG, 4CHAN IS DEAD], 4chan News&lt;/ref&gt; then returned fully online a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;August 11, 2004, &quot;The Team&quot;, [https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#55 WE'RE BACK!], 4chan News&lt;/ref&gt; Following 4chan's return, non-anime related boards, such as the weapons, automobile, and video games boards, were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/news/?all#59 |title=News |publisher=4chan |date=August 14, 2004 |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the &quot;Japan/General&quot; board at /jp/ was created for topics that did not fit under the anime and manga category of /a/; /jp/ was later renamed to &quot;Otaku Culture&quot;.

In January 2011, Poole announced the deletion of the /r9k/ (&quot;ROBOT9000&quot;) and /new/ (News) boards, saying that /new/ had become devoted to racist discussions, and /r9k/ no longer served its original purpose of being a test implementation of [[xkcd]]'s [[ROBOT9000]] script.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;January 19, 2011, [http://content.4chan.org/tmp/r9knew.txt Why were /r9k/ and /new/ removed?] – Statement by him regarding the removal of /r9k/ and /new/.

(WebCite archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, 4chan had implemented [[reCAPTCHA]] in an effort to thwart spam arising from JavaScript worms. By November 2011, 4chan made the transition to utilizing [[CloudFlare]] following a series of distributed denial of service attacks.

===Christopher Poole===
Poole kept his real-life identity hidden until it was revealed on July 9, 2008, in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

On September 12, 2009, Poole gave a talk on why 4chan has a reputation as a &quot;Meme Factory&quot; at the Paraflows Symposium in Vienna, Austria, which was part of the Paraflows 09 festival, themed [[Reality Hacking|Urban Hacking]]. In this talk, Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system, and to the lack of data retention on the site (&quot;The site has no memory.&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paraflows.at/index.php?id=131 |title=Paraflows 09, Program for Saturday, Sep 12 2009 |publisher=Paraflows.at |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herwig, Jana [http://digiom.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/moot-on-4chan-and-why-it-works-as-a-meme-factory/ Partial transcript: Moot on 4chan and why it works as a meme factory], Digiom Blog, 2010-04-06, accessed 2010-04-07&lt;!-- note – this reference includes his real name --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

4chan has been labeled as the starting point of the Anonymous meme by The ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;landers&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author =Chris Landers| title =Serious Business| work =[[Baltimore City Paper]]| date =March 2, 2008| url =http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543| accessdate =July 13, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080608050312/http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543| archivedate= June 8, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the norm of posts signed with the &quot;Anonymous&quot; moniker. The ''[[National Post]]''{{'}}s David George-Cosh said it has been &quot;widely reported&quot; that Anonymous is associated with 4chan and [[Imageboard|711chan]], as well as numerous [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/story.html?id=db57d8d2-ca06-4fe0-8a8b-4975100f7231|title=Online group declares war on Scientology|work=National Post |location=Canada |author =David George-Cosh|date=January 25, 2008|accessdate=July 13, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080603083324/http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/story.html?id=db57d8d2-ca06-4fe0-8a8b-4975100f7231| archivedate= June 3, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its association with Anonymous, 4chan has become associated with [[Project Chanology]], a worldwide protest against the [[Church of Scientology]] held by members of Anonymous. On January 15, 2008, a 4chan user posted to /b/, suggesting participants &quot;do something big&quot; against the Church of Scientology's website. This message resulted in the Church receiving threatening phone calls. It quickly grew into a large real-world protest. Unlike previous Anonymous attacks, this action was characterized by 4chan [[meme]]s including [[rickrolling|rickrolls]] and [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s. The raid drew criticism from some 4chan users who felt it would bring the site undesirable attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;landers&quot; /&gt;

==Notable imageboards==
As of January 2016, 4chan hosts 66 discussion-based imageboards, one upload-only [[Flash animation|Flash]] board, and a number of trial boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Frames - 4chan|url = https://www.4chan.org/frames|website = www.4chan.org|access-date = January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;random&quot; board, '''/b/''', follows the design of Futaba Channel's Nijiura board. It was the first board created, and is by far 4chan's most popular board, with 30% of site traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fimoculous.com/archive/post-5738.cfm | title = An Interview With The Founder of 4chan | last = Sorgatz | first = Rex | publisher = Fimoculous.com | date = February 18, 2009 | accessdate =May 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4chan.org/news.php?all#101|title=/b/|publisher=4chan|author =moot|date=July 11, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gawker.com]]'s Nick Douglas summarized /b/ as a board where &quot;people try to shock, entertain, and coax free porn from each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gawker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/346385/what-the-hell-are-4chan-ed-something-awful-and-b|title=What The Hell Are 4chan, ED, Something Awful, And &quot;b&quot;?|publisher=[[Gawker.com]]|author =Nick Douglas|date=January 18, 2008|accessdate=July 15, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724081826/http://gawker.com/346385/what-the-hell-are-4chan-ed-something-awful-and-b| archivedate= July 24, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; /b/ has a &quot;no rules&quot; policy, except for bans on certain illegal content, such as [[child pornography]], invasions of other websites (posting floods of disruptive content), and under-18 viewing, all of which are inherited from site-wide rules. The &quot;no invasions&quot; rule was added in late 2006, after /b/ users spent most of the summer &quot;invading&quot; [[Habbo]] Hotel. The &quot;no rules&quot; policy also applies to actions of administrators and moderators, which means that users may be banned at any time, for any reason, including no reason at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;4chanTOS&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.4chan.org/rules.php#b|title=4chan&amp;nbsp;— Rules&amp;nbsp;– /b/ – Random|publisher=4chan|accessdate=August 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due partially to its anonymous nature, board moderation is not always successful—indeed, the site's anti-child pornography rule is a subject of jokes on /b/.&lt;ref name=&quot;landers&quot; /&gt; Christopher Poole told ''[[The New York Times]]'', in a discussion on the moderation of /b/, that &quot;the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards&quot; and that site staff simply provided a framework.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;

Each post is assigned a post number. Certain post numbers are sought after with a large amount of posting taking place to &quot;GET&quot; them.

==Internet memes==
Many [[Internet meme]]s&amp;nbsp;–– catchphrases or images that spread quickly, [[peer-to-peer (meme)|peer to peer]], across the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2000/aug/10/technology|title=It's all in the memes|work=The Guardian |author =Karl Hodge|date=August 10, 2000|accessdate=September 13, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080814103615/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2000/aug/10/technology| archivedate= August 14, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– have originated on 4chan, usually /b/, as its fast moving, [[crowd psychology]] nature enables content to quickly be passed on to large numbers of viewers.
Other memes originating on the site have gained media attention of a lesser degree. These include &quot;So I herd u liek [[mudkip]]z&quot;{{Sic}}, which involves a phrase based on [[Pokémon]] and which generated numerous YouTube tribute videos,&lt;ref name=&quot;TheStar&quot; /&gt; and the term &quot;''an hero''&quot;{{Sic}} as a synonym for [[suicide]], after a misspelling in the [[Myspace]] [[online memorial]] of seventh grader Mitchell Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Trolls Among Us|author =MATTATHIAS SCHWARTZ|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4chan, and other websites, such as the satirical Encyclopedia Dramatica, have also contributed to the development of significant amounts of [[leet]]speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece|title=Scientology: the Anonymous protestors|work=The Times |author =Caitlin Moran|date=June 20, 2008|accessdate=August 25, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080905163346/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece| archivedate= September 5, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|Adult fans]] of ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' are also known to frequent 4chan, having had a board dedicated to their interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203707504577012141105109140.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_RIGHTTopCarousel_1# | title = Hey, Bro, That's My Little Pony!

===Lolcats===
{{Main article|Lolcat}}
[[File:Lolcat.jpg|thumb|right|A lolcat image using the &quot;I'm in ur...&quot; format|200px]]
A [[lolcat]] is an image combining a photograph of a cat with text intended to contribute humour. The text is often [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] and grammatically incorrect.  In 2005, the meme was widely popularized by 4chan in the form of &quot;Caturday&quot;. Every Saturday, users posted pictures of cats with [[image macro]]s relating to that day's theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thedp.com/index.php/article/2007/11/iz_not_cats_everywhere_online_trend_spreads_across_campus|title = Iz not cats everywhere?

===Rickrolling===
{{Main article|Rickrolling}}
In 2005, a meme known as the &quot;duckroll&quot; began, after Poole used a [[Wordfilter|word filter]] to change &quot;egg&quot; to &quot;duck&quot; across 4chan. Thus, words such as &quot;eggroll&quot; were changed to &quot;duckroll&quot;. This led to a [[bait-and-switch]] in which external links disguised as relevant to a discussion instead led to a picture of a duck on wheels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox memes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html|title=The Biggest Little Internet Hoax on Wheels Hits Mainstream|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=April 22, 2008|accessdate=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unidentified 4chan user applied the concept of the duckroll to a 2007 post relating to the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''. In March of that year, the game's [[Marketing for Grand Theft Auto IV|trailer]] had been released, and the game's immense popularity caused publisher [[Rockstar Games]]' website to [[crash (computing)|crash]]. The user posted a YouTube link that purportedly led to the trailer, but in reality directed users the music video for [[Rick Astley]]'s 1987 song &quot;[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]&quot;. Thus, the &quot;[[rickrolling|rickroll]]&quot; was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox memes&quot; /&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Astley said he found the meme &quot;bizarre and funny&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakingRick&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/19/news|title=Taking the Rick|work=The Guardian |author =Sean Michaels|date=March 19, 2008|accessdate=July 24, 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080727172939/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/19/news| archivedate= July 27, 2008 &lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox memes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/03/rick-astley-kin.html|title=Web Scout exclusive!

==Other media attention==

===&quot;This post is art&quot;===

On July 30, 2014, an anonymous user made a reply in a thread on the board /pol/ &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; of 4chan, criticizing modern art in an ironic fashion, saying

{{Quote|text=Art used to be something to cherish

Less than an hour later the post was photographed off the screen and framed by another user who posted another reply in the thread with a photo of the framed quote. Later the user, after endorsement by other anonymous users in the thread, created an auction on eBay for the framed photo which quickly rose to high prices, culminating in a price of $90,900.00.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post.

===Arrests for animal abuse===
On February 15, 2009, a user uploaded two [[YouTube]] videos that showed the physical abuse of a domestic cat named Dusty by a person calling himself &quot;Timmy.&quot; The 4chan community was able to track down the originator of the videos, a fourteen-year-old from [[Lawton, Oklahoma]], and passed his details to his local police department. As a result of this, a suspect was arrested and the cat was treated by a veterinarian and taken to a safe place.&lt;ref&gt;Danny O'Brien, &quot;Online users stick claws into torturer&quot;, Irish Times, February 20, 2009. http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0220/1224241467858.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/18170/4chan-b-goes-after-cat-abusers-wins/ |title=4chan /b/ goes after cat abusers, wins |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=February 16, 2009 |accessdate=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet attacks===

Users of 4chan and other websites &quot;raided&quot; [[Hal Turner]] by launching [[Denial of service attack|DDoS attacks]] and [[prank call]]ing his phone-in radio show during December 2006 and January 2007.

On January 21, 2014, an anonymous poster started a thread on /b/ identifying a student named Westley Sullivan who apparently went to the same high school as the poster. The original post included a link to Westley Sullivan's Facebook profile, which has since been taken down, and a screenshot of a post which said &quot;if fairview isnt closed tomorrow im going to blow it up&quot;, referring to Sullivan's high school, Fairview High School, in [[Fairview, Kentucky]]. A few anonymous individuals went to Sullivan's Facebook profile and found his address, phone number, school ID number, school schedule and teachers, and other personal information. Information like his teachers and ID number had been posted directly, and the more personal information like his address was found in the [[Exchangeable image file format|EXIF data]] of some of the pictures posted on his profile. These individuals then contacted Fairview school officials and the local police department, as well as the FBI. The next day it was learned that police had arrested Sullivan in his home and he had been charged with 2nd degree terroristic threatening, a Class D felony in Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =WSAZ News Staff |url=http://www.wsaz.com/home/headlines/Teen-Arrested-for-Threatening-to-Blow-Up-School-241452621.html |title=Teen Arrested for Threatening to Blow Up School |publisher=wsaz.com |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/Statutes/statute.aspx?id=19737|title=Terroristic threatening in the second degree|publisher=www.lrc.ky.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder in Port Orchard, Washington===

According to court documents filed on November 5, 2014, there were images posted to 4chan that appeared to be of a murder victim.

==ISP bans==

===AT&amp;T temporary ban===
On July 26, 2009, [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[DSL]] branch temporarily blocked access to the img.4chan.org domain (host of /b/ and /r9k/), which was initially believed to be an attempt at [[Internet censorship]], and met with hostility on 4chan's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/att-blocks-4chan-this-is-going-to-get-ugly/ |title=AT&amp;T Reportedly Blocks 4chan.

4chan's founder Christopher Poole responded with the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;4chan Status&quot;&gt;&lt;!--Dead link: http://status.4chan.org/index.html#2174049422947602936/ --&gt;&quot;4chan Status&quot; (July 27, 2009). Accessed July 27, 2009.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the end, this wasn't a sinister act of censorship, but rather a bit of a mistake and a poorly executed, disproportionate response on AT&amp;T's part. Whoever pulled the trigger on blackholing the site probably didn't anticipate [nor intend] the consequences of doing so.

We're glad to see this short-lived debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and Internet censorship—two very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention—so perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise.&lt;ref name=&quot;4chan Status&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Major news outlets have reported that the issue may be related to the DDoS-ing of 4chan, and that 4chan users suspected the then-owner of Swedish-based website ''Anontalk.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,534941,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Feared Hackers Call Off Attack on AT&amp;T | date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =The Bryant Park Project |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92767742 |title=When Your Pedicurist Is A Fish |publisher=NPR |date=July 22, 2008 |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from [[Verizon Wireless]] customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards.
