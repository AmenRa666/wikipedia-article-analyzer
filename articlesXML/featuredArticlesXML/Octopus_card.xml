The '''Octopus card''' is a reusable [[Contactless payment|contactless]] stored value [[smart card]] for making [[electronic money|electronic payments]] in online or offline systems in [[Hong Kong]]. Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory's [[mass transit system]], the Octopus card system is the second [[contactless smart card]] system in the world, after the Korean [[Upass]], and has since grown into a widely used payment system for all public [[transport in Hong Kong]], leading to the development of [[Oyster Card]] in [[London]].

The Octopus card has also grown to be used for payment in many retail shops in Hong Kong, from [[convenience store]]s, [[supermarket]]s, [[fast-food restaurant]]s, on-street [[parking lot|parking meter]]s, [[car park]]s, to other [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] applications such as [[filling station|service stations]] and [[vending machine]]s.

The Octopus card won the Chairman's Award of the [[World Information Technology and Services Alliance]]'s 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for, among other things, being the world's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system. According to [[Octopus Cards Limited]], operator of the Octopus card system, there are more than 20 million cards in circulation, nearly three times the population of Hong Kong. The cards are used by 95% of the population of Hong Kong aged 16 to 65, generating over 12 million daily transactions worth a total over [[HK$]]130 million.

Octopus Card Limited's and the cards' slogan is ''Making Everyday Life Easier'', which is also part of the corporation's mission statement.

== History ==
Previously, Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway ([[MTR]]) adopted a system to recirculate [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic plastic cards]] as fare tickets when it started operations in 1979. Another of the territory's railway networks, the [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]] (KCR), adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed [[Common Stored Value Ticket]]. In 1989, the Common Stored Value Ticket system was extended to [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] (KMB) buses providing a feeder service to MTR and KCR stations and to [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]], and was also extended to a limited number of non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tradelink&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradelink-ebiz.com/english/331n08or3m9a51l/newscast/ss_0412a.html |title=Our winning card |publisher=Tradelink Electronic Commerce Limited |date=January 2005 |accessdate=21 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[MTR Corporation]] eventually decided to adopt more advanced technologies, and in 1993 announced that it would move towards using contactless smartcards. To gain wider acceptance, it partnered with four other major transit companies in Hong Kong to create a joint-venture business to operate the Octopus system in 1994, then known as Creative Star Limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoldingsHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/history/en/index.jsp |title=Our History |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |accessdate=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Octopus system was launched after three years of trials on 1 September 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagofed.org/publications/economicperspectives/ep_4qtr2005_part3_clark_.pdf |title=Shopping without cash: The emergence of the e-purse |author=Carol L.

The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, which drove commuters to switch quickly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ln.edu.hk/socsp/staff/luciaindex.php#publications |title=Coercing Consensus: Unintended success of the Octopus electronic payment system |publisher=the 6th International Conference on Politics and Information Systems, Technologies and Applications (PISTA) |author=Lucia L.S. Siu |date=June 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of Hong Kong]] away from British rule, there was a belief that the older Queen's Head [[Coins of the Hong Kong dollar|coins in Hong Kong]] would rise in value, so many people hoarded these older coins and waited for their value to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc.info.gov.hk/gb/www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/ppr/press/p980218e.htm |title=Supply of new coins will continue |publisher=Hong Kong SAR Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau |date=18 February 1998 |accessdate=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/public/ar97/ch04.htm |title=Hong Kong Monetary Authority Annual Report 1997 |publisher=Hong Kong Monetary Authority |year=1997 |accessdate=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Octopus system was quickly adopted by other Creative Star joint venture partners, and KMB reported that by 2000, most bus journeys were completed using an Octopus card, with few coins used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kmb.hk/english.php?page=next&amp;file=news/service/news3q03/news2003112701.html |title=Development of KMB's Octopus Payment System |publisher=The Kowloon Motor Bus Company |accessdate=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boarding a bus in Hong Kong without using the Octopus card requires giving exact change, making it cumbersome compared to using the Octopus card. By November 1998, 4.6 million cards were issued, and this rose to 9 million by January 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siu&quot; /&gt;

In 2000, the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] granted a deposit-taking company license to the operator, removing previous restrictions that prohibited Octopus from generating more than 15 percent of its turnover from non-transit-related functions. This allowed the Octopus card to be widely adopted for non-transit-related sales transactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss48.pdf |title=Survey of electronic money developments |publisher=Bank for International Settlements |date=November 2001 |accessdate=16 April 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June 2003, the Octopus card found another application when the Hong Kong Government started to replace all its 18,000 parking meters with a new Octopus card-operated system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200306/27/0627317.htm |title=Octopus-card operated parking meters to launch on 29 June |publisher=Hong Kong SAR Government |date=27 June 2003 |accessdate=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement was completed on 21 November 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;ParkingMeter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.td.gov.hk/transport_in_hong_kong/parking/carparks/octopus_operated_parking_meters/index.htm |title=Octopus operated Parking Meter |publisher=Transport Department of the HKSAR |date=19 July 2005 |accessdate=11 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130032827/http://www.td.gov.hk/transport_in_hong_kong/parking/carparks/octopus_operated_parking_meters/index.htm |archivedate=30 November 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cantonese]] name for the Octopus card, ''Baat Daaht Tùng'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|八|達|通}}}}), translates literally as &quot;eight-arrived pass&quot; (though in Chinese it was accepted as &quot;go-everywhere pass&quot;), where ''Baat Daaht'' may translate as &quot;reaching everywhere&quot;. It was selected by the head of the MTR Corporation, the parent company of Octopus Cards Limited, in a naming competition held in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milestones&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/milestones/tc/index.jsp |title=八達通控股有限公司里程碑 (lit. ''Milestones of Octopus Holdings Limited'') |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |accessdate=28 February 2007 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number eight refers to the [[Cardinal direction|cardinal and ordinal directions]], and the [[Chengyu|four-character idiom]] ''sei tùng baat daaht'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|四|通|八|達}}}}), a common expression loosely translated as &quot;reachable in all directions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |encyclopedia=Dictionary of Chinese Idioms |url=http://dict.idioms.moe.edu.tw/pho/fyb/fyb01352.htm |title=四通八達 |publisher=Ministry of Education, R.O.C. |location=Taipei, Taiwan |accessdate=16 June 2010 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered a [[Numbers in Chinese culture#Eight|lucky number in Chinese culture]], and the phrase ''baat daaht'' can possibly be associated with the similar-sounding ''faat daaht'', which means &quot;getting wealthy&quot; ({{zh|t={{linktext|發|達}}}}) in Cantonese.

The [[English language|English]] name ''Octopus card'' was also selected from the naming competition. Coincidentally, the English name coincides with the number eight in the Chinese name, since an [[octopus]] has eight [[tentacle]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilestonesEng&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/milestones/en/index.jsp |title=Octopus Holdings Milestones |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |accessdate=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo used on the card features a [[Möbius strip]] in the shape of an [[infinity symbol]].

The slogan of Octopus Card Limited and its products (the cards) is ''Making Everyday Life Easier'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/home/en/index.html |title=Homepage |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of the mission statement of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/mission/en/index.jsp |title=Octopus Holdings Mission |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Octopus card was originally introduced for fare payment on the MTR;&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldBank&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/External/lac/lac.nsf/Sectors/Transport/D5A576A039A802C0852568B2007988AD?OpenDocument |title=Hong Kong Smart Card System |publisher=The World Bank Group |accessdate=13 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304050613/http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/External/lac/lac.nsf/Sectors/Transport/D5A576A039A802C0852568B2007988AD?OpenDocument |archivedate=4 March 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the use of the card quickly expanded to other retail businesses in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/en/index.jsp |title=Octopus Products |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The card is now commonly used in most major public transport, fast food restaurants, supermarkets, [[vending machines]], convenience stores, [[photo booth]]s,  [[parking meters]], [[Parking lot|car parks]] and many other retails business where small payments are frequently made by customers.&lt;ref name=&quot;SmartCardAlliance&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~tijo/seminar/Case_Studies_and_Profiles_Report.pdf |title=Smart Card Case Studies and Implementation Profiles |publisher=Smart Card Alliance |date=December 2003 |accessdate=22 February 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Where Can I Use It? |website=Octopus Hong Kong |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/get-your-octopus/where-can-i-use-it/en/ |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 20 million Octopus cards in circulation in 2010, the card has become very popular among Hong Kongers.&lt;ref name=&quot;statistics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/octopus-for-businesses/benefits-for-your-business/en/index.html |title=Statistics |publisher=[[Octopus Cards Limited]] |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable businesses that started accepting Octopus cards at a very early stage include [[PARKnSHOP]], [[Wellcome]], [[Watsons]], [[7-Eleven]], [[Starbucks]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Circle K]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OCTOPUS CARD |website=HONG KONG EXTRAS3 |date=16 March 2015 |url=http://www.hongkongextras.com/octopuscard.html |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 21 November 2004, all parking meters in Hong Kong were converted. They no longer accept coins and Octopus became the only form of payment accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ParkingMeter&quot; /&gt;

Octopus cards also double as access control cards in buildings and for school administrative functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;AccessControl&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SchoolCampuses&quot; /&gt; At certain office buildings, residential buildings, and schools, use of an Octopus card is required for entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://badgerherald.com/oped/2004/02/05/view_from_abroad_hon.php |title=View from abroad: Hong Kong's 'Octopus card' technology puts even credit card to shame |publisher=The Badger Herald |date=5 February 2004 |accessdate=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Payments ===
[[File:Octopus McDonalds Central.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Octopus card reader at a McDonald's restaurant in Central District, Hong Kong|Octopus card reader at a [[McDonald's]] [[restaurant]] in [[Central and Western District|Central]]]]
Making or recording a payment using the card for public transport or purchases at Octopus-enabled retailers can be done by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away. The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hong-kong-travel.org/Octopus.asp |title=Octopus |publisher=Hong Kong Travel |accessdate=11 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111155354/http://www.hong-kong-travel.org/Octopus.asp |archivedate=11 November 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cw.com.hk/computerworldhk/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=316427 |title=Scrap the coins |publisher=Computerworld Hong Kong |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=11 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929202201/http://www.cw.com.hk/computerworldhk/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=316427 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the exit point.

The MTR usually charges less for journeys made using an Octopus card instead of conventional single-journey tickets. For example, the adult fare of a single journey from [[Chai Wan Station|Chai Wan]] to [[Tung Chung Station|Tung Chung]] is HK$25.20 with an Octopus card, and HK$28 with a single journey ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/jplanner/eng/planner_index.php?spot=1&amp;start=37&amp;destin=43&amp;x=59&amp;y=18 |title=Journey Time &amp; Fare: Chai Wan to Tung Chung |publisher=MTR Corporation |accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other public transport operators also offer intermittent discounts for using Octopus cards on higher fares and round-trip transits on select routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Citybus &amp; NWFB Offer New Octopus Same Day Return Fare Discounts on Jointly-operated Cross Harbour Tunnel Routes from 1 July |publisher=New World First Bus |date=27 June 2006 |url=http://www.nwfb.com.hk/eng/news/database/news05.asp?news_id=1015&amp;yr=2006&amp;cate=A |doi= |accessdate=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited launched Octopus Rewards, a program that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20051105.jsp |title=Octopus Rewards Grand Launch |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |date=5 November 2005 |accessdate=17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rewards that the program offers are in the form of points, or ''reward dollars'', stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/works/en/index.jsp |title=How It Works |publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited |accessdate=17 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210015251/http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/works/en/index.jsp |archivedate=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At [[Wellcome]], for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWellcomeDetails.jsp |title=Wellcome |publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited |accessdate=17 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526173707/http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWellcomeDetails.jsp |archivedate=26 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Watsons]], points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWatsonsDetails.jsp |title=Watsons |publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited |accessdate=17 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080724/http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/where/en/popWatsonsDetails.jsp |archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once these ''reward dollars'' are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per ''reward dollar''. To redeem the accumulated ''reward dollars'', cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of ''reward dollars'' available, the amount difference remains stored on the card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/redeeming/en/index.jsp |title=Redeeming |publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited |accessdate=17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include [[HSBC]], [[UA Cinemas]] and Wellcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopusrewards.com.hk/earning/en/index.jsp |title=Earning |publisher=Octopus Rewards Limited |accessdate=17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balance enquiries, reloading and refunds ===
[[File:OctopusEnquiryMachine.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Octopus card enquiry machine|Octopus card enquiry machine]]
In MTR stations, enquiry machines can be found where cardholders can place their Octopus cards on the machines and the machines will display the balance along with a history of last ten usages.

Money can be credited to the card through a number of ways. &quot;Add Value Machines&quot;, located at MTR stations, can be used to top up the balance of the cards.

An Octopus card may store a maximum value of HK$1,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot; /&gt; with an On-Loan card having an initial deposit value of HK$50 and a Sold card having no initial deposit value. Negative value is incurred on a card if it is used with insufficient funds—both types of cards may carry a maximum negative value of HK$35 before value needs to be added to them again for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/type.jsp#faq1 |title=FAQ: What is the difference between On-loan Octopus and Sold Octopus? |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=22 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the maximum cost of a trip on any of the rail networks except the Airport Express and first class of the MTR East Rail line was HK$34.8, the cost of travelling between [[East Tsim Sha Tsui Station]] and [[Lo Wu Station]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MTR fare chart |work= |publisher=[[MTR Corporation]] |url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/chi/whatsnew/images/single_journey_fare_chi.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KCR East Rail fare table |publisher=Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation |url=http://www.kcr.com.hk/html/eng/services/services/east_rail/fare/images/er_fare.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701081739/http://www.kcr.com.hk/html/eng/services/services/east_rail/fare/images/er_fare.pdf |archivedate=1 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current maximum cost is HK$55.3, the cost of travelling between [[Disneyland Resort Station]] and either Lo Wu Station or [[Lok Ma Chau Station]].

The Octopus &quot;Automatic Add Value Service&quot; (AAVS) is another method by which cardholders may reload their cards. This service allows for money to be automatically deducted from a credit card and credited to an Octopus card when the value of the Octopus card is less than zero dollars. The credit card used must be one offered by one of 22 financial institutions that participate in AAVS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/easy-reloading/top-up-with-aavs/apply-for-aavs/en/index.html |title=Apply for AAVS - Octopus Hong Kong |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participating banks include [[The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|HSBC]], [[Bank of China (Hong Kong)|Bank of China]], and [[Hang Seng Bank]]. HK$150/250/500 is added to the card each time value is automatically added.

An Octopus card may be returned to any MTR Customer Service Centre for a refund of the remaining credit stored on it. A handling fee may be charged for the refund — HK$7 for an anonymous On-Loan card that had been in use for fewer than three months, and HK$10 for a ''Personalised'' On-Loan card that was issued on or after 1 November 2004. A refund is immediately provided at the time an anonymous On Loan card is returned, unless it has more than HK$500 stored on it. A ''Personalised'' On-Loan card or an anonymous On-Loan card with more than HK$500 stored on it needs to be sent back to Octopus Cards Limited for refund processing, in which case, the refund for a ''Personalised'' On-Loan card would be available in eight days, and that of an anonymous On-Loan card would be available in five days. If a damaged card is returned for refund, a HK$30 levy would be charged to the cardholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/refund.jsp |title=FAQ: Refund Procedures |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=25 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outside Hong Kong ===
Usage of the Octopus card was extended to the Chinese city of [[Shenzhen]] and [[Macau]] in 2006. In collaboration with [[China UnionPay]], Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two [[Fairwood (restaurant)|Fairwood restaurants]] in Shenzhen in August 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shenzhen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20060814.jsp |title=Octopus Joins Forces with Fairwood and China UnionPay to Introduce Octopus to Shenzhen |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |date=14 August 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, five [[Café de Coral]] locations in Shenzhen also started accepting Octopus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shenzhen 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20080131.jsp |title=Octopus joins forces with China UnionPay and Café de Coral to Expand Octopus Payment Service in Shenzhen |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer's credit card to reload an Octopus card. The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus card payments are located at [[Luohu Commercial City]] and [[Shenzhen Railway Station]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shenzhen&quot; /&gt; Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment. In Macau, the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment. Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the [[Macanese pataca]] and the Hong Kong dollar when using an Octopus card is MOP1:HKD1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macau&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20061210.jsp |title=Octopus Extends to Macau with First Acceptance of Octopus Payments at KFC |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |date=10 December 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the [[List of roads in Macau|Rua Do Campo]] and the [[Sands Macau|Sands Casino]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macau&quot; /&gt;

== Types of cards ==
There are two main types of Octopus card (''On-Loan'' and ''Sold''), and two less common types (the ''Airport Express Tourist'' and the ''MTR Airport Staff'').

===Main types of cards===

====On-Loan cards====
On-Loan cards are issued for usage in day-to-day functions, primarily for fare payment in transport systems. They are further classified into ''Child'', ''Adult'', ''Elder'', and ''Personalised'' categories, with the first three based on age and different amounts of fare concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/cardtype/en/loan.jsp |title=On-Loan Octopus |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the ''Personalised'' cards, On-Loan cards are anonymous; no personal information, bank account, or credit card details are stored on the card,&lt;ref name=knowledgebase&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rfid.idtechex.com/knowledgebase/en/casestudy.asp?freefromsection=114 |title=Hong Kong Octopus financial/transport card, China |publisher=The RFID Knowledgebase |date=19 November 2006 |accessdate=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no identification is required for the purchase of these cards. If an owner loses a card, only the stored value and the deposit of the card are lost. On-Loan Octopus cards may be purchased at all MTR stations, the KMB Customer Service Centre, [[New World First Ferry]] (NWFF) Octopus Service Centres, and the [[New World First Bus]] (NWFB) Customer Service Centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;GetOctopus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/apply/en/index.jsp |title=How to get Your Octopus |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student on-loan Octopus Card was initially issued, but was discontinued in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=已停售學生八達通 港鐵多扣錢 (lit.

====''Personalised'' cards====
The multi-coloured ''Personalised'' card is available on registration. The name and, if opted, a photo of the holder are imprinted on the cards. They can function automatically as a ''Child'', ''Adult'', or ''Elder'' card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on the card, hence accounting for different concessionary fares. As of 2003, there were 380,000 holders of ''Personalised'' Octopus cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200305/21/0521207.htm |title=LCQ4 : Octopus card has a maximum reserved value of $35 |publisher=Hong Kong SAR Government Information Centre |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card can be used as a key card for access to residential and office buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;AccessControl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/other/access/en/index.jsp |title=Access Control |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a ''Personalised'' card is lost, the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent unauthorised use of the card. A refund would then be issued to the holder of the card for the deposit and the value that remained on the card six hours after the loss is reported, minus a HK$30 card cost and a HK$20 handling fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/report/en/index.jsp |title=Lost Card Reporting |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HK Li Sing Primary School 03 Octopus.jpg|thumb|200px|Many schools in Hong Kong use the Octopus card to record student attendance.]]
A ''Personalised'' card with &quot;student status&quot; is available for students in Hong Kong. To be eligible for this card, the applicant must be a full-time Hong Kong student aged between 12 and 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTRStudent&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/whatsnew/studentoct/studoct0607_e.htm |title=Student Travel Scheme (Academic year 2006 / 2007) |publisher=MTR Corporation |accessdate=15 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311043623/http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/whatsnew/studentoct/studoct0607_e.htm |archivedate=11 March 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of ''Personalised'' card is automatically issued to a student who applies for student concessionary privileges. Additionally, they can be used for school administrative tasks such as the recording of student attendance and the management of library loans.&lt;ref name=&quot;SchoolCampuses&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/other/campuses/en/index.jsp |title=School Campuses |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sold cards====
In contrast to On-Loan cards, Sold cards are sponsored and branded cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/cardtype/en/sold.jsp |title=Sold Octopus |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are souvenir cards that are frequently released by Octopus Cards Limited. The designs for these cards usually come from fictional characters in popular culture, or they are inspired by [[Chinese culture|Chinese cultural]] events such as [[Chinese New Year]]. These cards are sold at a premium, have limited or no initial stored value, and cannot be refunded, but they can otherwise be used as ordinary cards. An example of the Sold card is the ''[[Mcmug]] and [[Mcdull]]'' collection. It was launched at the end of January 2007 to coincide with the beginning of the [[Pig (zodiac)|Year of the Pig]], it features two differently designed versions of the card and is sold for HK$138 per set. Each set comes with an ''Adult'' Octopus card, with a pouch for the card, a matching strap and a Mcmug or Mcdull ornament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20070129.jsp |title=Launch of Mcmug and Mcdull Limited Edition Octopus to Greet the Year of the Pig |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |date=29 January 2007 |accessdate=16 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Octopus Cards Limited has launched new collections of these cards for such occasions as the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], the passing of the year 2004, and the release of the movie ''[[DragonBlade: The Legend of Lang|DragonBlade]]''. Sold Octopus cards may be purchased at selected MTR stations, and all [[7-Eleven]] stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;GetOctopus&quot; /&gt;

===Special-purpose cards===
The special-purpose card, ''Airport Express Tourist Octopus'', was introduced by Octopus Cards Limited to target [[Tourism in Hong Kong|tourists in Hong Kong]]. Two versions of this card are offered, a HK$220 card with a free single ride on the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]], the [[Mass Transit Railway]] (MTR) train line that runs between the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] and the urban areas of Hong Kong, and a HK$300 card with two free single rides included. The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase. Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR and include a HK$50 refundable deposit. Usable value on these cards may be added if necessary. These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong for 14 or fewer days; users may be required to produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong. ''Airport Express Tourist Octopus'' is available for purchase at all MTR stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/tourists/en/index.jsp |title=Octopus for Tourists |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other special-purpose card, the ''MTR Airport Staff Octopus'', is available for the staff of Hong Kong International Airport and [[AsiaWorld-Expo]], a convention centre close to the airport, for commuting at a reduced fare between the airport and MTR stations via the Airport Express. Staff who apply for the card may use it for a discount of up to 64 percent for Airport Express single journey fares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr05-06/english/panels/tp/papers/tp0526cb1-1935-1e.pdf |title=Panel on Transport Meeting on 26 May 2006 Response to Questions |publisher=[[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] |accessdate=16 June 2010 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''MTR Airport Staff Octopus'' is available upon application via the company for which that a staff member works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/type.jsp#faq5 |title=FAQ: How do I apply for an MTR Airport Staff Octopus? |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative designs===

Other than the Octopus card itself, operator Octopus Cards Limited also sells watches and mobile phone covers that function as anonymous Octopus cards. The types of watches available include wrist watches, pocket watches, and watch key chains. The mobile phone covers were specifically designed for [[Nokia]] models [[Nokia 3310|3310]] and [[Nokia 3330|3330]], and iPhone 4 and 4S.&lt;ref name=OtherProd&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/other/en/index.jsp |title=Other Octopus Products |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the card itself, these products are used by waving them over a card reader. They may be reloaded with money value the same way as the card itself, including automatic reloading via the Automatic Add Value Service, with the exception that they cannot be reloaded at Add Value Machines due to their shapes.&lt;ref name=FAQOther&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/other.jsp |title=FAQ: Other Octopus Products |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Octopus watch or mobile phone cover may be stored with a maximum of HK$1,000, but do not have any initial stored value at the time of its purchase. It may have a maximum negative value of HK$35 as with an Octopus card.&lt;ref name=OtherProd /&gt; These products are not refundable for their costs, but the remaining value stored on them may be refunded if they are damaged, with the damaged product itself also returned to the customer.&lt;ref name=FAQOther /&gt;

In June 2007, a new set of limited edition products was announced, featuring Mini Octopus cards and Child Octopus Wristbands. The Mini Octopus cards, available in Adult and Elder editions, measure 4.7&amp;nbsp;cm by 3&amp;nbsp;cm (1.85&amp;nbsp;in by 1.18&amp;nbsp;in) and work as regular (anonymous) Adult and Elder, respectively, Octopus cards. The Child Octopus Wristbands are plastic wristbands with a watch-like round face and work as regular Child Octopus cards.&lt;ref name=Mini&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20070614.jsp |title=Mini Octopus |publisher=Octopus Cards Limited |accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same value-adding abilities and limitations as the aforementioned watches and mobile phone apply.

They also would cooperate with different companies. Octopus can be tailored to promotional needs with companies logo or special design. In 2008, Octopus has cooperated with Commercial Radio Hong Kong, launched a collection of &quot;903 20 Plus Octopus&quot;.

== Technology ==
[[File:Octopus reader on KMB bus.JPG|thumb|An Octopus Card reader installed on a bus operated by Kowloon Motor Bus Company]]
The Octopus system was designed by Australia-based company ERG Group (now [[Vix Technology]]). The company was selected in 1994 to lead the development of the Octopus project and was responsible for the building and installation of the components of the Octopus system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erggroup.com/projects/hongkong.htm |title=Projects: Hong Kong |publisher=ERG Group |accessdate=9 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110130259/http://www.erggroup.com/projects/hongkong.htm |archivedate=10 November 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations, maintenance and development was undertaken by Octopus Cards Limited, and in 2005, it replaced the central transaction clearing house with its own system.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoldingsHistory&quot; /&gt;

The Octopus card uses the [[Sony]] 13.56 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[FeliCa]] [[RFID|radio frequency identification]] (RFID) chip,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/374/1/1/ |title=RFID Smart Cards Gain Ground |publisher=RFID Journal |date=9 April 2003 |accessdate=8 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Hong Kong being the world's first major public transport system using this technology.&lt;ref name=sony&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.net/Products/felica/pdf/data/FeliCa_E.pdf |title=FeliCa |publisher=Sony Corporation |format=PDF |accessdate=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a &quot;touch and go&quot; system, so users need only hold the card in close proximity of the reader, and thus physical contact is not required. Data is transmitted at up to 212 kbit/s (the maximum speed for Sony FeliCa chips), compared to 9.6 kbit/s for other smart card systems like [[Mondex]] and [[Visa Cash]].&lt;ref name=sony /&gt; The card has a storage capacity of 1 [[Kilobyte|KB]] to 64 KB compared to the 125 [[byte]]s provided by traditional magnetic stripe card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/knowledge/smarttech.html |title=Smart Card Technology |publisher=Hong Kong SAR Government Information Centre |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=11 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015170810/http://www.info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/knowledge/smarttech.html |archivedate=15 October 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Octopus uses a nonstandard system for RFID instead of the more popular [[ISO/IEC 14443]] standards, since there were no standards in the nascent industry during its development in 1997. The operating range of the reader/writer is between 30 and 100&amp;nbsp;mm (1.18 and 3.94&amp;nbsp;in) depending on the type of model being used.&lt;ref name=knowledgebase /&gt;

Octopus is specifically designed so that card transactions are relayed for clearing on a [[store and forward]] basis, without any requirement for reader units to have [[Real-time computing|realtime]] round-trip communications with a central database or computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-05/bh-us-05-mahaffey.pdf |title=Passive RFID Security |author=Kevin Mahaffey |publisher=BlackHat |page=20 |date=July 2005 |accessdate=11 April 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stored data about the transaction may be transmitted by network after hours, or in the case of offline mobile readers may be retrieved by a hand held device, for example a [[Pocket PC]].

In practice, different data collection mechanisms are used by different transport operators, depending on the nature of their business. The [[MTR]] equips its stations with [[local area network]]s that connect the components that deal with Octopus cards—[[turnstile]]s, Add Value Machines, value-checking machines and customer service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's [[Kowloon Bay (MTR)|Kowloon Bay]] headquarters through a [[frame relay]] [[wide area network]], and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing.&lt;ref name=UNPAN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN007495.pdf |title=Integrated Transport and Land Use Planning as a Success Factor for Metros |author=Jack So |publisher=UNPAN |accessdate=11 April 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arrangements are in place for retailers such as [[7-Eleven]]. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system, depending on operator.&lt;ref name=UNPAN /&gt;

=== Security ===
The Octopus card uses [[encryption]] for all airborne communication and performs [[mutual authentication]] between the card and reader based on the [[ISO 9798-2]] three-pass mutual authentication protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/epfiles/FeliCaRC.pdf |title=FeliCa RC-S860 Contactless Smart Card Security Target (Public Version) |date=20 August 2002 |author=FeliCa Division, Sony Corporation |authorlink=Sony |format=PDF |page=61 |accessdate=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a [[shared secret]] access key. This means that the security of the Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drunken pilot stole Octopus machine |first=Loretta |last=Fong |author2=Parry, Simon |date=18 October 2008 |work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus card and system have never been successfully [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigchief.com/whitepapers/rfid-world-2003-05-13.pdf |title=Security and Authentication Technologies |author=Peter Winer |publisher=Big Chief Partners, Inc. |page=20 |date=13 May 2003 |accessdate=11 April 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Octopus card reader includes a [[fail-safe]] that prevents reader from initiating transaction when more than one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' reported that the fail-safe has been abused for [[fare evasion]] through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at [[Sheung Shui Station]] and [[Lo Wu Station]] were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=zh:身懷十張八達通 被揭走私記憶卡 蠱惑水客「疊卡」衝閘逃票 |author=李建人 |publisher=[[Sing Tao Daily]] |location=Hong Kong |date=12 February 2009 |page=港聞A08 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operator ==
{{Main article|Octopus Cards Limited}}
The Octopus card system is owned and operated by Octopus Cards Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Octopus Holdings Limited]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HoldingsCompany&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/company/en/index.jsp |title=Our Company |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |accessdate=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded as Creative Star Limited in 1994 to oversee the development and implementation of the Octopus card system, and was renamed as its current name of Octopus Cards Limited in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoldingsHistory&quot; /&gt; Creative Star was formed as a joint-venture company by five major transit companies in Hong Kong—[[MTR Corporation]], [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]], [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]], and [[Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry]]. In January 2001, the shares of Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry in the company was transferred to [[New World First Bus]] and [[New World First Ferry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/investrelation/2003frpt_e/F131.pdf |title=Interest in non-controlled subsidiary |page=27 |publisher=MTR Corporation |accessdate=24 April 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, together with MTR Corporation, the company was transformed from its previous non-profit making status to a profit making enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr06-07/english/sec/library/0607in08-e.pdf |title=Operation of the Octopus Card in Hong Kong |publisher=Legislative Council Secretariat |year=2007 |accessdate=25 April 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the expansion of the company's businesses, Octopus Holdings Limited was established in 2005 and Octopus Cards Limited was restructured as its subsidiary. The business of Octopus Cards Limited, being a payment business, is regulated by the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]], while Octopus' non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings Limited that are independent of Octopus Cards Limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoldingsCompany&quot; /&gt; As of 2007, Octopus Holdings Limited was a joint-venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 54.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/company/en/operators.jsp |title=The Joint Venture of Five Major Transport Operators |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |accessdate=15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Government of Hong Kong]] owns 76.54% of the MTR Corporation (as of 31 December 2005) and wholly owns the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/investrelation/shareholder_services.php |title=Investors' Information |publisher=MTR Corporation |accessdate=15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcrc.com/html/eng/corporate/about_kcrc/history/index.asp |title=History |publisher=Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation |accessdate=15 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403124553/http://www.kcrc.com/html/eng/corporate/about_kcrc/history/index.asp |archivedate=3 April 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Holdings Limited, and thus also the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Cards Limited.

Initially, Octopus Cards Limited, then known as Creative Star Limited, was restricted to having at most 15 percent of Octopus card transactions for non-transport transactions, as it operated under the Hong Kong government's ''[[Banking Ordinance]]''. On 20 April 2000, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority authorised the company for deposit-taking, which allowed for 50 percent of Octopus card transactions to be unrelated to transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr00-01/english/hc/papers/ls-1.pdf |title=Legal Service Division Reports on Subsidiary Legislation tabled in the Legislative Council from 7 June to 26 June and on 4 October 2000 |publisher=Legislative Council of the HKSAR |page=36 |date=4 October 2000 |accessdate=16 April 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; HK$416 million (US$53.3 million) is deposited in the Octopus system at any given time as of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Octopus Card in Hong Kong |publisher=China-community de |url=http://www.china-community.de/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=45 |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=15 May 2007 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In taxis ==
Although a popular form of transport, [[Taxicabs of Hong Kong|taxis in Hong Kong]] do not accept the Octopus card. On 27 June 2006, after 10 years of negotiations between Octopus Cards Limited and the taxi industry, the first trial of taxis equipped with Octopus card readers was launched in the [[New Territories]] with taxis operated by the Yellow Taxi Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20060627.jsp |title=Octopus To Be Used In Hong Kong By First Batch of Taxis |publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited |date=27 June 2006 |accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was reported on 30 October that of the 20 taxis that participated in the trial, eight had dropped out. Part of the reason was technical—drivers must return to the office every day for accounting. The Octopus card company said it would be upgrading the system to allow automatic account updating in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;TaxiSetback&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/node_10/node_37/node_83/2006/10/31/116225881510438.shtml |title=Setback for Octopus Card Trial in Taxis in HK |publisher=Life of GuangZhou |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=29 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928200619/http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/node_10/node_37/node_83/2006/10/31/116225881510438.shtml |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wong Yu-ting, managing director of the Yellow Taxi Group, also noted that they had been &quot;trying to convince restaurants and retailers&quot; to offer discounts to Octopus taxi passengers, but the [[Transport Department (Hong Kong)|Transport Department]] had been a major obstacle. The Transport Department is against this approach for legal reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;TaxiSetback&quot; /&gt;

==Awards==

The Octopus card is recognised internationally, winning the Chairman's Award of the [[World Information Technology and Services Alliance]]'s 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for being the world's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system, and for its innovative use of technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;WITSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.witsa.org/press/05-04-06_WITSA_AWARDS_rev.doc |title=WITSA Announces 2006 Global IT Excellence Award Winners |publisher=World Information Technology and Services Alliance |date=4 May 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2007 |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

=== EPS add-value glitch ===
[[File:OctopusAddValueMachine.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Octopus Card Recharging terminal with the now-terminated EPS system|Octopus Card Recharging terminal with the now-terminated EPS system]]
In February 2007 it was found that when customers added value to their cards at self-service add-value points located in MTR and Light rail stations, their bank accounts were debited even if the transactions had been cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPS1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20070204/news_20070204_56_376306.htm |title=MTR and KCR Octopus EPS Add-Value Services suspended |publisher=RTHK News |date=4 February 2007 |accessdate=27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems. Initially, two cases were reported. The company then announced that the use of the payment system, [[Electronic Payment Services]] (EPS), at add-value service points would be suspended until further notice, and that it had started an investigation into the reasons for the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPS2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gbcode.rthk.org.hk/gb/app2.rthk.org.hk/pda/news/content.php?id=379458 |title=Octopus company ordered to submit auditor's report after complaints over EPS add-value losses |publisher=RTHK News |date=17 February 2007 |accessdate=27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2007 it was announced that the faulty transactions could be traced back to 2000, and that a total of 3.7 million Hong Kong dollars had been wrongly deducted in 15,270 cases. The company reported that there might be cases dating to before 2000, but that only transactions from the past seven years were kept. The company stated that it would co-operate with EPS Company Limited, operator of Electronic Payment Services, and banks, to contact customers involved and arrange a refund within ten weeks' time.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPS3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20070727/news_20070727_56_419225.htm |title=Octopus Card company to refund customers |publisher=RTHK News |date=27 July 2007 |accessdate=27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2007 the company announced that it would permanently cease all transactions using EPS because it could not guarantee that such problems would not occur again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/expressnews/20071221/news_20071221_55_455661.htm |title=Octopus Card company ceased all EPS transactions |publisher=RTHK News |language=Chinese |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy abuse ===
On 15 July 2010, despite Octopus' claims to have never sold data, a former employee of the CIGNA insurance company claimed CIGNA purchased records for 2.4 million Octopus users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=100560&amp;sid=28905404&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100715 |title=Octopus in hot water over `sold' personal data claim |publisher=The Standard |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July, Octopus acknowledged selling customers' personal details to Cigna and CPP, and started an internal review of their data practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Standard&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&amp;art_id=100804&amp;sid=28982591&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100722&amp;fc=4 |title=Privacy chief to start Octopus data-sharing probe |publisher=The Standard |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Octopus Holdings made 44 million Hong Kong dollars ($5.7M USD) over 4.5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703292704575393041691058012.html# |title=Hong Kong's Cashless-Payment Operator Under Fire |publisher=WSJ.com |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |first=Jeffrey |last=Ng}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roderick Woo Bun, Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, gave radio interviews and called for transparent investigation, but his term expired at the end of July 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Standard&quot;/&gt; Allan Chiang Yam-wang was announced as the incoming Privacy Commissioner. This news was met with protests and international outrage, due to his prior history of privacy invasions involving cameras used to spy on his employees at the Post Office, and disclosing hundreds of job applicants' personal data to corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=101042&amp;sid=29044821&amp;con_type=1 |publisher=The Standard |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |title=Postal staff stamp on privacy chief}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outgoing Privacy Commissioner Woo pledged to finish a preliminary report on the Octopus privacy abuse before his term ends, and called for a new law making it a criminal offence for companies to sell personal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-29/hong-kong-may-outlaw-sale-of-consumers-personal-data-apple-daily-reports.html |title=Hong Kong May Outlaw Sale of Consumers' Personal Data |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |first=Stanley |last=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;
