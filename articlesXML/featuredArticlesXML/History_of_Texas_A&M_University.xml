The '''history of Texas A&amp;M University''', the first public institution of higher education in [[Texas]], began in 1871, when the [[Texas A&amp;M University|Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas]] was established as a [[land-grant university|land-grant college]] by the [[Texas Legislature]]. Classes began on October 4, 1876. Although Texas A&amp;M was originally scheduled to be established under the Texas Constitution as a branch of the yet-to-be-created [[University of Texas System|University of Texas]], subsequent acts of the Texas Legislature never gave the university any authority over Texas A&amp;M.  In 1875, the Legislature separated the administrations of A&amp;M and the University of Texas, which still existed only on paper. The Agricultural and Mechanical College formally opened on Oct. 4, 1876.

For much of its first century, enrollment at Texas A&amp;M was restricted to white men who were willing to participate in the [[Texas A&amp;M Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]] and receive [[Reserve Officer Training Corps|military training]]. During this time, a limited number of women were allowed to attend classes but forbidden from gaining a degree. During [[World War I]], 49% of A&amp;M graduates were in military service, and in 1918, the senior class was mustered into military service to fight in France. During [[World War II]], Texas A&amp;M produced over 20,000 combat troops, contributing more officers than both the [[United States Military Academy]] and [[United States Naval Academy]] combined.

Shortly after World War II, the Texas Legislature redefined Texas A&amp;M as a university and the flagship school of the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]], making official the school's status as a clear and separate institution from the University of Texas. In the 1960s, the state legislature renamed the school Texas A&amp;M University, with the &quot;A&amp;M&quot; becoming purely symbolic. Under the leadership of [[James Earl Rudder]], the school became racially integrated and coeducational. Membership in the Corps of Cadets became voluntary.

In the second half of the 20th century, the university was recognized for its research with the designations [[sea-grant university]] and [[space-grant university]]. The school was further honored in 1997 with the establishment of the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] on the western edge of the campus.

== Early years ==
[[Image:Texas A&amp;M 1883 campus.jpg|thumb|right|Texas A&amp;M in 1883]]
The [[US Congress]] laid the groundwork for the establishment of Texas A&amp;M with their proposal of the [[Morrill Act]]. The Morrill Act, signed into law July 2, 1862, was created to enable states to establish colleges where the &quot;leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts...in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life&quot;. States were granted public lands to be sold at auctions to establish a permanent fund to support the schools. Both the [[Republic of Texas]] and the [[Legislature of Texas|Texas State Legislature]] also set aside public lands for a future college.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Texas A.M.C., was established by the state legislature on April 17, 1871 as the state's first public institution of higher education.&lt;ref name=&quot;txconstitution&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Texas Constitution, Article 7 - Education, Section 13 - Agricultural and Mechanical College|publisher=State of Texas|url=http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001300.html|accessdate=2007-08-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610143937/http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001300.html |archivedate = June 10, 2007|deadurl=yes|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature provided [[United States dollar|US$]]75,000 for the construction of buildings at the new school, and state leaders invested profits from the sale of {{convert|180000|acre|km2|-1|sp=us}} received under the [[Land-Grant College Act]] in gold frontier defense bonds, creating a permanent [[financial endowment|endowment]] for the college. A committee tasked with finding a home for the new college chose [[Brazos County, Texas|Brazos County]], which agreed to donate {{convert|2416|acre|km2|-1|sp=us}} of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Dethloff|first = Henry C.|authorlink=Henry C.

The college officially opened on October 4, 1876 with six professors. Forty&amp;nbsp;students were present on the first day of classes, but by the end of the school year the number had grown to 106&amp;nbsp;students. Only men were admitted, and all students were required to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. The campus bore minimal resemblance to its modern counterpart. Wild animals roamed freely around the campus, and the area served as a meeting point for the [[Great Western Cattle Trail]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dethloff1617&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Dethloff | first = Henry C.|authorlink=Henry C. Dethloff | title =A Pictorial History of Texas A&amp;M University, 1876–1976 | place=[[College Station, Texas|]], Texas | publisher =Texas A&amp;M University Press | year =1975 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its name, the college taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on classical studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics. After four years, students could attain degrees in scientific agriculture, [[civil engineering|civil]] and mining engineering, and language and literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;dethloff18&quot;&gt;Dethloff (1975), p 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Local farmers complained that the college was abusing its mission, and, in November 1879, the president and faculty were replaced and given a mandated curriculum in agriculture and engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

During these early years, student life was molded by the Corps of Cadets. The Corps was divided into a battalion of three companies, and rivalry among the companies was strong, giving birth to the Aggie spirit and future [[Traditions of Texas A&amp;M University|traditions]]. No bonfires, [[Midnight Yell Practice|yell practices]], or [[Texas Aggies|athletics teams]] existed as yet, and social clubs and fraternities were discouraged.&lt;ref name=&quot;dethloff2122&quot;&gt;Dethloff (1975), pp 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment, which had climbed as high as 500&amp;nbsp;students, declined to only 80&amp;nbsp;students in 1883, the year the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] opened in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas. Although the [[Texas Constitution]] specified that the Agricultural and Mechanical College was to be a branch of a proposed University of Texas,&lt;ref name=&quot;txconstitution&quot;/&gt; the Austin school was established with a separate Board of Regents. Texas A.M.C. continued to be governed by its own Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

The two Texas schools quickly began to battle over the limited funds that the state legislature made available for higher education. In 1887, the [[Texas Agricultural Experiment Station]] was established at Texas A.M.C., enabling the college to gain more funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; Many residents of the state saw little need for two colleges in Texas, and some wanted to close the agricultural and mechanical school.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;/&gt;

== Sul Ross era ==
[[Image:Lawrence Sullivan Ross.jpg|thumb|left|Lawrence Sullivan Ross]]
[[Image:TexasA&amp;MCampus 1902.jpg|thumb|right|Texas A&amp;M University in 1902]]
Texas A.M.C. president [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross]], known affectionately to students as &quot;Sully&quot;, is credited for saving the school from closure and transforming it into a respected military institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last=Ferrell | first=Christopher | title=Ross Elevated College from 'Reform School' | newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle | year=2001 | url=http://theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1rossbio.htm | accessdate=2008-06-24 | format= – &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AFerrell+intitle%3ARoss+Elevated+College+from+%27Reform+School%27&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2001&amp;as_yhi=2001&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross, the immediate past [[governor of Texas]], had been a well-respected Confederate [[Brigadier General]] and enjoyed a good reputation among state residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

When Ross arrived at the school, he found no running water, a housing shortage, a disgruntled faculty, and many students running wild. As Ross began to make improvements, parents began to send their children to the school in the hopes that they would learn from Ross's example.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;/&gt; Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A&amp;M professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;/&gt;

Under Ross's {{nowrap|seven and one-half year}} tenure, many enduring Aggie traditions formed. These traditions include the first [[Traditions of texas a&amp;m#Aggie Ring|Aggie Ring]], the first yearbook, and the formation of the [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band|Aggie Band]]. Ross's tenure also saw the school's first intercollegiate [[American football|football]] game, played against the University of Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;/&gt;

== Program expansion ==
[[Image:Texas A&amp;M Tent Row.jpg|thumb|right|A&amp;M Tent Row in 1910]]
By 1910, the school listed {{nowrap|eight degree programs}}, including agriculture, [[architecture]], [[agricultural engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[textile engineering]]. {{nowrap|Five years}} later the state legislature, in cooperation with the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], established the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, organized the Texas Forest Service, and authorized a [[Texas A&amp;M College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences|School of Veterinary Medicine]] at the college.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; The college was unprepared for the growth, and for the next {{nowrap|ten years}} {{nowrap|several hundred students}} lived in tents in a field in the middle of campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;liffick&quot;/&gt;

During this time, women were also given a more official standing. The Texas Legislature in 1911 refused to give A&amp;M permission to hold a summer semester unless women were also permitted to attend. For the next several decades during the summers cadets were not required to be in uniform and women could attend class and participate in [[intramural]] activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;/&gt;

Texas A&amp;M graduates were called to use their military training during World War I, and by 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, a larger percentage than any other college or university.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; In early September 1918, the entire senior class was mustered into military service, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year. Many of the seniors were fighting in France when the war ended two months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;liffick&quot;&gt;

In total, over 1200 former students served as commissioned officers during World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

[[Texas A&amp;M Hillel]], the oldest Hillel organization in the United States, was founded in 1920. The organization occurred three years before the national [[Hillel Foundation]] was organized at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=abwSjUgVQwIC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=texas+a%26m+hillel&amp;sig=ACfU3U30Xh9TCM_YhhQJ2GihECDKVRsaGA From Christian Science to Jewish Science: Spiritual Healing and American Jews] [[Oxford University Press]] page 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jewishweek.org/news/newscontent.php3?artid=10860 | publisher=[[The Jewish Week]] | title=A Cushy Fit In Bush Country | author=Gabrielle Birkner | date=2005-05-06 | accessdate=2007-12-30| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050516092959/http://jewishweek.org/news/newscontent.php3?artid=10860| archivedate = May 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Texas A&amp;M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science. The first graduate school was organized in 1924,&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; and, in 1925, Mary Evelyn Crawford Locke became the first female to receive a diploma from Texas A&amp;M, although she was not allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;crawford&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Crawford Learning Community | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Department of General Academic Programs | url=http://aggieaccess2.tamu.edu/crawfordlearningcomm.aspx | accessdate=2008-06-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727195438/http://aggieaccess2.tamu.edu/crawfordlearningcomm.aspx|archivedate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month the Board of Directors officially prohibited all women from enrolling. In 1926, they codified that women in summer school had an unofficial status and could not pursue a degree. By 1930, however, over {{nowrap|1800 women}} had attended classes at A&amp;M.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;/&gt;

In the late 1920s, following the discovery of oil on university lands, Texas A&amp;M and the University of Texas negotiated a settlement for the division of the [[Permanent University Fund]] which enabled A&amp;M to receive one-third of the revenue. This guaranteed wealth enabled A&amp;M to expand. Enrollment increased even during the [[Great Depression]], as student cooperative housing projects enabled the students to attend the school at low costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; During the Depression, as professors were forced to accept a 25% pay cut, the Board of Directors partially rescinded its order against female enrollment, allowing no more than {{nowrap|20 females}} at a time to enroll in the school, and further restricting the group to daughters of professors.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last=Kavanagh | first=Colleen | title=Questioning Tradition | newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle | year=2001 | url=http://theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1questioningtradition.htm | accessdate=2008-06-24 | format= – &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AKavanagh+intitle%3AQuestioning+Tradition&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2001&amp;as_yhi=2001&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas A&amp;M expanded its degree offerings in the late 1930s and awarded its first [[Ph.D.]] in 1940. Other programs at the college likewise began offering doctoral degrees throughout the next few decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

World War II gave Texas A&amp;M an opportunity to prove itself on a worldwide stage. The school produced {{nowrap|20,229 fighting men}} who served in combat; of these, 14,123 were officers, more than the combined total of the [[United States Naval Academy]] and the [[United States Military Academy]] and more than three times the totals of any other [[Senior Military College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;keepers&quot;&gt;''Keepers of the Spirit'', page 160, by John A.

In addition, the college received nationwide exposure during the war when a reporter wrote a widely distributed story about the [[Aggie Muster]] on the island of [[Corregidor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emerald&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://clubs.aggienetwork.com/emeraldcoastamc/muster.htm |title = Aggie Muster |accessdate = 2006-12-17 |publisher = Emerald Coast A&amp;M Club }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intense interest resulted in a World War II [[propaganda]] movie, ''[[We've Never Been Licked]]'', which was filmed on the A&amp;M campus and showcased many of the school traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=Movie Review: We've Never Been Licked (1943)|date=August 19, 1943|newspaper= The [[New York Times]]|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9503E0DD103CEE3BBC4152DFBE668388659EDE| accessdate=2007-08-03|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=We've Never Been Licked|publisher=AnneGwynne.Com|url=http://www.annegwynne.com/motion-picture/weve_never_been_licked.htm| accessdate=2007-08-03 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226140743/http://www.annegwynne.com/motion-picture/weve_never_been_licked.htm | archivedate=2005-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Texas A&amp;M was originally established as a branch of the yet-to-be-created University of Texas, subsequent acts of the Texas Legislature never gave the University any authority over Texas A&amp;M. This internal legal conflict in Texas was nullified in 1948 when Texas A&amp;M became the flagship school of the newly created Texas A&amp;M University System, a clear and separate institution from the University of Texas System. A&amp;M's Board of Directors continued to oversee the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;system&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = A&amp;M System History | publisher = Texas A&amp;M University System | url =http://tamusystem.tamu.edu/overview/history.html | accessdate = 2007-03-22|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070209164228/http://tamusystem.tamu.edu/overview/history.html |archivedate = February 9, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrollment soared as many former soldiers used the [[G.I. Bill]] to further their education. Unprepared for the growth, between 1949 and 1953 Texas A&amp;M used the former Bryan Air Force Base as an extension of the campus. An estimated {{nowrap|5,500 men}} lived, studied, ate, showered, and attended classes at the base, which became known as the Annex (and later as [[Riverside Campus]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;gillentine&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last=Gillentine | first=Kristy | title=Aggies recall days at Annex | newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date=March 11, 2007 | url=http://theeagle.com/stories/031107/am_20070311019.php| accessdate=2008-06-24 | format= – &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AGillentine+intitle%3AAggies+recall+days+at+Annex&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rudder era ==
[[Image:Rudder Statue.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Statue erected on the TAMU campus in honor of James Earl Rudder.]]
The Texas Legislature defeated a nonbinding resolution in the 1950s to encourage A&amp;M to admit women. The school newspaper, ''[[The Battalion]]'' began writing editorials to encourage coeducation, causing the Student Senate to demand the editor of the paper resign. Later in the year students defeated 2–1 a campus resolution on coeducation.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;/&gt;

On March 26, 1959 retired [[Major General]] [[James Earl Rudder]], who (outside of Sul Ross) arguably had the most significant effect on the campus (and especially in terms of transforming it into the modern university of today), became the 16th president of the college, his alma mater.&lt;ref name=&quot;dethloff184&quot;&gt;Dethloff (1975), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder&quot;/&gt; At the time, the college was still an all-male military school with a {{nowrap|7,500 student}} enrollment. Within several years of his arrival, the 58th Legislature of Texas officially changed the name of the school from the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Texas to Texas A&amp;M University.&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder&quot;/&gt; The Legislature specified that in the new name of the school, the A and the M were purely symbolic, reflecting the school's past, and no longer stood for &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

With Rudder's strong encouragement, in 1963, the A&amp;M Board of Directors officially reversed their stance on admitting women.&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last=Ferrell | first=Christopher | title=Rudder's influence is evident on campus | newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle | year=2001 | url=http://theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1rudderbio.htm | accessdate=2008-06-24 | format= – &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AFerrell+intitle%3ARudder%27s+influence+is+evident+on+campus&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2001&amp;as_yhi=2001&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wives and daughters of faculty, staff and students as well as female staff members were finally allowed to officially participate in undergraduate programs, although they were not permitted to join the Corps of Cadets.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;/&gt;

The following year the college was officially integrated as A&amp;M welcomed its first [[African American]] student. More change ensued, as, in 1965, the Board of Directors voted to make membership in the Corps of Cadets voluntary. The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not just those connected to students and professors, to attend the university. The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman who met the academic requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder&quot;/&gt; During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A&amp;M University. He remained at Texas A&amp;M and, in 1970, became the first African American to receive a [[D.V.M.]] degree from the College of Veterinary Medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;JLC&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tamunews.tamu.edu/archives/article.php?articleid=3934&amp;month=1&amp;year=1998 |title=First African-American Vet Grad Honored As Outstanding Alumnus |accessdate=2008-06-24 |date=1998-01-19 |last=Charleton |first=Gene |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Office of University Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rudder died in 1970, after {{nowrap|11 years}} as president of the school, Texas A&amp;M University had grown to more than {{nowrap|14,000 students}} from all {{nowrap|50 states}} and {{nowrap|75 nations}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder&quot;/&gt; The school had become [[coeducational]] and had even begun construction of an all-female dormitory.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;/&gt; The curriculum had been broadened, with upgraded academic and faculty standards, and the school had initiated a multimillion-dollar building program.&lt;ref name=&quot;dethloff188&quot;&gt;Dethloff (1975), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent years ==
On September 17, 1971, Texas A&amp;M University was one of the first four institutions to be designated a [[sea-grant college]] in recognition of oceanographic development and research. A third designation was added on August 31, 1989 when Texas A&amp;M was named a [[space-grant college]]. The university remains one of few institutions nationwide to hold designations as a [[land-grant college|land-]], [[sea-grant college|sea-]], and [[space-grant college]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = Texas Sea Grant College Program | url = http://texas-sea-grant.tamu.edu/about/about.php | accessdate = 2007-05-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070821011854/http://texas-sea-grant.tamu.edu/about/about.php |archivedate = August 21, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diversification ===
The Corps welcomed its first female members in the fall of 1974. At the time, the women were segregated into a special unit, known as W-1, and suffered harassment from many of their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;korz&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Korzenewski | first = Claire-Jean | title = The First Women to Join the Cadets | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date = September 9, 2004 | url =http://209.189.226.235/aandmnews/091004clairejean.php | accessdate = 2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nauman&quot;/&gt; Women were originally prohibited from serving in leadership positions or in the more elite Corps units such as the Fish Drill Team, the band, and Ross Volunteers. These groups were opened to female participation in 1985, following a federal court decision in a class-action lawsuit filed by a female cadet. Two years later, in 1990, female-only units were eliminated.&lt;ref name=&quot;nauman&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Nauman | first = Brett | title = Women Joined Corps 30 Years Ago | newspaper = The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date = September 10, 2004 | url =http://www.theeagle.com/aandmnews/091004womencadets.php | accessdate = 2007-03-22 | format =  – &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3ANauman+intitle%3AWomen+Joined+Corps+30+Years+Ago&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1976, the university denied official recognition to the Gay Student Services Organization on the grounds that homosexuality was illegal in Texas, and the group's stated goals—offering referral services and providing educational information to students—were actually the responsibility of university staff.&lt;ref name=pinello&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinello|first=Daniel R.|title=Gay rights and American law|publisher=University of Cambridge|date=2003|oclc=051012147|pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students sued the university for violation of their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to freedom of speech in February 1977. For six years, ''[[Gay Student Services v. Texas A&amp;M University]]'' wound its way through the courts; although the trial court ruled in favor of Texas A&amp;M several times, the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]] repeatedly overturned the verdict.&lt;ref name=pinello/&gt;  The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declined to review the case, letting stand the circuit court ruling that the students' free speech rights had been compromised.&lt;ref name=greenhouse&gt;{{Cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|title=Supreme Court Roundup; Case of Ministry Student is Accepted|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 2, 1985|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/02/us/supreme-court-roundup-case-of-ministry-student-is-accepted.html?&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=October 28, 2009|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidential library ===
[[Image:BushLibrary.JPG|thumb|left|George Bush Presidential Library]]
The [[George Bush Presidential Library]] was established in 1997 on {{convert|90|acre|m2|-1|sp=us}} of land donated by Texas A&amp;M at the western edge of the campus. This tenth presidential library was built between 1995 and 1997 and contains the presidential and vice-presidential papers of [[George H.W. Bush]] and the vice-presidential papers of [[Dan Quayle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bushmaterials&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Birth of the Tenth Presidential Library: The Bush Presidential Materials Project, 1993–1994 | publisher = George Bush Presidential Library | url=http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/giq.html | accessdate=2007-03-22 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807120208/http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/giq.html | archivedate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To coincide with the opening of the George Bush Presidential Library, Texas A&amp;M established the [[George Bush School of Government and Public Service]]. The school, which offers a master's degree in public policy and one in international affairs as well as two research degrees, officially launched in 1997. It became a separate school within the university in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;bushhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The Bush School of Government and Public Service: History | publisher = Texas A&amp;M University | year=2005 | url=http://bush.tamu.edu/about%5Fus/history/ | accessdate=2007-03-22 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624193315/http://bush.tamu.edu/about_us/history/ | archivedate=2007-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bonfire collapse ===
{{Main article|Aggie Bonfire}}
[[Image:Bonfire-Daylight-Recovery.JPG|thumb|right|Bonfire Recovery, November 19, 1999]]
At 2:42&amp;nbsp;a.m. on November 18, 1999, the partially completed [[Aggie Bonfire]], standing {{convert|40|ft|m|0|sp=us}} tall and consisting of about {{nowrap|5000 logs}}, collapsed during construction. Of the {{nowrap|58 students}} and former students working on the stack, 12 were killed and 27 others were injured. The incident received nationwide attention, with over {{nowrap|50 satellite trucks}} broadcasting from the Texas A&amp;M campus within hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;homeland&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Cook | first=John Lee, Jr. | title=Bonfire Collapse | publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security | url=http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/tr-133-508.pdf | format=[[PDF]] | accessdate=2007-03-03 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207014046/http://www.usfa.dhs.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/tr-133-508.pdf | archivedate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 1999, the date that Bonfire would have burned, Aggies instead held a vigil and remembrance ceremony on site. Over {{nowrap|40,000 people}}, including former President George H.W. Bush and his wife [[Barbara Bush|Barbara]] and then-Texas governor [[George W. Bush]] and his wife [[Laura Bush|Laura]], lit candles and observed up to {{nowrap|two hours}} of silence at the site of the Bonfire collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitmarsch&quot; &gt;{{Cite news | last=Whitmarsch | first=Geneva | title=Thousands Mourn Fallen Aggies | newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date=November 26, 1999 | url=http://theeagle.com/bonfire/storyarchive/november1999/261199a.htm| accessdate=2008-06-24 | format= – &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AWhitmarsch+intitle%3AThousands+Mourn+Fallen+Aggies&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commission put together by Texas A&amp;M University discovered that a number of factors led to the Bonfire collapse, including &quot;excessive internal stresses&quot; on the logs and &quot;inadequate containment strength&quot;, where the wiring used to tie the logs together was not strong enough. The wiring broke after logs from upper tiers were &quot;wedged&quot; into lower tiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;homeland&quot;/&gt;

Texas A&amp;M officials, Bonfire student leaders, and the university itself were the subject of several lawsuits by parents of the students injured or killed in the collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;lebas&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last=LeBas | first=John | title=Suits claim A&amp;M tried to skirt Bonfire liability | newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle | date=June 23, 2002 | url=http://theeagle.com/aandmnews/062302bonfireclaims.htm | accessdate=2008-06-24 | format= – &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3ALeBas+intitle%3ASuits+claim+A%26M+tried+to+skirt+Bonfire+liability&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 2004, Federal Judge [[Samuel B.

=== Vision 2020 ===
In 1997, university president Ray Bowen appointed a task force to create a new [[strategic plan]] for the university. The task force, made up of more than 250 faculty, staff, students, former students, local residents, and various private- and public-sector representatives, devoted more than two years to examining all aspects of the university and studying benchmark institutions before unveiling the plan, dubbed Vision 2020, in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;vision2020&quot;/&gt;

Vision 2020's goal is to make Texas A&amp;M University recognized as a consensus &quot;top 10&quot; public university by the year 2020. The plan identifies {{nowrap|12 areas}} in which the university should focus on improving.&lt;ref name=&quot;vision2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tamu.edu/vision2020/ |title = Introduction |accessdate = 2007-01-02 |date = |publisher = Texas A&amp;M University |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070101033512/http://www.tamu.edu/vision2020/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Gates|Dr. Robert M.

* Increasing the size of the faculty by {{nowrap|447 positions}} within {{nowrap|five years}}.
* Building new academic facilities totaling roughly {{nowrap|US$272 million}}.
* Enriching the undergraduate and graduate education experience.
[[Image:TAMU CE2.JPG|thumb|right|The Jack E. Brown Chemical Engineering Building opened in 2004.]]
Gates' leadership resulted in the largest academic expansion in the university's history. As of September 8, 2006, Vision 2020's progress includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://convocation.tamu.edu/convaddress/speeches/2006-academic-convocation-and-investiture | title=Convocation Address: 2006 |accessdate=2012-08-25 |date=2006-09-08 | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 346 new teachers and researchers from around the world with completion slated for September 1, 2007
* Hispanic enrollment increased 9.6%, African American enrollment increased 9.4%, and Asian American enrollment rose 24.3% compared to 2005.
* Over {{nowrap|$500 million}} in new construction across campus including Interdisciplinary Life Sciences Building ({{nowrap|US$95 million}}), two emerging technologies buildings ({{nowrap|US$50 million}} each), and a nuclear [[magnetic resonance imaging]] building ({{nowrap|US$8 million}}).
* The student-faculty ratio dropped from 22:1 in 2001 to 20:1 in the fall of 2005.

=== Hurricane relief ===
Following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, Texas A&amp;M opened [[Reed Arena]] as a temporary shelter to house over {{nowrap|200 evacuees}} from [[New Orleans]]. Although school was barely in session and there was minimal notice, the students and staff of A&amp;M prepared the facility, setting up several hundred beds on the arena floor and making arrangements for the evacuees to get new clothes and have medical checks. Aggie students organized a child care facility, and Aggie athletes escorted teenagers to the Aggie Rec Center to play basketball.&lt;ref name=&quot;gates&quot; &gt;{{cite web | last=Gates | first=Robert M. | authorlink=Robert Gates | title=Relief Efforts at Texas A&amp;M | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University | date=September 6, 2005 | url=http://giving.tamu.edu/content/content.php?KatrinaLetter | accessdate=2007-02-27 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214111536/http://giving.tamu.edu/content/content.php?KatrinaLetter | archivedate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than three weeks later, Reed Arena was again opened as a temporary shelter for people fleeing [[Hurricane Rita]].&lt;ref name=&quot;watkins&quot; &gt;{{Cite news | last = Watkins | first = Matthew | title = A&amp;M to host coastal evacuees, hospital transfers | newspaper = The Battalion | date = September 22, 2005 | url =http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2005/09/22/News/Am.To.Host.Coastal.Evacuees.Hospital.Transfers-994365.shtml | accessdate = 2007-02-27 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
