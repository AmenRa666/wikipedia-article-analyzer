'''Daisy Jugadai Napaltjarri''' (c. 1955 – 2008) was a [[Pintupi language|Pintupi-Luritja]]-speaking [[Indigenous Australian|Indigenous]] [[artist]] from Australia's [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]] region, and sister of artist [[Molly Jugadai Napaltjarri]]. Daisy Jugadai lived and painted at [[Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory]]. There she played a significant role in the establishment of Ikuntji Women's Centre, where many artists of the region have worked.

Influenced by the [[Hermannsburg School]], Jugadai's paintings reflect her ''[[Dreaming (spirituality)|Tjuukurrpa]]'', the complex spiritual knowledge and relationships between her and her landscape. The paintings also reflect fine observation of the structures of the vegetation and environment. Jugadai's works were selected for exhibition at the [[National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award]]s five times between 1993 and 2001, and she was a section winner in 2000. Her paintings are held in major collections including the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory]].

==Life==

Daisy Jugadai was born circa 1955 at [[Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory]], daughter of artists Narputta Nangala and Timmy Jugadai Tjungurrayi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnberg213&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Birnberg|first=Margo|author2=Janusz Kreczmanski|title=Aboriginal Artist Dictionary of Biographies: Australian Western, Central Desert and Kimberley Region|publisher=J.B. Publishing|location=Marleston, South Australia|year=2004|pages=213–214|isbn=1-876622-47-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous people operate using a different conception of time from non-Indigenous Australians, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events.&lt;ref name=&quot;BirnbergIntro&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Birnberg|first=Margo|author2=Janusz Kreczmanski|title=Aboriginal Artist Dictionary of Biographies: Australian Western, Central Desert and Kimberley Region|publisher=J.B. Publishing|pages=10–12|location=Marleston, South Australia|year=2004|isbn=1-876622-47-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of Papunya and Haasts Bluff, such as Daisy, speak a variety of the [[Pintupi language]] referred to as Pintupi-Luritja,&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnberg213&quot;/&gt; a [[Western Desert language|Western Desert dialect]]. ''[[Napaljarri (skin name)|Napaltjarri]]'' (in Western Desert dialects) or ''Napaljarri'' (in Warlpiri) is a [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin name]], one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the [[kinship system]] of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular [[totem]]s. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.org.au/People_Culture/kinship/kinship.html|title=Kinship and skin names|work=People and culture|publisher=Central Land Council|accessdate=23 October 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clc.org.au%2FPeople_Culture%2Fkinship%2Fkinship.html&amp;date=2010-10-11|archivedate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;de Brabander&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=De Brabander|first=Dallas|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra|year=1994|volume=2|page=977|chapter=Sections|isbn=978-0-85575-234-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus &quot;Daisy Jugadai&quot; is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.

Jugadai's childhood was spent at both Haasts Bluff and a nearby camp, Five Mile, while she was schooled at Papunya. She married Kelly Multa, and they had a daughter, Agnes. They lived on an [[outstation]], Kungkayunti, but Daisy moved back to Haasts Bluff when Kelly died.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaisyAA&quot;/&gt; It was not until the 1990s that she was remarried, to an [[Elcho Island]]er, after which she travelled regularly between [[Arnhem Land, Northern Territory|Arnhem Land]] and Haasts Bluff. Jugadai died in 2008, her funeral held at Haasts Bluff, where she was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaisyAA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|year=2008|title=Daisy Napaltjarri Jugadai (art tribute)|journal=Art and Australia|volume=46|issue=1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daisy Jugadai had an older sister, artist [[Molly Jugadai Napaltjarri]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Mandy|author2=Robin, Libby |author3=Smith, Mike |title=Strata: deserts past, present and future|publisher=Land &amp; Water Australia|location=Canberra|year=2005|url=http://geography.anu.edu.au/publications/books/pdfs/strata.pdf|isbn=0-9577481-4-0 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgeography.anu.edu.au%2Fpublications%2Fbooks%2Fpdfs%2Fstrata.pdf&amp;date=2010-10-28 |archivedate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another sister, Ester, who predeceased her.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaisyAA&quot;/&gt;

===Background===
The [[contemporary Indigenous Australian art]] movement began in the western desert in 1971, when Indigenous men at [[Papunya]] took up painting, led by elders such as [[Kaapa Tjampitjinpa]], and assisted by teacher [[Geoffrey Bardon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardon&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bardon|first=Geoffrey|author2=James Bardon|title=Papunya – A place made after the story: The beginnings of the Western Desert painting movement|publisher=Miegunyah Press|location=University of Melbourne|year=2007|isbn=0-522-85434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dussart06&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dussart|first=Francoise|year=2006|title=Canvassing identities: reflecting on the acrylic art movement in an Australian Aboriginal settlement|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=30|pages=156–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morphy99&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Morphy|first=Howard|title=Aboriginal Art|publisher=Phaidon|location=London|year=1999|pages=261–316|isbn=0-7148-3752-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first artists, including all of the founders of the [[Papunya Tula]] artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strocchi06&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|year=2006|title=Minyma Tjukurrpa: Kintore / Haasts Bluff Canvas Project: Dancing women to famous painters|journal=Artlink|volume=26|issue=4|pages=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women in the communities wished to participate, and in the 1990s many began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the [[outstation movement|outstations]], people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morphy99&quot;/&gt;

Daisy Jugadai came from a family of painters, including her uncle Uta Uta Tjangala and her mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAAOV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/daisy-napaltjarri-jugadai/biography/?|title=Daisy Napaltjarri Jugadai b. 1956 Haasts Bluff, NT|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|year=1994|work=Biography|publisher=Design &amp; Art Australia Online|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She learned to draw during her schooling at Papunya and Haasts Bluff,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinert613&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleinert|first=Sylvia|author2=Margot Neale|title=The Oxford Companion to Aboriginal art and culture|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2000|isbn=0-19-550649-9|page=613}}&lt;/ref&gt; but her first experience as a painter came working on backgrounds for the pictures created by her father.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAAOV&quot;/&gt; From the Pintupi/Luritja language group, Daisy Jugadai was one of a range of artists who came to painting through the Ikuntji Women's Centre in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnberg213&quot;/&gt; She is credited with a significant role in the centre's establishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinert613&quot;/&gt; She began with [[screen printing]] and [[linocut]] printmaking, but quickly shifted to acrylic painting, producing many of her best works during the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinert613&quot;/&gt; Western Desert artists such as Daisy Jugadai will frequently paint particular '[[dreaming (spirituality)|dreamings]]' or ''Tjukurrpa'' for which they have personal responsibility or rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnsonIntro&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|title=Aboriginal Artists of the Western Desert: A Biographical Dictionary|chapter=Introduction|publisher=Craftsman House|location=Roseville East, NSW|pages=7–12|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex concept, ''Tjukurrpa'' refers to the spiritual knowledge of the landscape and custodianship of it; it also refers to laws, rules or stories that people must maintain and re-produce in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/culture/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711104046/http://environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/culture/index.html|archivedate=2009-07-11|title=Tjukurpa – Anangu culture|year=2009|work=Uluru – Kata Tjuta National Park|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|accessdate=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=San Roque|first=Craig|year=2006|title=On ''Tjukurrpa'', Painting Up, and Building Thought|journal=Social Analysis|volume=50|issue=2|pages=148–172|doi=10.3167/015597706780810862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daisy Jugadai portrayed in her art both those for which she had personal responsibility, and those of her late husband and late father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinert613&quot;/&gt; These included [[Honeypot ant|honey ant]], [[Triodia (plant genus)|spinifex]] and emu dreamings;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson116&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|title=Aboriginal Artists of the Western Desert: A Biographical Dictionary|publisher=Craftsman House|page=116|location=Roseville East, NSW|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; geographical locations that were the settings for these paintings included Muruntji waterhole and Talabarrdi, and other locations around Kungkayunti, where her family had lived for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnberg213&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NGA1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=8591|title=Kumantjai Rockhole|last=Napaltjarri Jugadai|first=Daisy|year=1996|work=Collection search|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
[[File:Memory and Five Mile Creek (1995).jpg|right|thumb|alt=An acrylic painting showing a stylised blue sky with clouds, red hills, and trees and other vegetation interspersed by waterbeds|''Memory and Five Mile Creek'' (1995)]]
Throughout the 1990s, Daisy Jugadai was a regular exhibitor at the [[Araluen Centre for Arts and Entertainment|Araluen Art Centre]] in Alice Springs, and well as other major exhibitions such as the Australian Heritage Art Awards in Canberra in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnberg213&quot;/&gt; Recognition came in 1993, in two forms: an award of a Northern Territory Women's Fellowship;&lt;ref name=&quot;DaisyAA&quot;/&gt; and the purchase by the Araluen Arts Centre of a work exhibited in its annual art award.&lt;ref name=DAAOV/&gt; Within her community she was an administrator as well as an artist. A member of the Ikuntji Women's Centre and a representative on Ikuntji Community Council, Daisy was one of those who successfully lobbied to have artist Marina Strocchi appointed as an art centre coordinator in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaisyAA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IAD&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|title=Ikuntji: paintings from Haasts Bluff 1992 – 1994|publisher=IAD Press|location=Alice Springs|year=1995|page=8|isbn=0-949659-86-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respect between the two women was mutual: Daisy was one of a group of artists whose work was selected for an exhibition that toured regional Australian public galleries in 1999–2000, ''Ikuntji tjuta – touring'', which was curated by Marina Strocchi, the art centre coordinator who had first helped develop the Ikuntji centre in Haasts Bluff some years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strocchi99&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|title=Ikuntji tjuta: touring|publisher=Campbelltown City Bicentennial Art Gallery|location=Campbelltown, NSW|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works by Daisy Jugadai are held by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DaisyNGV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/ngvschools/TraditionAndTransformation/artworks/Memory-and-Five-Mile-Creek/|title=Daisy Napaljarri Jugadai – Memory and Five Mile Creek 1995 |work=NGV Collection|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnberg213&quot;/&gt; They are also held in major private collections, such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection),&lt;ref name=&quot;Nangara&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nangara.com/collection/artists.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913190557/http://www.nangara.com/collection/artists.htm|archivedate=2009-09-13|title=The artists|publisher=Nangara: the Australian Aboriginal art exhibition|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by [[Edith Cowan University]].&lt;ref name=MJA&gt;{{cite journal|date=20 May 2002|title=[Cover image] |journal=Medical Journal of Australia|volume=176|issue=10|page=453|url=https://www.mja.com.au/system/files/issues/176_10_200502/martin_200502.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; First exhibiting in the [[National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award]]s in 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson116&quot;/&gt; she was a finalist on several occasions including 1995, 1998 and 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnberg213&quot;/&gt; and a section winner in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaisyAA&quot;/&gt; Her 1994 entry in the award, ''Karu kapingku pungu (Creek after rain)'', belongs to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATSIAA1994&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natsiaadigitisation.nt.gov.au/docs/index.php?typ=artwork&amp;p1=ABART-1695|title=Karu kapingku pungu (Creek after rain)|last=Jugadai|first=Daisy Napaltjarri|year=1994|work=The MAGNT National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA) Collection|publisher=Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is also featured alongside other Indigenous artists such as [[Gloria Petyarre]] in the Melbourne international airport terminal, completed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Battersby|first=Jean|year=1996|title=Art and Airports 2|journal=Craft Arts International|volume=37|pages=49–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Antiti, near Five Mile'', a 1998 painting, has appeared as cover art on an issue of the [[Medical Journal of Australia]].&lt;ref name=MJA/&gt;

===Style===
Alone amongst the Ikuntji artists, Daisy Jugadai worked at an easel. She cited the [[Hermannsburg School]], a group of Indigenous artists including [[Albert Namatjira]] who began painting at [[Hermannsburg, Northern Territory|Hermannsburg Mission]] in the 1930s, as an influence on her work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleinert613&quot;/&gt; ''Memory and Five Mile Creek'' (1995) represents the country of her childhood. It shows the hills of the region in elevation rather than in plan, and represents the range of vegetation typical of that country.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaisyNGV&quot;/&gt; Curator Marina Strocchi notes how Daisy Jugadai's painting reflects close observation of the complex structures of the vegetation and environment, its features &quot;obsessively detailed&quot;, with the artist &quot;devotedly [including] all the [[Bushfood|bush tucker]] of that area&quot;, as well as choosing &quot;a time of year in which to depict her country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strocchi99&quot;/&gt; Vegetation would be carefully painted with a trimmed brush, while even finer detail, such as pollen, would be rendered using a matchstick. Clouds were always the final features to be included. Despite this devotion to detail, Daisy preferred to paint large canvasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaisyAA&quot;/&gt; ''Memory and Five Mile Creek'' was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2004–05 exhibition &quot;Aboriginal Art Post 1984&quot; and reviewer Miriam Cosic, while noting its &quot;naive charm&quot;, also drew attention to the work's title and the implication that, like other more explicitly political painters of her era, &quot;she too is talking of violent dispossession&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cosic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=A revolutionary shift in tone|last=Cosic|first=Miriam|date=20 December 2004|work=The Australian|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Mandy Martin, who participated in a 2005 collaboration with several painters from the Haasts Bluff region, thought that Daisy's rendering of bush tucker was achieved with a &quot;stylised but dazzling personal language&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Mandy|title=Strata: deserts past, present and future|editor=Mandy Martin, Libby Robin and Mike Smith|publisher=Land &amp; Water Australia|location=Canberra|year=2005|page=15|chapter=Desert of the mind's eye|isbn=0-9577481-4-0|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320082300/http://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/files/panel/317/strata_pdf_31320.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and critic Morag Fraser described Daisy's work as &quot;extraordinary&quot;, observing that in Daisy's paintings &quot;nature is so wholly internalised, and its rendering so uninhibited.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Morag|year=1999|title=Substance and illusion: crosscurrents in Australian landscape painting and Australian literature|journal=LiNQ|volume=26|issue=1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinguished artist in her community, her death coincided with a vigorous renewal of artistic expression amongst her successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Sasha|year=2008|title=Ikuntji Art Centre: Haasts Bluff|journal=Australian Art Collector|volume=46|url=http://www.artcollector.net.au/IkuntjiArtCentreHaastsBluff|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
