A '''synthetic diamond''' (also known as an '''artificial diamond''', '''cultured diamond''', or '''cultivated diamond''') is [[diamond]] produced in an artificial process, as opposed to natural diamonds, which are created by [[geology|geological]] processes. Synthetic diamond is also widely known as '''HPHT diamond''' or '''CVD diamond''' after the two common production methods (referring to the high-pressure high-temperature and [[chemical vapor deposition]] crystal formation methods, respectively). While the term ''synthetic'' is associated by consumers with imitation products, artificial diamonds are made of the same material (pure carbon, crystallized in isotropic 3D form).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20081009181207/http://ftc.gov/os/2008/07/G711001jewelryguides.pdf 16 C.F.R. Part 23: Guides For The Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries: Federal Trade Commission Letter Declining To Amend The Guides With Respect To Use Of The Term &quot;Cultured&quot;], U.S. Federal Trade Commission, July 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the [[Federal Trade Commission]] has indicated that the alternative terms ''laboratory-grown'', ''laboratory-created'', and ''[manufacturer-name]-created'' &quot;would more clearly communicate the nature of the stone&quot;.

Numerous claims of diamond synthesis were documented between 1879 and 1928; most of those attempts were carefully analyzed but none were confirmed. In the 1940s, systematic research began in the United States, Sweden and the [[Soviet Union]] to grow diamonds using CVD and HPHT processes. The first reproducible synthesis was reported around 1953. Those two processes still dominate the production of synthetic diamond. A third method, known as [[Detonation nanodiamond|detonation]] synthesis, entered the diamond market in the late 1990s. In this process, nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a detonation of carbon-containing explosives. A fourth method, treating graphite with high-power [[ultrasound]], has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but currently has no commercial application.

The properties of synthetic diamond depend on the details of the manufacturing processes; however, some synthetic diamonds (whether formed by HPHT or CVD) have properties such as [[hardness]], [[thermal conductivity]] and [[electron mobility]] that are superior to those of most naturally formed diamonds. Synthetic diamond is widely used in [[abrasive]]s, in cutting and polishing tools and in [[heat sink]]s. Electronic applications of synthetic diamond are being developed, including high-power [[switch]]es at [[power station]]s, high-frequency [[field-effect transistor]]s and [[light-emitting diode]]s. Synthetic diamond detectors of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light or high-energy particles are used at high-energy research facilities and are available commercially. Because of its unique combination of thermal and chemical stability, low thermal expansion and high optical transparency in a wide spectral range, synthetic diamond is becoming the most popular material for optical windows in high-power [[Carbon dioxide laser|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lasers]] and [[gyrotron]]s.  It is estimated that 98% of industrial grade diamond demand is supplied with synthetic diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 4, 2013|url=http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2013/01/22/the-state-of-2013-global-rough-diamond-supply|title=The state of 2013 global rough diamond supply|publisher=Resource Investor|date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both CVD and HPHT diamonds can be cut into gems and various colors can be produced: clear white, yellow, brown, blue, green and orange. The appearance of synthetic gems on the market created major concerns in the diamond trading business, as a result of which special [[optical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] devices and techniques have been developed to distinguish synthetic and natural diamonds.

Their method involved heating [[charcoal]] at up to 3500&amp;nbsp;°C with iron inside a [[carbon]] crucible in a furnace. Whereas Hannay used a flame-heated tube, Moissan applied his newly developed [[electric arc furnace]], in which an electric arc was struck between carbon rods inside blocks of [[lime (mineral)|lime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Royère, C. |year=1999|title=The electric furnace of Henri Moissan at one hundred years: connection with the electric furnace, the solar furnace, the plasma furnace?|journal=Annales pharmaceutiques françaises|volume=57|pmid=10365467|issue= 2|pages= 116–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molten iron was then rapidly cooled by immersion in water. The contraction generated by the cooling supposedly produced the high pressure required to transform graphite into diamond. Moissan published his work in a series of articles in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Moissan, H. |title = Nouvelles expériences sur la reproduction du diamant| year = 1894|journal = Comptes Rendus|volume = 118|pages = 320–326|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3074r/f320.image.langEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most definitive replication attempts were performed by Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons]]. A prominent scientist and engineer known for his invention of the [[steam turbine]], he spent about 40 years (1882–1922) and a considerable part of his fortune trying to reproduce the experiments of Moissan and Hannay, but also adapted processes of his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZqwJk5QvG8gC&amp;pg=PA194|page=194|title=50 years progress in crystal growth: a reprint collection|author=Feigelson, R.

Desch to publish an article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Desch, C.H.| title = The Problem of Artificial Production of Diamonds| journal = Nature| volume = 121|pages = 799–800 |year = 1928|doi = 10.1038/121799a0| issue=3055|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..799C }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he stated his belief that no synthetic diamonds (including those of Moissan and others) had been produced up to that date. He suggested that most diamonds that had been produced up to that point were likely synthetic [[spinel]].&lt;ref name=lonsdale /&gt;

=== GE diamond project ===
[[File:Beltpress.gif|thumb|alt=A 3-meter tall press|A belt press produced in the 1980s by [[Kobe Steel Group|KOBELCO]]]]

In 1941, an agreement was made between the [[General Electric]] (GE), Norton and Carborundum companies to further develop diamond synthesis. They were able to heat carbon to about {{convert|3000|C}} under a pressure of {{convert|3.5|GPa|lk=in}} for a few seconds. Soon thereafter, the [[Second World War]] interrupted the project. It was resumed in 1951 at the Schenectady Laboratories of GE, and a high-pressure diamond group was formed with Francis P. Bundy and H.M. Strong. [[Howard Tracy Hall|Tracy Hall]] and others joined this project shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name = makers&gt;{{cite book|author = Hazen, R. M. |title = The diamond makers|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1999|pages = 100–113| isbn = 0-521-65474-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schenectady group improved on the [[diamond anvil cell|anvils]] designed by [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Percy Bridgman]], who received a [[Nobel Prize]] for his work in 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used [[tungsten carbide]] anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a [[catlinite]] container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donoghue|O'Donoghue]], p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.&lt;ref name=er&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bovenkerk|first1=H. P.|last2=Bundy|first2=F. P.|last3=Chrenko|first3=R. M.|last4=Codella|first4=P. J.|last5=Strong|first5=H. M.|last6=Wentorf|first6=R.

Hall achieved the first commercially successful synthesis of diamond on December 16, 1954, and this was announced on February 15, 1955. His breakthrough was using a &quot;belt&quot; press, which was capable of producing pressures above {{convert|10|GPa|abbr=on}} and temperatures above {{convert|2000|C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hall, H. T. |title= Ultra-high pressure apparatus |doi =10.1063/1.1716907| journal= Rev. Sci.

Those metals acted as a &quot;solvent-[[catalyst]]&quot;, which both dissolved carbon and accelerated its conversion into diamond. The largest diamond he produced was {{convert|0.15|mm|abbr=on}} across; it was too small and visually imperfect for jewelry, but usable in industrial abrasives. Hall's co-workers were able to replicate his work, and the discovery was published in the major journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bundy, F. P.; Hall, H.

=== Later developments ===
An independent diamond synthesis was achieved on February 16, 1953 in [[Stockholm]] by the [[ASEA]] (Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), one of Sweden's major electrical manufacturing companies. Starting in 1949, ASEA employed a team of five scientists and engineers as part of a top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used a bulky split-sphere apparatus designed by [[Baltzar von Platen (inventor)|Baltzar von Platen]] and Anders Kämpe.&lt;ref name = makers /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liander, H.  |author2=Lundblad, E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal =ASEA Journal |title = Artificial diamonds| volume =28 |year =1955 |page= 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated 8.4&amp;nbsp;[[GPa]] for an hour. A few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size. The work was not reported until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=b31&gt;[[#Barnard|Barnard]], pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, a new competitor emerged in [[Korea]], a company named Iljin Diamond; it was followed by hundreds of Chinese enterprises. Iljin Diamond allegedly accomplished diamond synthesis in 1988 by misappropriating trade secrets from GE via a Korean former GE employee.&lt;ref&gt;General Electric v. Sung, 843 F.

[[File:Dia scalpel.jpg|thumb|alt=A diamond scalpel consisting of a yellow diamond blade attached to a pen-shaped holder|A scalpel with single-crystal synthetic diamond blade]]
Synthetic gem-quality diamond crystals were first produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded at each end with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material was placed in the center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5&amp;nbsp;GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center to the ends of the tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5&amp;nbsp;mm (1 [[Carat (unit)|carat]] or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.&lt;ref name=nature1959 /&gt;

The first gem-quality stones were always yellow to brown in color because of contamination with nitrogen. [[Inclusion (mineral)|Inclusions]] were common, especially &quot;plate-like&quot; ones from the nickel. Removing all nitrogen from the process by adding [[aluminium]] or [[titanium]] produced colorless &quot;white&quot; stones, and removing the nitrogen and adding [[boron]] produced blue ones.&lt;ref name=burns&gt;{{cite journal| author= Burns, R.

Although the GE stones and natural diamonds were chemically identical, their physical properties were not the same. The colorless stones produced strong [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]] under short-wavelength ultraviolet light, but were inert under long-wave UV. Among natural diamonds, only the rarer blue gems exhibit these properties. Unlike natural diamonds, all the GE stones showed strong yellow fluorescence under X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnard|Barnard]], p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The [[De Beers]] Diamond Research Laboratory has grown stones of up to {{convert|25|carat|g}} for research purposes. Stable HPHT conditions were kept for six weeks to grow high-quality diamonds of this size. For economic reasons, the growth of most synthetic diamonds is terminated when they reach a mass of {{convert|1|carat|mg}} to {{convert|1.5|carat|mg}}.&lt;ref name=bars /&gt;

In the 1950s, research started in the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by [[pyrolysis]] of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800&amp;nbsp;°C. This low-pressure process is known as [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, but it was not reported until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Eversole, W. G.

However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swiss lab introduces melee identifier|url=http://www.nationaljeweler.com/diamonds/grading/Swiss-lab-introduces-3328.shtml|website=[[Jewelers of America#National Jeweler|National Jeweler]]|publisher=National Jeweler|accessdate=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturing technologies ==
There are several methods used to produce synthetic diamond. The original method uses high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and is still widely used because of its relatively low cost. The process involves large presses that can weigh hundreds of tons to produce a pressure of 5&amp;nbsp;GPa at 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. The second method, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), creates a carbon [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] over a substrate onto which the carbon atoms deposit to form diamond. Other methods include explosive formation (forming [[detonation nanodiamond]]s) and [[sonication]] of graphite solutions.&lt;ref name=CVD /&gt;&lt;ref name=ozawa /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sonication&quot; /&gt;

=== High pressure, high temperature ===
[[File:Hydrostatic Synthesis.png|thumb|left|alt=A schematic drawing of a vertical cross section through a press setup. The drawing illustrates how the central unit, held by dies on its sides, is vertically compressed by two anvils|Schematic of a belt press]]
In the HPHT method, there are three main press designs used to supply the pressure and temperature necessary to produce synthetic diamond: the belt press, the cubic press and the split-sphere ([[BARS (Diamonds)|BARS]]) press. Diamond seeds are placed at the bottom of the press.
The internal part of press is heated above 1400&amp;nbsp;°C and melts the solvent metal.  The molten metal dissolves the high purity [[carbon]] source, which is then transported to the small diamond seeds and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]], forming a large synthetic diamond.&lt;ref name=&quot;d_lab&quot; /&gt;

The original GE invention by Tracy Hall uses the belt press wherein the upper and lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of the belt press uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;d_lab&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondlab.org/80-hpht_synthesis.htm |title=HPHT synthesis| publisher = International Diamond Laboratories|accessdate= May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnard|Barnard]], p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide pressure simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume.&lt;ref name=ito /&gt; The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author =Hall, H. T. |title =Ultrahigh-Pressure Research: At ultrahigh pressures new and sometimes unexpected chemical and physical events occur |url = http://www.htracyhall.org/papers/19580097.pdf|doi = 10.1126/science.128.3322.445| journal = Science| pmid =17834381 |volume =128 |year =1958| issue =3322 | bibcode=1958Sci...128..445H| pages =445–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils to achieve the same pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order [[platonic solid]], such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.&lt;ref name=ito&gt;{{cite book| author = Ito, E. |title = Multianvil cells and high-pressure experimental methods, in Treatise of Geophysics|editor = G.

=== Chemical vapor deposition ===

[[Chemical vapor deposition]] is a method by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method has been the subject of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.&lt;ref name=CVD /&gt;&lt;ref name=milos&gt;{{cite book|title =Physics and Applications of CVD Diamond|page=50; 200–240|author1=Koizumi, S. |author2=Nebel, C. E. |author3=Nesladek, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = Wiley VCH |year =2008| isbn =3-527-40801-0|url =https://books.google.com/?id=pRFUZdHb688C&amp;pg=RA1-PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CVD growth involves substrate preparation, feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber and energizing them. The substrate preparation includes choosing an appropriate material and its crystallographic orientation; cleaning it, often with a diamond powder to abrade a non-diamond substrate; and optimizing the substrate temperature (about {{nowrap|800 °C}}) during the growth through a series of test runs. The gases always include a carbon source, typically [[methane]], and hydrogen with a typical ratio of 1:99. Hydrogen is essential because it selectively etches off non-diamond carbon. The gases are ionized into chemically active [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] in the growth chamber using [[microwave]] power, a [[hot filament]], an [[Electric arc|arc discharge]], a [[welding torch]], a [[laser]], an [[electron beam]], or other means.

During the growth, the chamber materials are etched off by the plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the [[silica]] windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/pssa.200561920|title=Silicon incorporation in CVD diamond layers|year=2005|author=Barjon, J. |journal=Physica Status Solidi (a)|volume=202|pages=2177–2181|last2=Rzepka|first2=E.|last3=Jomard|first3=F.|last4=Laroche|first4=J.-M.|last5=Ballutaud|first5=D.|last6=Kociniewski|first6=T.|last7=Chevallier|first7=J.|issue=11|bibcode = 2005PSSAR.202.2177B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or moved away from the substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.&lt;ref name=CVD&gt;{{cite journal| title =Growth and application of undoped and doped diamond films |doi =10.1088/0034-4885/61/12/002|journal =Rep.

=== Detonation of explosives ===
[[File:Detonationdiamond.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=An image resembling a cluster of grape where the cluster consists of nearly spherical particles of 5-nm diameter|Electron micrograph ([[transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) of detonation nanodiamond]]
{{Main|Detonation nanodiamond}}
Diamond nanocrystals (5&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter) can be formed by detonating certain carbon-containing explosives in a metal chamber. These nanocrystals are called &quot;[[detonation nanodiamond]]&quot;. During the explosion, the pressure and temperature in the chamber become high enough to convert the carbon of the explosives into diamond. Being immersed in water, the chamber cools rapidly after the explosion, suppressing conversion of newly produced diamond into more stable graphite.&lt;ref name=udd&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(99)00354-4|title=Structure and defects of detonation synthesis nanodiamond|year=2000|author=Iakoubovskii, K. |journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=9|pages=861–865|last2=Baidakova|first2=M.V.|last3=Wouters|first3=B.H.|last4=Stesmans|first4=A.|last5=Adriaenssens|first5=G.J.|last6=Vul'|first6=A.Ya.|last7=Grobet|first7=P.J.|issue=3–6|url=http://pubman.nims.go.jp/pubman/item/escidoc:1587362:1/component/escidoc:1587361/drm861.pdf|bibcode = 2000DRM.....9..861I }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a variation of this technique, a metal tube filled with graphite powder is placed in the detonation chamber.

=== Ultrasound cavitation ===
[[micrometre|Micron]]-sized diamond crystals can be synthesized from a suspension of graphite in organic liquid at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|atmospheric pressure and room temperature]] using ultrasonic [[cavitation]]. The diamond yield is about 10% of the initial graphite weight. The estimated cost of diamond produced by this method is comparable to that of the HPHT method; the crystalline perfection of the product is significantly worse for the ultrasonic synthesis. This technique requires relatively simple equipment and procedures, but it has only been reported by two research groups, and has no industrial use {{As of|2012|lc=on}}. Numerous process parameters, such as preparation of the initial graphite powder, the choice of ultrasonic power, synthesis time and the solvent, are not yet optimized, leaving a window for potential improvement of the efficiency and reduction of the cost of the ultrasonic synthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;sonication&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title =Experimental Corroboration of the Synthesis of Diamond in the Cavitation Process| doi= 10.1134/1.1710678|journal = Doklady Physics |volume= 49 |year =2004| pages= 150–153|issue=3|last1 =Galimov|first1 =É.

== Properties ==
Traditionally, the absence of crystal flaws is considered to be the most important quality of a diamond. Purity and high crystalline perfection make diamonds transparent and clear, whereas its hardness, [[optical dispersion]] (luster) and chemical stability (combined with marketing), make it a popular gemstone. High thermal conductivity is also important for technical applications. Whereas high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties vary depending on how the diamond was created.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spear|Spear and Dismukes]], pp. 308–309&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crystallinity ===
Diamond can be one single, continuous crystal or it can be made up of many smaller crystals ([[polycrystal]]). Large, clear and transparent single-crystal diamonds are typically used in gemstones. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) consists of numerous small grains, which are easily seen by the naked eye through strong light absorption and scattering; it is unsuitable for gems and is used for industrial applications such as mining and cutting tools. Polycrystalline diamond is often described by the average size (or ''[[Crystallite|grain size]]'') of the crystals that make it up. Grain sizes range from [[nanometer]]s to hundreds of [[micrometer]]s, usually referred to as &quot;nanocrystalline&quot; and &quot;microcrystalline&quot; diamond, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2g5GJtBFwo0C&amp;pg=PA136|page=136|title=Handbook of Electrochemistry|author=Zoski, Cynthia G.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|isbn=0-444-51958-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hardness ===
Synthetic diamond is the hardest known material,&lt;ref name=blank /&gt; where hardness is defined as resistance to indentation. The hardness of synthetic diamond depends on its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the [[Miller index#Case of cubic structures|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;111&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=142–147|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jtC1mUFZfQcC&amp;pg=PA143|title=Properties, Growth and Applications of Diamond|author1=Neves, A.

=== Impurities and inclusions ===
{{Main|Crystallographic defects in diamond}}
Every diamond contains atoms other than carbon in concentrations detectable by analytical techniques. Those atoms can aggregate into macroscopic phases called inclusions. Impurities are generally avoided, but can be introduced intentionally as a way to control certain properties of the diamond. Growth processes of synthetic diamond, using solvent-catalysts, generally lead to formation of a number of impurity-related complex centers, involving transition metal atoms (such as nickel, cobalt or iron), which  affect the electronic properties of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larico|first1=R.|last2=Justo|first2=J.

=== Thermal conductivity ===
Unlike most electrical insulators, pure diamond is a good conductor of heat because of the strong [[covalent bond]]ing within the crystal. The thermal conductivity of pure diamond is the highest of any known solid. Single crystals of synthetic diamond enriched in {{SimpleNuclide2|Carbon|12}} (99.9%), [[isotopically pure diamond]], have the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of any material, 30 W/cm·K at room temperature, 7.5 times higher than [[copper]].  Natural diamond's conductivity is reduced by 1.1% by the {{SimpleNuclide2|Carbon|13|link=yes}} naturally present, which acts as an inhomogeneity in the lattice.&lt;ref name=PNU&gt;{{cite journal |title =Thermal conductivity of isotopically modified single crystal diamond| journal= Phys.

Diamond's thermal conductivity is made use of by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered [[thermistor]]s mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Wenckus, J. F.

== Applications ==

=== Machining and cutting tools ===
[[File:Diamond blade very macro.jpg|thumb|alt=A polished metal slab embedded with small diamonds|Diamonds in an [[angle grinder]] blade]]

Most industrial applications of synthetic diamond have long been associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for [[machine tool]]s and [[Cutting tool (machining)|cutting tools]]. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond can be used to polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this ability include diamond-tipped [[drill bit]]s and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an [[abrasive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Holtzapffel, C. |title=Turning And Mechanical Manipulation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=omwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 |publisher=[[Holtzapffel]] |pages=176–178 |year=1856 |isbn=1-879335-39-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining [[ferrous]] [[alloy]]s at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =The application of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool materials when drilling and reaming aluminum-based alloys including MMC| doi =10.1016/0890-6955(95)93044-7 |journal =International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture |volume =35 |year =1995 |pages = 761–774| issue =5| last1 =Coelho| first1 =R.T.| last2 =Yamada| first2 =S.| last3 =Aspinwall| first3 =D.K.| last4 =Wise| first4 =M.L.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual form of diamond in cutting tools is micrometer-sized grains dispersed in a metal matrix (usually cobalt) [[sintering|sintered]] onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools can be found in mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work has been done to coat metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title =Diamond films grown on cemented WC-Co dental burs using an improved CVD method| doi =10.1016/S0925-9635(03)00074-8 |journal =Diamond and Related Materials |volume =12| year =2003| pages= 1300–1306 |issue =8 |last1 =Ahmed |first1 =W. |last2 =Sein |first2 =H. |last3 =Ali |first3 =N. |last4 =Gracio |first4 =J. |last5 =Woodwards |first5 =R.|bibcode = 2003DRM....12.1300A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermal conductor ===
Most materials with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond is used as a [[heat sink]] for high-power [[laser diode]]s, laser arrays and high-power [[transistor]]s. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=120 W CW output power from monolithic AlGaAs (800 nm) laser diode array mounted on diamond heatsink |author1=Sakamoto, M. |author2=Endriz, J.

=== Optical material ===
Diamond is hard, chemically inert, and has high thermal conductivity and a low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace [[zinc selenide]] as the output window of high-power CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lasers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages = 303–334| title = Materials for infrared windows and domes: properties and performance| author = Harris, D.

Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10&amp;nbsp;cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The diamond window for a milli-wave zone high power electromagnetic wave output| journal = New Diamond| volume = 15|page = 27|year =1999|issn=1340-4792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Nusinovich, G.

Since these elements contain one more or one less [[valence electron]] than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] or [[n-type semiconductor]].

Synthetic diamond is already used as [[semiconductor detector|radiation detection device]]. It is [[radiation hardening|radiation hard]] and has a wide [[bandgap]] of 5.5 [[electron volt|eV]] (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors by the lack of a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult to fabricate surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation to gain access to the active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the [[BaBar]] detector at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator]]&lt;ref name=&quot;radiation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bucciolini, M. |title=Diamond dosimetry: Outcomes of the CANDIDO and CONRADINFN projects|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2005.06.030|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods A|volume=552|year=2005|pages=189–196|last2=Borchi|first2=E|last3=Bruzzi|first3=M|last4=Casati|first4=M|last5=Cirrone|first5=P|last6=Cuttone|first6=G|last7=Deangelis|first7=C|last8=Lovik|first8=I|last9=Onori|first9=S|bibcode = 2005NIMPA.552..189B |last10=Raffaele |first10=L. |last11=Sciortino |first11=S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for [[Ultraviolet|VUV]] solar observations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bold.oma.be/ |title=Blind to the Optical Light Detectors|publisher=Royal Observatory of Belgium| accessdate= May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= New developments on diamond photodetector for VUV Solar Observations| journal=Semiconductor Science and Technology |volume=23|page=035026|year=2008|doi=10.1088/0268-1242/23/3/035026| issue=3|last1= Benmoussa|first1= A|last2= Soltani|first2= A|last3= Haenen|first3= K|last4= Kroth|first4= U|last5= Mortet|first5= V|last6= Barkad|first6= H A|last7= Bolsee|first7= D|last8= Hermans|first8= C|last9= Richter|first9= M|bibcode = 2008SeScT..23c5026B |last10= De Jaeger|first10= J C|last11= Hochedez|first11= J F}}&lt;/ref&gt; A diamond VUV detector recently was used in the European [[LYRA]] program.
