The '''forest raven''' (''Corvus tasmanicus'', also commonly known as the '''Tasmanian raven''') is a [[passerine]] bird in the family [[Corvidae]] native to Tasmania and parts of southern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], such as [[Wilsons Promontory]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]]. Populations are also found in parts of [[New South Wales]], including [[Dorrigo, New South Wales|Dorrigo]] and [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]]. Measuring {{convert|50|–|53|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and legs. As with the other two species of raven in [[Australia]], its black feathers have grey bases. Adults have white [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]es; younger birds have dark brown and then hazel irises with an inner blue rim. New South Wales populations are recognised as a separate subspecies ''C. tasmanicus boreus'', but appear to be nested within the Tasmanian subspecies genetically.

The forest raven lives in a wide variety of habitats in Tasmania but is restricted to more closed forest on mainland Australia. Breeding takes place in spring and summer, occurring later in Tasmania than in New South Wales. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree. An [[omnivore|omnivorous]] and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas and roadkill. It has been blamed for killing lambs and poultry and raiding orchards in Tasmania, and is unprotected under Tasmanian legislation. The forest raven is sedentary, with pairs generally bonding for life and establishing permanent territories.

==Taxonomy and naming==
[[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] described the &quot;South-Seas raven&quot; in 1781, with loose throat feathers and found in &quot;the Friendly Isles&quot; in the South Seas, but did not give a binomial name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latham|first=John|title=A General Synopsis of Birds|publisher= Benj. White|location=London, United Kingdom|date=1781|volume=1|pages=369|url=http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33727899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although &quot;the Friendly Isles&quot; refers to Tonga,&lt;ref name=&quot;rowley 1970&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowley|first=Ian|date=1970|title=The Genus ''Corvus'' (Aves: Corvidae) in Australia|journal=CSIRO Wildlife Research|volume=15|issue=1|pages=27–71|doi=10.1071/CWR9700027}}&lt;/ref&gt; the specimen resembles what is now known as the forest raven and was collected by ships' surgeon [[William Anderson (naturalist)|William Anderson]] on the [[third voyage of James Cook]] in January 1777. Tasked as the expedition's naturalist, Anderson collected many bird specimens but had died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1778 before the return home. Many collection localities were incorrect, and notes were lost or pieced together many years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stresemann 1950&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stresemann|first=Erwin|date=1950 |title=Birds collected during Capt.

Since Australia was settled by Europeans, all species of crows and ravens have been colloquially known as crows by the general population and are difficult to distinguish.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowley 1970&quot;/&gt; In his 1865 ''[[Handbook to the Birds of Australia]]'', [[John Gould]] noted a single species of corvid in Australia, ''Corvus australis'', which he called the white-eyed crow. He used Gmelin's 1788 name, which took precedence by virtue of its age over Vigors and Horsfield's description.&lt;ref name=&quot;gould 1865&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=John|title=Handbook to The birds of Australia|publisher=self|location=London, United Kingdom|date=1865|pages=475 |url=http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/8460042}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 Scottish naturalist [[William Robert Ogilvie-Grant]] clarified the species as ''C. coronoides'' (raven, and incorporating [[little raven|little]] and [[Australian raven]]s) and ''C. cecilae'' ([[Torresian crow]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ogilvie-Grant|first=William Robert|date=1912|title=The Crows of Australia|journal=Emu|volume=12|issue=1|pages=44–45|doi=10.1071/MU912044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, French-American ornithologist [[Charles Vaurie]] acted as [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature#Principle of the First Reviser|First Revisor]] under Article 24 of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) Code and discarded ''C. australis'' as a junior homonym—in 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the [[black nunbird]]—to preserve the stability of the name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vaurie62&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaurie|first=Charles|title=Check-list of Birds of the World|editor=Mayr, Ernst|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=1962|edition=XV|pages=261|url=http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/14485649}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been followed by later authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Directory of Australian Birds: Passerines |first1=Richard |last1=Schodde |first2=I.

[[Gregory Mathews]] described the forest raven as a distinct subspecies—''Corvus marianae tasmanicus''—of the Australian raven in 1912,{{efn|1=Mathews used the binomial name ''Corvus marianae'' for the Australian raven}} its species name derived from Tasmania, the type locality.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=717}} Rowley raised the forest raven to species rank in 1970, noting there were no intermediate forms between it and the little raven (its closest relative) and that it was clearly larger with a much more massive bill. He described a second subspecies—''Corvus tasmanicus boreus''—the same year, observing that ''C. tasmanicus'' from Tasmania and southern Victoria has a very short tail compared with individuals from the northern New South Wales population.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowley 1970&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous two sentences --&gt; Rowley gave the species name forest raven in 1970. The term &quot;crow&quot; is colloquially applied to any or all species of Australian corvid.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowley 1970&quot;/&gt;

Preliminary genetic analysis of the genus using [[mitochondrial DNA]] showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another, and that the two lineages are not closely related. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the forest raven may be [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] with the Australian raven.&lt;ref name=haring2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Haring | first1 = Elisabeth | last2 = Däubl |first2=Barbara  | last3 = Pinsker| first3 = Wilhelm  | last4 = Kryukov | first4 = Alexey |last5=Gamauf | first5 = Anita | title = Genetic divergences and intraspeciﬁc variation in corvids of the genus ''Corvus'' (Aves: Passeriformes: Corvidae) – a ﬁrst survey based on museum specimens | journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0469.2012.00664.x | url = http://www.biosoil.ru/files/00010833.pdf | pages=230–46 | volume = 50 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 clarified that the forest and little raven are each other's closest relative.

Ian Rowley proposed that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north. The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens in the east and Australian raven in the west. As the climate was cooler and dryer, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely as the habitat between became inhospitable. Furthermore, the eastern diverged into nomadic little ravens and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western ravens spread eastwards and outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia, as evidenced by the forest raven being only found in closed forest refuges on the mainland but in a wider variety of habitats in Tasmania.&lt;ref name=rowley1973f&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/CWR9730157 | title=The Comparative Ecology of Australian Corvids.

==Description==
[[File:Corvus tasmanicus-01.JPG|thumb|left|Plumage showing glossy sheen in sunlight – [[Mole Creek, Tasmania]]|alt=black bird in a tree]]
The largest of the Australian corvids, the adult forest raven is {{convert|50|–|53|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length with a wingspan between {{convert|91|-|113|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weight of approximately {{convert|650|g|lb|abbr=on}}. There is no seasonal variation in plumage, which is entirely glossy black with a blue or green sheen visible on the upperparts.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=717}}  The wings are long and broad, with the largest of its ten primary feathers (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped. It is quite short in Tasmanian populations but longer in northern New South Wales. The beak is a similar shape to that of the little raven, though more massive and heavy-set. The upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=727}}&lt;!-- cites previous four sentences --&gt; The mouth and tongue are black, as are the powerful legs and feet. The [[Tibiotarsus|tibia]] is fully feathered and the [[Tarsometatarsus|tarsus]] is long.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=726}}

Sexes have identical plumage; the male is generally larger, but there is considerable overlap in size between individuals.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=717}} The forest raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=692}}&lt;!-- cites previous 3 sentences --&gt; The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=693}}&lt;!-- cites previous two sentences --&gt; Relative size is only useful when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=694}} In Tasmania, the forest raven could be confused with the [[black currawong]], though the latter species has more slender wings with white markings, a longer tail and a very different call.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=718}}

Juveniles (birds up to a year old) have a shorter, shallower bill, which is dark grey with some pink at the base. The [[Beak#Gape|gape]] is pink. The plumage is softer and fluffier and often has a brown tint. It generally lacks the glossy sheen of adult birds, though a blue-purple sheen can be seen sometimes on mantle and shoulders plumage. Birds between one and two years old closely resemble adults but retain juvenile feathers on wings and tail and have smaller bills.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=717}} Birds between two and three years have adult plumage but lack the adult eye colour.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=718}} Eye colour varies with age: nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey eyes, juveniles aged from four to fourteen months have brown eyes, and immature birds have hazel eyes with blue eyerings around the pupil until age two years and ten months.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowley 1970&quot;/&gt;{{efn|1=Rowley and colleagues recorded iris colour changes of all five Australian corvid species raised in captivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowley 1970&quot;/&gt;}}

===Vocalization===
[[File:Forest Raven Call.ogg|thumb|Forest raven vocalization]]
The [[Bird vocalization|call]] is considered the most reliable means of identification in areas where the forest raven's range overlaps with other corvids. It is a deep and husky ''&quot;korr-korr-korr-korr&quot;'' with a similarly drawn out last note to the Australian raven. It can also utter a barking [[alarm call]]. The calls of juveniles have a higher pitch than those of adult birds. Mated pairs greet each other with a specific return-home call; a long extended descending call, and characteristic flapping flight with reduced-amplitude wingbeats.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=724}}&lt;!-- cites previous four sentences --&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Corvus tasmanicus-04.JPG|thumb|right|A forest raven perching in a [[wood pasture]] within [[Rocky Cape National Park]], Tasmania, Australia|alt=A black bird perching on a large stump in a field]]
The only member of the [[Corvidae|corvid]] family that has a permanent population in [[Tasmania]],&lt;ref name=Thomas2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=R|last2=Thomas|first2=S|last3=Andrew|first3=D|last4=McBride|first4=A|editor-last=Storer|editor-first=P|title=The complete guide to finding the birds of Australia|edition=2nd|chapter=|pages=370|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria, Australia|year=2011|isbn=9780643097858|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zay4a9AoN3IC&amp;q=tasmanicus#v=onepage&amp;q=Corvus%20tasmanicus&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; the forest raven is the most widely distributed bird species in the state.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=719}} There are three populations in southern Victoria: from the vicinity of [[Lakes Entrance, Victoria|Lakes Entrance]] west across [[Gippsland]] to [[Wilsons Promontory]], the [[Great Otway National Park|Otway Ranges]] from {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Torquay, Victoria|Torquay]] to [[Port Campbell]], and lastly in the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]] and Millicent Plain extending into south-east South Australia. Isolated records suggest the latter two populations may actually be continuous.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=719}}&lt;!-- cites previous two sentences --&gt; There are two disjunct populations in northern New South Wales. A coastal population is found from [[Tea Gardens, New South Wales|Tea Gardens]] north to [[Yuraygir National Park]], while a more montane population is found along the [[Great Dividing Range]] and [[New England (New South Wales)|New England Tableland]] from [[Tenterfield, New South Wales|Tenterfield]] and [[Glen Innes, New South Wales|Glen Innes]] in the north to [[Gloucester Tops]] in the south. The gap between the two populations is around {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}}, shrinking to {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} at [[Dorrigo, New South Wales|Dorrigo]].{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=719}}

The forest raven inhabits a wide range of habitat within Tasmania such as woods, open interrupted forest, mountains, coastal areas, farmland and town and city fringes.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=718}} A survey of [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]] found it to be one of the few birds that remained in open and marshland habitat at higher elevations over the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratkowsky |first=A.V.|author2=Ratkowsky , D.A.|date=1978|title=A survey of the birds of the Mt Wellington Range, Tasmania, during the non-breeding months|journal=Emu|volume=78|issue=4|pages=223–26|doi=10.1071/MU9780223}}&lt;/ref&gt; On mainland Australia it appears to be more confined to forests: wet and dry [[sclerophyll]] forest and cool [[temperate rainforest]], as well as pine plantations in Victoria.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=718}} Populations in Victoria and New South Wales are possibly expanding,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=718}} with the species more evident in towns such as [[Forster, New South Wales|Forster-Tuncurry]] and [[Port Macquarie]],{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=719}} and along segments of the [[Oxley Highway]] between [[Wauchope, New South Wales|Wauchope]] and [[Walcha, New South Wales|Walcha]], and [[Thunderbolts Way]] between [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]] and [[Nowendoc, New South Wales|Nowendoc]], most likely due to roadkill from increased vehicular traffic.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=720}} It is unclear whether records since the 1970s in areas where the forest raven was unknown are the result of range expansion or improved field observations and identification.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=720}}

Forest ravens fly from Tasmania and the mainland to islands well offshore in [[Bass Strait]] and may even traverse the strait entirely. First recorded on [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]] in Bass Strait in 1979, the forest raven has become more numerous and flocks of several hundred birds were recorded by 1997. The island was previously inhabited by little ravens.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=720}}&lt;!-- cites previous 3 sentences --&gt;

===Conservation===
Its large range and abundance means the bird is classified as ''Least Concern'' on the [[IUCN Red List]]; some decrease has been noted but it is of insufficient size or duration to change classification.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; The populations of northern New South Wales have been classified as ''Near Threatened'' in 2000 by Garnett and Crowley and were estimated at the time to number about 10,000 breeding pairs.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=720}}

==Behaviour==
Sedentary and territorial, the forest raven is similar in breeding and feeding habits to the Australian raven.&lt;ref name=debus2006/&gt; A single breeding pair and their brood occupy a territory of variable size—areas of {{convert|40|to|400|ha|acre|abbr=on}} have been recorded—and remains there year-round, though groups of ravens may enter this area to forage. In northern New South Wales, forest ravens have been recorded nesting near Australian ravens and [[Torresian crow]]s. They were observed warding off the Australian ravens but to a degree permitting the crows to pass through their territories.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=723}}&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt; Forest ravens will defend their territory by chasing and [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]] intruding birds of prey as large as [[wedge-tailed eagle]]s and [[white-bellied sea eagle]]s. Agonistic displays to ward off potential intruders include flying to a high perch and calling loudly with head extended and hackles raised. Forest ravens will give their wings a flick on the upward wingbeat when flying to the perch and may continue flicking their wings after landing.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=724}}&lt;!-- cites previous three sentences --&gt; Subadult and nonbreeding forest ravens form flocks that move around, though they may use the same roosting site for a few months at a time.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=723}} Forest ravens generally walk when moving around on the ground, though do hop when hurrying, such as when trying to avoid an oncoming car on a road.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=718}}

===Feeding===
The forest raven is an [[omnivore]], though it eats more meat than smaller corvids.&lt;ref name=rowley1973e&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/CWR9730131 | title=The Comparative Ecology of Australian Corvids.

It has been known to attack and eat birds as large as the [[little penguin]], though many birds and mammals are already dead when encountered.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=722}} In general, a significant proportion of its food appears to come from habitats in or near water.&lt;ref name=debus2006&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Debus, S.J.S. |author2=Rose, A.B. | title=Supplementary Data on Breeding and Diet of the Northern Forest Raven ''Corvus tasmanicus Boreus'' | journal = Australian Field Ornithology | year= 2006 | volume=23|issue=2 |pages=96–101 | issn=1448-0107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest ravens observed on the beach at Wilson's Promontory would glean the sand and turn over or disturb pieces of seaweed and debris for insect prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitzsimons|first=James |date=2003|title=Beach-foraging behaviour of Forest Ravens Corvus tasmanicus and an Australian Magpie Gymnorhina tibicen at Wilsons Promontory, Victoria |journal=Australian Field Ornithology|volume=20|issue=1|pages=24–27|issn=1448-0107|url=http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30001872/fitzsimons-beachforaging-2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been reported taking crabs from sandbars and raiding seabird colonies for eggs and young.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=721}}

Forest ravens forage in pairs or groups of up to ten birds, though they may gather in much larger numbers if there is an abundant food source, such as a large carcass, rubbish or insect swarm.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=721}} The species is attracted to areas where people have discarded excess food, such as rubbish tips, picnic grounds, parks, gardens and roads.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=719}} Forest ravens sometimes forage in [[mixed-species foraging flock|mixed-species flocks]] with Torresian crows, little and Australian ravens. In these situations, the more abundant species may exclude the less abundant. In Tasmania, forest ravens have been recorded foraging with [[Pacific gull|Pacific]] and [[silver gull]]s, and black currawongs.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=721}} Foraging takes place in the early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=722}} Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while walking along and looking, and turning over objects with their bills as they go.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=721}} Forest ravens often fly {{convert|1|–|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground over marshland, heath or beaches looking for food.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=718}} Nests of various birds, including domestic chickens and burrowing seabirds have been raided for eggs and young.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=721}} Forest ravens have been observed attempting to raid the nest of ospreys on the New South Wales north coast.&lt;ref name=debus2006/&gt;

Forest ravens cache food items for later consumption, generally using trees to evade other scavengers. Field observations in Nambucca showed that they built stick-like platforms {{convert|30|–|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter high in the canopies of trees as places to store and eat food. They were recorded storing food in tree forks {{convert|10|–|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground and within the folds of the bark of paperbark trees. In another field study, a forest raven stole a cape barren goose egg and hid it in a grassy tussock to consume later.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=722}}&lt;!-- cites para --&gt;

Alongside Australian ravens, forest ravens have been blamed for damaging orchards and killing lambs and poultry. This is not supported by fieldwork.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=720}}&lt;!-- cite previous two sentences --&gt; They most often scavenge for afterbirth and newborn lamb faeces, which are highly nutritious.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=722}} They are thought to have a beneficial role in cleaning up carcasses and consuming insect pests.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=722}}  Forest ravens prey on the larvae of the pasture beetle ''[[Scitala sericans]]''. The beetle can damage pastures and is an agricultural pest; the raven may uproot plants when digging out the grubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1440-6055.1976.tb01726.x |journal=Australian Journal of Entomology |volume = 15|issue=4| pages= 433–40 |year=1977 |title=The Biology And Behaviour Of The Pasture Beetle ''Scitala Sericans'' Erichson (Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae) |author=Hardy, R.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breeding===
Forest ravens breed after at least three years, and form monogamous pairs.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=723}} Birds breed later in Tasmania than mainland Australia, though the species has been little-studied. Eggs have been recorded from July to September and nestlings in September and October in New South Wales,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=724}} while nestlings have been noted from September to December in Victoria. In Tasmania, the breeding season appears to take place from August to January.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=725}} Forest ravens generally nest in forks in tall trees, usually eucalypts, below the canopy line. They have been recorded nesting on the ground on some Bass Strait Islands.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=725}} Breeding success rates were impacted severely by droughts in New South Wales.&lt;ref name=debus2006/&gt;

The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of twigs lined with available materials such as leaves, wool, grass, bark, feathers, or occasionally horse manure or hair from cattle. The sticks are generally {{convert|4|-|14|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. Nests are sometimes renovated from previous years.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=725}}&lt;!-- cites previous 3 sentences --&gt; A clutch can comprise up to six eggs, though usually four or five are laid. Measuring 45 by 31&amp;nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|3|4}} × {{frac|1|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in), eggs are green-cream and splotched with brown and grey markings. Eggs are laid every one to two days.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=725}}&lt;!-- cites previous 3 sentences --&gt;  Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified.&lt;ref name=rowley1973d&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1071/CWR9730091 | title=The Comparative Ecology of Australian Corvids. IV. Nesting and the rearing of young to independence | author= Rowley, Ian |   journal =CSIRO Wildlife Research |volume= 18|issue=1 |pages= 91–129 |year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avian incubation|Incubation]] of the eggs is done solely by the female. The chicks are [[altricial]] and [[nidicolous]]; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. Both parents feed the young.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=725}}&lt;!-- cites previous 2 sentences --&gt;

===Parasites===
The mite ''[[Knemidocoptes intermedius]]'' has been isolated from the forest raven. Infestation results in crusty (hyperkeratotic) grey lesions around their tibiotarsal joints, the mites living in tunnels under the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=R.W.|author2=Fain, A.|date=1988|title=''Knemidocoptes intermedius'' identified in forest ravens (''Corvus tasmanicus'')|journal=Australian Veterinary Journal|volume=65|issue=8|pages=260|doi=10.1111/j.1751-0813.1988.tb14316.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[channel-billed cuckoo]] (''Scythrops novaehollandiae'') has been recorded as a [[brood parasite]].{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=725}}

Like the Australian raven on mainland Australia, the Forest raven in Tasmania has a history of being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers as it is perceived to be a threat to livestock and orchard crops.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=720}}  It is not protected under Tasmania's Nature Conservation Act 2002 and no permit is required if landowners seek to kill them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/wildlife-management/management-of-wildlife/managing-wildlife-browsing-grazing-losses/permits-and-regulations|title=Permits and Regulations|last=Wildlife Management Branch|date=2010|work=Wildlife Management|publisher=Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (Tasmania)|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger numbers of forest ravens (alongside swamp harriers and brown falcons) were killed in 1958 as rabbit populations dwindled due to myxomatosis and predatory birds were thought to have turned their attention to poultry and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharland|first=Michael|date=1958|title=Branch reports:Tasmania|journal=Emu|volume=58|issue=1|pages=42–53 [43–44]|doi=10.1071/MU958042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on corvids elsewhere in Australia showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked, and hence their poor reputation was unjustified.&lt;ref name=rowley69&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rowley |first=Ian |year=1969|title=An evaluation of predation by 'crows' on young lambs |journal=CSIRO Wildlife Research |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=153–79 |doi=10.1071/CWR9690153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest ravens may do more good than harm by preying on insects and removing carrion. Despite their fondness for roadkill, forest ravens are rarely hit by vehicles.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=720}}&lt;!-- cites previous two sentences --&gt;
