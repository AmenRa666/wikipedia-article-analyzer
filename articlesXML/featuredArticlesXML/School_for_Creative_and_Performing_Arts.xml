The '''School for Creative and Performing Arts''' ('''SCPA''') is a [[magnet school|magnet]] arts school in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]], and part of the [[Cincinnati Public Schools]] (CPS). SCPA was founded in 1973 as one of the first magnet schools in Cincinnati and became the first school in the country to combine a full range of arts studies with a complete [[University-preparatory school|college-preparatory]] academic program for elementary through high school students. Of the approximately 350 arts schools in the United States, SCPA is one of the oldest and has been cited as a model for both [[racial integration]] and for arts programs in over 100 cities.{{sfn|Vaccariello|Pyle|1993|p=103|loc=&quot;... in the surprisingly well-populated world of art schools (there are over 350 of them) SCPA is one of the oldest and most prestigious&quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;case for arts schools&quot; /&gt;

SCPA had three different homes in its first four years, including a makeshift campus in the [[Mount Adams, Cincinnati|Mount Adams]] neighborhood and another in [[Roselawn, Cincinnati|Roselawn]]. In 1976, it occupied the Old [[Woodward High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Woodward High School]] building, on the site of one of the oldest public schools in the country. The school rose to national prominence in the 1980s, but was nearly closed in the 1990s following a series of scandals, leadership struggles, and an arson fire which destroyed the auditorium. Its reputation recovered in the years that followed and in 2009–10, the school was featured in the [[MTV]] reality series ''[[Taking the Stage]]'', filmed at the school and featuring SCPA students. In 2010 SCPA combined with the Schiel Primary School for Arts Enrichment to create the first [[kindergarten]] through [[twelfth grade]] (about ages five to seventeen) arts school and first private sector/public arts school in the US. A new facility in [[Over-the-Rhine]] was championed by the late [[Cincinnati Pops]] [[Maestro]] [[Erich Kunzel]] and funded through a unique public-private partnership that raised over $31&amp;nbsp;million in private contributions to match public funding. The building features specialized facilities for the arts and three separate theaters and is the key to redevelopment plans for the area.

Students must audition for admission; fewer than 20&amp;nbsp;percent of those who apply each year are accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed to prepare students for professional careers in [[creative writing]], [[dance]], [[drama]], [[music]], [[Stagecraft|technical theater]], and [[visual arts|visual art]]. The emphasis is on performance, and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On [[standardized test]]s, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates in a wide range of artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.

=== Background ===

[[File:Waldrip Dickinson.jpg|thumb|alt=Two men in winter coats and hats standing in crowd in front of tall city buildings |Bill Dickinson (left), who led the school from its founding in 1973 until 1991, and CPS Superintendent Dr. Donald Waldrip at an All-City Boy Choir performance on Cincinnati's [[Fountain Square, Cincinnati|Fountain Square]], c. 1974]]
The School for Creative and Performing Arts arose, in part, as a response to the recurring [[desegregation]] battles in the [[Cincinnati Public Schools]] (CPS) in the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Waldrip|1976|p=41}} In a 1965 civil rights suit, the city prevailed when a federal judge found that the schools were not intentionally segregated, but that &quot;the racial composition of each school is simply a result of the racial composition of the neighborhoods which they serve&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = [[Deal v. Cincinnati Board of Education]] |vol = 244 |reporter = F. Supp. 572 |court = Dist. Court S. D. Ohio | year = 1965 |pinpoint = 580 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1768651766411810675&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971, Cincinnati's neighborhoods and schools had grown more segregated and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld [[forced busing]] as a remedy for school segregation in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants = Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.| vol = 402 | reporter = U.S. 1 | year = 1971 | court = Supreme Court | url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=402&amp;invol=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Desiring to avoid such drastic remedies for Cincinnati, newly appointed Superintendent Dr. Donald Waldrip pushed forward a program of [[Magnet school|alternative schools]] (later called magnet schools), designed &quot;to calm the desires of parents for academic choice and to stem the demands of federal judges for court-ordered desegregation.&quot;{{sfn|Waldrip|1976|p=41}} The theory behind alternative schools was [[school choice|open enrollment]]: students could attend any alternative school they chose at no cost, so long as an even racial balance at the new school was maintained.{{sfn|Griffin|1977|p=87}} So far as possible, students were admitted to these programs on a one white for one black basis.{{sfn|Jacobs &amp; Felix|1977|p=110}} The School for Creative and Performing Arts was the first alternative school in what would become one of the largest and most robust magnet programs in the country.{{sfn|Griffin|1977|p=85}}{{cref |a}}

In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music teachers in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for the boys in the choir carried over into their academic studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;artsschool&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Stein | first = Jerry| title = The Arts School | newspaper= [[The Cincinnati Post]] | date = November 27, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents.&lt;ref name=&quot;writingthebook&quot; /&gt; With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the [[Baldwin Piano Company]], which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;writingthebook&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Eliot | first = John | title = Mt. Adams School: They're Writing the 'Book' for Alternative Education | newspaper= The Cincinnati Post | date = October 24, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Dwight Hamilton Baldwin (1821–1899) and the Baldwin Piano | last = Wulsin | first = Lucien | location = New York | publisher = Newcomen Society in North America | page = 18 | oclc = 963911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The School for Creative and Performing Arts opened in August 1973, as the only [[fourth grade|grade four]] through [[sixth grade|six]] school for the performing arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program.&lt;ref name=&quot;writingthebook&quot; /&gt;{{cref |b}} The curriculum included art, [[instrumental]] music, [[choir|choral music]], dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Fourteen Year Old Dream for the Talented Comes True | journal = Gifted Child Quarterly | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | page = 108 | year = 1974 | issn = 0016-9862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray explained: &lt;blockquote&gt;Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.&lt;ref name=&quot;opens&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Alternative School For Arts Opens On Mt. Adams | last = Gardner | first = Jani | newspaper= [[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] | date = August 30, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Founding in Mount Adams (1973–1975) ===
[[File:MtAdamsPublicSchool.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A small brick and stone building, seen from the corner view, in front of clear blue sky|Mount Adams Public School, the first home of SCPA. The [[Romanesque Revival]] school house, built by Henry Siter in 1894, was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Mount Adams Public School | work = National Register of Historic Places | date = November 24, 1980 | publisher = National Park Service | url =http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/ | accessdate = May 19, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;]]Dickinson was named coordinator and six weeks later he, McSpadden, Murray and others had selected a staff, developed a program, recruited students, and moved into the [[Mount Adams Public School]] building at 1125 St. Gregory Street.{{sfn|Waldrip|1979|p=132}} Described by ''[[Cincinnati Magazine]]'' as &quot;a quaint village of imaginative, arty residents, unusual shops and restaurants, and historic buildings&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;queencity&quot;&gt;{{cite news| page = 9 | newspaper = [[Cincinnati Magazine]] | volume = 9 | number = 5 |date = February 1976| title = Queen City History}}&lt;/ref&gt; and overlooking downtown Cincinnati and the [[Ohio River]], [[Mount Adams, Cincinnati|Mount Adams]] had been home to the [[Art Academy of Cincinnati]] (the museum school of the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]]) since 1887, and was a &quot;mecca for students and teachers of art&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;queencity&quot; /&gt; The Mount Adams School was nearly defunct, with fewer than 80 students remaining. Fifty of those children, ranging from [[kindergarten]] (around age five) to [[third grade]] (around age eight) remained alongside the new SCPA. A dozen of the Mount Adams [[middle school]] students were accepted into the new program, along with the 140 other fourth through sixth grade pupils selected from schools around the city by audition.

By 1974, SCPA had 332 students, with 500 on the waiting list, and had overflowed into rented space in the surrounding neighborhood, including three rooms at the nearby Holy Cross School, two rooms at the community center two blocks away, and large room for drama above Mike's Meat Market across the street. Students practiced instruments in hallways and restrooms, and the library was in the middle of the second floor hall. Student productions were held in other schools around the city, and the first major musical, [[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|''Babes in Toyland'']], was performed at Education Center downtown.{{sfn|Waldrip|1979|p=132}} With plans to expand to [[ninth grade]] (around age 14) and 540 students in 1975, and to [[twelfth grade]] (around age 17) and 1,400 students in 1977, a new facility had to be found.&lt;ref name=&quot;plannedgrowth&quot; /&gt; Waldrip proposed the school move to the Old Woodward school building, then home of Abigail Cutter [[Junior High School]], in [[Over-the-Rhine]], a predominantly African-American area near downtown. Neighborhood resistance was strong and opponents, arguing that &quot;the school administration was trying to avoid problems of integration by moving an alternative school to Cutter and transferring Cutter students elsewhere&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;bursting&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Brookshire | first = Kay | title = Mt. Adams School Bursting at the Seams | newspaper= The Cincinnati Post | date = February 6, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; blocked the plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;plannedgrowth&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Planned Growth of Arts School Hinges on Site | newspaper = The Cincinnati Post | last = Brookshire | first = Kay | date = April 7, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Councilwoman Bobbie Stern proposed the school move to [[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal|Cincinnati Union Terminal]], a [[National Historic Landmark]] which the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] called &quot;a unique and monumental manifestation of [[Art Deco]] architecture and interior decoration&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Cincinnati Union Terminal | series = Historic American Buildings Survey (Library of Congress) | publisher = National Park Service | url = http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.oh0024 | accessdate = May 17, 2010 | pages = 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted for its mosaic murals depicting the history of Cincinnati and its [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], {{convert|106|ft|m}} high and {{convert|110|ft|m}} long, the largest [[semi-dome]] in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The Girls Town Proposal Has Possibilities | newspaper = The Cincinnati Enquirer | date = April 8, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1257&amp;ResourceType=Building | title = Cincinnati Union Terminal | date = May 5, 1977 |work=National Historic Landmark summary listing |publisher=National Park Service | accessdate = May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility, vacant since it was abandoned by [[Amtrak]] in 1972, was to house the school, a maintenance facility for the [[Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority|Queen City Metro]] transit service, and a new rail terminal for Amtrak. The plan was approved in April 1975 and was due for completion for the 1976 school year.&lt;ref name=&quot;urgemoving&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Waldrip to Urge Moving Mt. Adams School Next Year | newspaper = The Cincinnati Enquirer | date = May 8, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transition in Roselawn (1975–1976) ===
Temporary space was needed in the interim, and the school relocated its 550 fourth through ninth grade students to rented space in [[Roselawn, Cincinnati|Roselawn]], the epicenter of Cincinnati's Jewish Community.{{sfn|Fine|Krome|2007|p=8}}&lt;ref name=&quot;crackingbooks&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Brookshire| first = Kay| title = They're Cracking Books at Art School | newspaper= The Cincinnati Post | date = December 5, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was divided between two buildings, the [[Yavneh Day School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Yavneh Day School]] building at 1636 Summit Road and the nearby Jewish Community Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockdale&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Rockdale Temple to House School for Creative Arts | newspaper = The Cincinnati Post | date = December 20, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yavneh Day school, founded in 1952 by parents who wanted to combine secular and Jewish education for their children, moved to Roselawn in 1958 but had outgrown that facility.{{sfn|Fine|Krome|2007|p=115}} The school had no lockers; students carried their belongings between buildings.{{cref|c}} Lunches were delivered from another school and served at a nearby church.&lt;ref name=&quot;crackingbooks&quot; /&gt;

Dickinson became principal in 1975, and worked to fully integrate the arts into the academic program. &quot;Academics don't end when art, drama or music classes begin,&quot; he said, &quot;but blend, in an interdisciplinary approach to education.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;crackingbooks&quot; /&gt; Music study included acoustics and the history and architecture of important musical periods; art history was part of the art curriculum and anatomy and physiology were studied in the dance program.&lt;ref name=&quot;crackingbooks&quot; /&gt; The school was recognized with ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'s'' Corbett Award in 1976 as &quot;the arts organization making an outstanding contribution to the community&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;artsschool&quot; /&gt;

The Union Terminal project was derailed when the three prospective tenants failed to agree on how to share the space. Having outgrown its temporary facilities, SCPA was again forced to find a new home for the following year. After examining options including the historic [[Rockdale Temple]] and two schools slated to be closed in the city's [[West End, Cincinnati|West End]], the school board once again settled on the Old Woodward building, over the objections of the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockdale&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = West End School Closings to be Discussed | last = Brookshire | first = Kay | newspaper = The Cincinnati Post | date = November 22, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Old Woodward and national attention (1976–1990) ===

The [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] building is part of the Over-the-Rhine National Register Historic District.]]
SCPA's new home was in the heart of [[Pendleton, Cincinnati|Pendleton]] district in Over-the-Rhine.

''[[Taking the Stage]]'', a &quot;musical reality&quot; TV series set at SCPA, premiered on [[MTV]] in March 2009. The series, co-created and co-produced by SCPA graduate [[Nick Lachey]], was a dramatized depiction of life at the school. The show chronicled the lives of five real SCPA high school students and their friends in their careers at SCPA. Each episode featured original music and choreography by the students themselves, performed at the school and other locations in Over-the-Rhine.&lt;ref name=&quot;scpalikes&quot; /&gt;

The first season, which premiered on March 19, 2009, was the number one primetime cable telecast among females 12–24 years old and one of the top four among all viewers 12–34 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =MTV Delivers Two of Cable’s Top 5 Primetime Telecasts Among P12-34: 'Making the Band' and 'Taking the Stage' | work = TV by the Numbers| url = http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/04/03/mtv-delivers-two-of-cables-top-5-primetime-telecasts-among-p12-34-making-the-band-and-taking-the-stage/15911 | accessdate = January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season began filming at the school in 2009, and first aired on January 16, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Taking the Stage – Season Two | work = MTV.com | url = http://www.mtv.com/shows/taking_the_stage/season_2/series.jhtml | accessdate = January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was cut from one hour to 30&amp;nbsp;minutes and focused on new transfer students instead of current SCPA students, leading some students and parents to complain that the admission process had been compromised.

== Admission ==
The school has been criticized as &quot;elitist&quot; for its selective admission policies.{{sfn|Cromwell &amp; North|1982|loc=9:02 &quot;It's not easy to get into this school. Everyone has to audition. So far this year, some 1,500 students have auditioned for the 200 spots opening up in the fall. Making youngsters audition has led some to charge that SCPA is elitist.&quot;}}  Prospective students are evaluated on their artistic sensitivity and potential.{{sfn|Cromwell &amp; North|1982|loc=10:15}} Students entering grades four through six are required to audition in every arts major; older students may audition in only the areas they choose.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scpa.cps-k12.org/about/faq.html |title=FAQ |publisher=The School for Creative and Performing Arts |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310084822/http://scpa.cps-k12.org/about/faq.html |archivedate=March 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each applicant performs in front of up to seven teachers in different areas in the day-long process, which is designed to ensure that no student is admitted to a program in which they do not belong.{{sfn|Cromwell &amp; North| 1982|loc=9:12 &quot;The reason, obviously, is so that some student does not come here and get hurt.

As a magnet school founded to promote school integration, racial and economic diversity have been important factors in admissions decisions.

The curriculum is designed to prepare students for professional careers in the arts. Each student concentrates in at least one major area: creative writing, dance, drama, music, [[technical theater|stagecraft]], and visual art. Younger students often concentrate in two or more. High school students are required to specialize and major only in the areas in which they have potential to do professional work.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scpa.cps-k12.org/about/factsheet.html |title=Fact Sheet |publisher=The School for Creative and Performing Arts |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414062003/http://scpa.cps-k12.org/about/factsheet.html |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced students study up to two hours each day in their major. Forty percent of the students stay at least two hours after school for rehearsals, private lessons, and productions.&lt;ref name=&quot;guide&quot; /&gt;

The program stresses discipline and performance. There are no appreciation courses; the curriculum emphasizes that arts appreciation grows from practicing an art.{{sfn|Borman|Spring|1984|p=128}} The interrelation of the arts is also stressed. All students take at least one course in each major area. A dancer, for example, will be required to study visual art, drama, and music.{{sfn|Borman|Spring|1984|p=129}}

The visual arts program includes drawing, painting, photography, sculpting, digital art, and art history. The program is highly structured, emphasizing technique and control over free expression, which has attracted criticism from the local art community.{{sfn|Borman|Spring|1984|p=129}} Art students receive individualized instruction, participate in art exhibits and competitions, undertake commissioned work, and work at in-house galleries and off-site exhibits. Most art majors take Advanced Placement art courses by the end of their sophomore year, and many attend pre-college programs at major universities between their high school years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual Arts – More Than Meets the Eye |publisher=School for Creative and Performing Arts |url=http://scpa.cps-k12.org/arts/visual-art.html |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505061520/http://scpa.cps-k12.org/arts/visual-art.html |archivedate=May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drama program stresses technique and performance; students must perform in public at least twice a year.{{sfn|Borman|Spring|1984|p=129}} There are three major dramatic productions each season, and high school students are required to compete in the [[English Speaking Union]] Shakespeare Contest.

The dance program was founded on the training principles of the &quot;most famous dance schools of Europe&quot;,{{sfn|Cromwell &amp; North | 1982|loc=4:21}} which emphasize body training. All dancers are required to study ballet, but may also learn modern dance, jazz, tap, and other forms of dance.{{sfn|Borman|Spring|1984|p=129}} There are nine levels of ballet, and students begin intensive training in fourth grade. Dance classes meet for at least two 45-minute periods every day; advanced students may train for three or more.

The instrumental music program offers specializations in orchestra, band, piano, jazz, percussion, and harp. Students major in an instrument and specialized training begins in grade four.

The technical theater program offers college-level training in [[stage management]], [[Lighting designer|lighting]], [[Sound design|sound]], and [[Scenic design|set]] and [[costume design]]. Each specialty has a lab for students to develop concepts and practice technique, and students work side-by-side with professional trades people in their chosen field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Theater – Building Strong Futures |publisher=School for Creative and Performing Arts |url=http://scpa.cps-k12.org/arts/technicaltheater.html |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422051731/http://scpa.cps-k12.org/arts/technicaltheater.html |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student present to the faculty of their major department twice a year in a &quot;proficiency review&quot; to assess their progress. It is a learning experience for younger students, but students in grades 7–12 who fail to attain a passing rating are placed on probation and must pass their subsequent review to be allowed to continue in that major. Students must audition if they wish to change majors for the following year.{{sfn|Student Handbook|2007|pp=21,25}}

=== Academics ===
Students are required to complete a standard CPS academic curriculum alongside their arts studies and the school day is 45&amp;nbsp;minutes longer than other Cincinnati public schools. SCPA ranks first in the district on standardized test scores at the elementary school level. At the high school level, only [[Walnut Hills High School]], Cincinnati's selective public college preparatory magnet, ranks higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Partnering Dance And Education: Intelligent Moves For Changing Times | page = 39 | last = Hanna | first = Judith Lynne | location = Champaign, IL | publisher = Human Kinetics | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-88011-511-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the graduation rate was 95.5&amp;nbsp;percent and the mean score on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], a standardized college admissions test, was 23 (at the 69th [[percentile]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School for Creative and Perf Arts High School |publisher=Ohio Department of Education |url=http://scpa.cps-k12.org/about/DownloadCenter/State_Report_Card/SCPAreport.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |page=6 |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729044318/http://scpa.cps-k12.org/about/DownloadCenter/State_Report_Card/SCPAreport.pdf |archivedate=July 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = ACT High School Profile Report | publisher = ACT | url = http://www.act.org/news/data/07/pdf/National2007.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = February 23, 2010 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Ohio Department of Education 2009–2010 School Year Report card, SCPA was designated &quot;Effective&quot; and Schiel was designated &quot;Excellent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reportcard2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Schiel Prim Schl Arts Enrchmnt Elementary School | publisher = Ohio Department of Education | url = http://www.ode.state.oh.us/reportcardfiles/2009-2010/BUILD/033712.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = September 22, 2010 | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city.

== Extracurricular activities ==
SCPA offers a limited range of sports and other activities compared to other CPS schools, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to practice and performance. Volunteer community service opportunities are organized by the Positive School Culture committee and made available to students in every grade. Student Council is elected from each grade and raises funds for student activities. [[National Honor Society]] (for grades ten to twelve) and [[National Junior Honor Society]] (for grades seven through nine) are by invitation only to students who demonstrate outstanding achievement, service, leadership, and citizenship.{{sfn|Student Handbook|2009|pp=28–29}}

German, French, and Spanish clubs are open to all students and plan language-related activities. The Astronomy Club for Girls for fourth through sixth graders takes advantage of the nearby [[Cincinnati Observatory]] to explore astronomy. The Brain Bowl team, also for fourth through sixth graders, participates in academic competitions. Students Involved in Fostering Tolerance (SIFT) works to promote tolerance and diversity through awareness field trips and fundraisers.{{sfn|Student Handbook|2009|pp=28–29}}

Student publications include the [[yearbook]], ''1310 Address of the Arts,'' a monthly newspaper published by the Creative Writing department, but open to contributions by all students, and ''Pandora's Backpages,'' a full-color magazine featuring creative writing, visual art and musical compositions by students, faculty, and alumni.{{sfn|Student Handbook|2009|pp=28–29}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Spotlight |url=http://scpa.cps-k12.org/about/award/inthespotlight.html |publisher=School for Creative and Performing Arts |accessdate=November 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201042228/http://scpa.cps-k12.org/about/award/inthespotlight.html |archivedate=February 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
