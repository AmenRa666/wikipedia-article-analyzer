'''''Helicobacter pylori''''', previously '''''Campylobacter pylori''''', is a [[gram-negative]], [[microaerophile|microaerophilic]] [[bacterium]] found usually in the [[stomach]]. It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists [[Barry Marshall]] and [[Robin Warren]], who found that it was present in a person with chronic [[gastritis]] and [[Peptic ulcer|gastric ulcers]], conditions not previously believed to have a [[Microorganism|microbial]] cause. It is also linked to the development of [[duodenum|duodenal]] ulcers and [[stomach cancer]]. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are [[asymptomatic]], and it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blaser MJ | title = Who are we?

''H. pylori'' possesses five major [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]] protein &lt;!-- (OMP) --&gt; families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusters2006&quot; /&gt; The largest family includes known and putative [[adhesins]]. The other four families are [[Porin (protein)|porin]]s, iron transporters, [[flagella|flagellum]]-associated proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Like other typical Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane of ''H. pylori'' consists of [[phospholipids]] and [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS). The [[O antigen]] of LPS may be [[fucose|fucosylated]] and mimic Lewis [[Blood type|blood group antigens]] found on the gastric epithelium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusters2006&quot;/&gt; The outer membrane also contains [[cholesterol]] glucosides, which are found in few other bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusters2006&quot;/&gt; ''H. pylori'' has four to six lophotrichous [[flagellum|flagella]]; all gastric and enterohepatic ''Helicobacter'' species are highly motile owing to flagella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Josenhans C, Eaton KA, Thevenot T, Suerbaum S | title = Switching of Flagellar Motility in ''Helicobacter pylori'' by Reversible Length Variation of a Short Homopolymeric Sequence Repeat in fliP, a Gene Encoding a Basal Body Protein | journal = Infect Immun | volume = 68 | issue = 8 | pages = 4598–603 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10899861 | pmc = 98385 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.68.8.4598-4603.2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic sheathed flagellar filaments of ''Helicobacter'' are composed of two copolymerized flagellins, FlaA and FlaB.&lt;ref name= Rustetal&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1-904455-31-X|chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/hpl2|vauthors=Rust M, Schweinitzer T, Josenhans C |year=2008|chapter=Helicobacter Flagella, Motility and Chemotaxis|title=''Helicobacter pylori'': Molecular Genetics and Cellular Biology|editor=Yamaoka Y|publisher=Caister Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microscopy===
''H. pylori'' can be demonstrated in tissue by Gram stain, Giemsa stain, haematoxylin–eosin stain, Warthin–Starry silver stain, acridine orange stain, and phase-contrast microscopy.

In 2010, Sharma ''et al''. presented a comprehensive analysis of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] at single-[[nucleotide]] resolution by differential [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]] which confirmed the known acid induction of major [[Virulence factor|virulence]] loci such as the [[urease]] (ure) operon or the cag pathogenicity island (see below).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sharma | first1 = C.

Until 2010, only about 55 transcriptional start sites (TSSs) were known in this species. Notably, 27% of the primary TSSs are also antisense TSSs, indicating that—similar to ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''—[[Antisense RNA|antisense transcription]] occurs across the entire ''H. pylori'' genome. At least one antisense TSS is associated with about 46% of all [[open reading frame]]s, including many [[housekeeping gene]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma2010&quot;/&gt; Most (about 50%) of the 5' [[Untranslated region|UTRs]] are 20–40 nucleotides (nt) in length and support the AAGGag motif located about 6 nt (median distance) upstream of start codons as the consensus [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence|Shine–Dalgarno sequence]] in ''H. pylori''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma2010&quot;/&gt;

====Genes involved in virulence and pathogenesis====
Study of the ''H. pylori'' genome is centered on attempts to understand [[pathogenesis]], the ability of this [[organism]] to cause disease. About 29% of the loci have a&amp;nbsp;colonization defect&amp;nbsp;when mutated. Two of sequenced strains have an around 40-[[Kilo-base pair|kb]]-long Cag [[pathogenicity island]] (a common [[Gene|gene sequence]] believed responsible for pathogenesis) that contains over 40 genes. This pathogenicity island is usually absent from ''H. pylori'' strains isolated from humans who are carriers of ''H. pylori'' but remain [[asymptomatic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Baldwin2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baldwin DN, Shepherd B, Kraemer P, Hall MK, Sycuro LK, Pinto-Santini DM, Salama NR | title = Identification of ''Helicobacter pylori'' Genes That Contribute to Stomach Colonization | journal = Infect Immun | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 1005–16 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17101654 | pmc = 1828534 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.01176-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[cagA]]'' gene codes for one of the major ''H. pylori'' [[virulence]] proteins. Bacterial strains with the ''cagA'' gene are associated with an ability to cause [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11283049&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broutet N, Marais A, Lamouliatte H, de Mascarel A, Samoyeau R, Salamon R, Mégraud F | title = cagA Status and Eradication Treatment Outcome of Anti-''Helicobacter pylori'' Triple Therapies in Patients with Nonulcer Dyspepsia | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 1319–22 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11283049 | pmc = 87932 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.39.4.1319-1322.2001 | url = http://jcm.asm.org/content/39/4/1319.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cagA'' gene codes for a relatively long (1186-[[amino acid]]) protein. The ''cag'' pathogenicity island (PAI) has about 30 genes, part of which code for a complex [[Secretion#Type IV secretion system (T4SS or TFSS)|type IV secretion system]]. The low [[GC-content]] of the ''cag'' PAI relative to the rest of the ''Helicobacter'' genome suggests the island was acquired by [[horizontal gene transfer|horizontal transfer]] from another bacterial species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomb 1997&quot;/&gt;

To avoid the acidic environment of the interior of the stomach ([[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]), ''H. pylori'' uses its flagella to burrow into the mucus lining of the stomach to reach the [[epithelial cells]] underneath, where it is less acidic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amieva2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amieva MR, El-Omar EM | title = Host-bacterial interactions in ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = 306–23 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18166359 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2007.11.009 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''H. pylori'' is able to sense the pH gradient in the mucus and move towards the less acidic region ([[chemotaxis]]).  This also keeps the bacteria from being swept away into the lumen with the bacteria's mucus environment, which is constantly moving from its site of creation at the epithelium to its dissolution at the lumen interface.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15044704&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schreiber S, Konradt M, Groll C, Scheid P, Hanauer G, Werling HO, Josenhans C, Suerbaum S | title = The spatial orientation of ''Helicobacter pylori'' in the gastric mucus | journal = Proc.

''H. pylori'' is found in the mucus, on the inner surface of the epithelium, and occasionally inside the epithelial cells themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12738380&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petersen AM, Krogfelt KA | title = ''Helicobacter pylori'': an invading microorganism?

In addition to using chemotaxis to avoid areas of low pH, ''H. pylori'' also neutralizes the acid in its environment by producing large amounts of [[urease]], which breaks down the urea present in the stomach to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[ammonia]].  The ammonia, which is basic, then neutralizes stomach acid.

===Inflammation, gastritis, and ulcer===
''H. pylori'' harms the stomach and [[Duodenum|duodenal]] linings by several mechanisms.  The ammonia produced to regulate pH is toxic to epithelial cells, as are biochemicals produced by ''H. pylori'' such as [[proteases]], vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) [this damages epithelial cells, disrupts tight junctions and causes [[apoptosis]], and certain [[phospholipases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smoot DT | title = How does ''Helicobacter pylori'' cause mucosal damage?

Colonization of the stomach by ''H. pylori'' can result in chronic [[gastritis]], an inflammation of the stomach lining, at the site of infection.  ''Helicobacter'' cysteine-rich proteins (Hcp), particularly HcpA (hp0211), are known to trigger an immune response, causing inflammation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19393649&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dumrese C, Slomianka L, Ziegler U, Choi SS, Kalia A, Fulurija A, Lu W, Berg DE, Benghezal M, Marshall B, Mittl PR | title = The secreted Helicobacter cysteine-rich protein A causes adherence of human monocytes and differentiation into a macrophage-like phenotype | journal = [[FEBS Letters]] | volume = 583 | issue = 10 | pages = 1637–43 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19393649 | pmc = 2764743 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2009.04.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chronic gastritis is likely to underlie ''H. pylori''-related diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shiotani 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shiotani A, Graham DY | title = Pathogenesis and therapy of gastric and duodenal ulcer disease | journal = Med. Clin. North Am. | volume = 86 | issue = 6 | pages = 1447–66, viii | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12510460 | doi = 10.1016/S0025-7125(02)00083-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulcers in the stomach and duodenum result when the consequences of inflammation allow stomach acid and the digestive enzyme [[pepsin]] to overwhelm the mechanisms that protect the stomach and duodenal [[mucous membranes]].  The location of colonization of ''H. pylori'', which affects the location of the ulcer, depends on the acidity of the stomach.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10749087&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dixon MF | title = Patterns of inflammation linked to ulcer disease | journal = Baillieres Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–40 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10749087 | doi = 10.1053/bega.1999.0057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In people producing large amounts of acid, ''H. pylori'' colonizes near the [[pyloric antrum]] (exit to the duodenum) to avoid the acid-secreting [[parietal cells]] at the [[fundus (stomach)|fundus]] (near the entrance to the stomach).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusters2006&quot;/&gt;  In people producing normal or reduced amounts of acid, ''H. pylori'' can also colonize the rest of the stomach.

The [[inflammatory response]] caused by bacteria colonizing near the pyloric antrum induces [[G cell]]s in the antrum to secrete the hormone [[gastrin]], which travels through the bloodstream to parietal cells in the fundus.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14755326&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blaser MJ, Atherton JC | title = ''Helicobacter pylori'' persistence: biology and disease | journal = J.

When ''H. pylori'' colonizes other areas of the stomach, the inflammatory response can result in [[atrophy]] of the stomach lining and eventually ulcers in the stomach.  This also may increase the risk of stomach cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suerbaum 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suerbaum S, Michetti P | title = ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection | journal = N.

===The ''cag'' pathogenicity island===
The pathogenicity of ''H. pylori'' may be increased by genes of the'' cag'' [[pathogenicity island]]; about 50–70% of ''H. pylori'' strains in Western countries carry it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peek 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peek RM, Crabtree JE | title = ''Helicobacter'' infection and gastric neoplasia | journal = J.

The injected peptidoglycan is recognized by the cytoplasmic [[pattern recognition receptor]] (immune sensor) Nod1, which then stimulates expression of [[cytokines]] that promote [[inflammation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Viala J, Chaput C, Boneca IG, Cardona A, Girardin SE, Moran AP, Athman R, Mémet S, Huerre MR, Coyle AJ, DiStefano PS, Sansonetti PJ, Labigne A, Bertin J, Philpott DJ, Ferrero RL | title = Nod1 responds to peptidoglycan delivered by the ''Helicobacter pylori'' ''cag'' pathogenicity island | journal = Nat.

The type-IV [[secretion]] apparatus also injects the ''cag'' PAI-encoded protein CagA into the stomach's epithelial cells, where it disrupts the [[cytoskeleton]], adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, [[Epithelial polarity|cell polarity]], and other cellular activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backert 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Backert S, Selbach M | title = Role of type IV secretion in ''Helicobacter pylori'' pathogenesis | journal = Cell.

Activation of the EGFR by ''H. pylori'' is associated with altered [[signal transduction]] and [[gene expression]] in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis. A [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) has also been suggested to be able to regulate host cell [[Transcription (genetics)|gene transcription]], independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baldwin2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11283049&quot;/&gt; A great deal of diversity exists between strains of ''H. pylori'', and the strain with which one is infected is predictive of the outcome.

===Cancer===
Two related mechanisms by which ''H. pylori'' could promote [[cancer]] are under investigation. One mechanism involves the enhanced production of [[free radical]]s near ''H. pylori'' and an increased rate of host cell [[mutation]]. The other proposed mechanism has been called a &quot;perigenetic pathway&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsuji S, Kawai N, Tsujii M, Kawano S, Hori M | title = Review article: inflammation-related promotion of gastrointestinal carcinogenesis--a perigenetic pathway | journal = Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. | volume = 18 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 82–9 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12925144 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2036.18.s1.22.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and involves enhancement of the transformed host cell phenotype by means of alterations in cell proteins, such as [[cell adhesion|adhesion]] proteins. ''H. pylori'' has been proposed to induce [[inflammation]] and locally high levels of [[TNF-α]] and/or [[interleukin 6]] (IL-6). According to the proposed perigenetic mechanism, inflammation-associated signaling molecules, such as TNF-α, can alter gastric epithelial cell adhesion and lead to the dispersion and migration of mutated epithelial cells without the need for additional mutations in [[tumor suppressor gene]]s, such as genes that code for cell adhesion proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Suganuma M, Yamaguchi K, Ono Y, Matsumoto H, Hayashi T, Ogawa T, Imai K, Kuzuhara T, Nishizono A, Fujiki H | title = TNF-α-inducing protein, a carcinogenic factor secreted from ''H. pylori'', enters gastric cancer cells | journal = Int.

The strain of ''H. pylori'' to which a person is exposed may influence the risk of developing gastric cancer. Strains of ''H. pylori'' that produce high levels of two proteins, vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), appear to cause greater tissue damage than those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely. These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion is underway. As a result of the bacterial presence, neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kim, W.  |author2=Moss, S.F. |title=The role of H. pylori in the development of stomach cancer|journal=Oncology Review.|volume=1|issue=Suppl 1|pages=165–168|date=December 2008|url=http://pylori.org/h-pylori-stomach-cancer/|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survival of ''H. pylori''===
The pathogenesis of ''H. pylori'' depends on its ability to survive in the harsh gastric environment characterized by acidity, peristalsis, and attack by phagocytes accompanied by release of reactive oxygen species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olczak AA, Olson JW, Maier RJ | title = Oxidative-stress resistance mutants of ''Helicobacter pylori'' | journal = J. Bacteriol. | volume = 184 | issue = 12 | pages = 3186–93 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12029034 | pmc = 135082 | doi = 10.1128/JB.184.12.3186-3193.2002 | url = http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12029034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, ''H. pylori'' elicits an oxidative stress response during host colonization.  This oxidative stress response induces potentially lethal and mutagenic oxidative DNA adducts in the ''H. pylori'' genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Rourke EJ, Chevalier C, Pinto AV, Thiberge JM, Ielpi L, Labigne A, Radicella JP | title = Pathogen DNA as target for host-generated oxidative stress: role for repair of bacterial DNA damage in ''Helicobacter pylori'' colonization | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2789–94 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12601164 | pmc = 151419 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0337641100 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12601164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulnerability to oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage occurs commonly in many studied bacterial pathogens, including ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. mutans'', and ''H. pylori''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | journal = Infect. Genet. Evol. | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–85 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18295550 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567-1348(08)00004-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;   For each of these pathogens, surviving the DNA damage induced by oxidative stress appears to be supported by transformation-mediated recombinational repair.  Thus, transformation and recombinational repair appear to contribute to successful infection.

[[Transformation (genetics)|Transformation]] (the transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium) appears to be part of an adaptation for DNA repair.  ''H. pylori'' is naturally competent for transformation.  While many organisms are competent only under certain environmental conditions, such as starvation, ''H. pylori'' is competent throughout logarithmic growth.&lt;ref name=Dorer&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Dorer MS, Fero J, Salama NR | title = DNA damage triggers genetic exchange in ''Helicobacter pylori'' | journal = PLoS Pathog. | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e1001026 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20686662 | pmc = 2912397 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001026 | url = http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001026 | editor1-last = Blanke | editor1-first = Steven R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All organisms encode genetic programs for response to stressful conditions including those that cause DNA damage.&lt;ref name=Dorer /&gt; In ''H. pylori'', homologous recombination is required for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The AddAB helicase-nuclease complex resects DSBs and loads RecA onto single-strand DNA (ssDNA), which then mediates strand exchange, leading to homologous recombination and repair. The requirement of RecA plus AddAB for efficient gastric colonization suggests, in the stomach, ''H. pylori'' is either exposed to double-strand DNA damage that must be repaired or requires some other recombination-mediated event.  In particular, natural transformation is increased by DNA damage in ''H. pylori'', and a connection exists between the DNA damage response and DNA uptake in ''H. pylori'',&lt;ref name=Dorer /&gt; suggesting natural competence contributes to persistence of ''H. pylori'' in its human host and explains the retention of competence in most clinical isolates.

RuvC protein is essential to the process of recombinational repair, since it resolves intermediates in this process termed Holliday junctions.  ''H. pylori'' mutants that are defective in RuvC have increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and to oxidative stress, exhibit reduced survival within macrophages, and are unable to establish successful infection in a mouse model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loughlin MF, Barnard FM, Jenkins D, Sharples GJ, Jenks PJ | title = ''Helicobacter pylori'' mutants defective in RuvC Holliday junction resolvase display reduced macrophage survival and spontaneous clearance from the murine gastric mucosa | journal = Infect.

Some drugs can affect ''H. pylori'' urease activity and give [[false negative]]s with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting ''H. pylori'' infection is with a [[histological]] examination from two sites after endoscopic [[biopsy]], combined with either a [[rapid urease test]] or microbial culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Logan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Logan RP, Walker MM | title = Epidemiology and diagnosis of ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection | journal = BMJ | volume = 323 | issue = 7318 | pages = 920–2 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11668141 | pmc = 1121445 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.323.7318.920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once ''H. pylori'' is detected in a person with a peptic ulcer, the normal procedure is to eradicate it and allow the ulcer to heal.

Instead of treating patients with traditional antibiotics, doctors may be able to use light or vitamin D [291,292]. Indeed using narrow-band UV B light, the level of vitamin D was increased in psoriasis patients (psoriasis is a common autoimmune disease on skin) [293]. In addition, other small molecules such as butyrate can induce LL-37 expression [294]. Components from Traditional Chinese Medicine may regulate the AMP expression as well [295]. These factors may induce the expression of a single peptide or multiple AMPs [296]. It is also possible that certain factors can work together to induce AMP expression. While cyclic AMP and butyrate synergistically stimulate the expression of chicken β-defensin 9 [297], 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (or lactose) can induce AMP gene expression synergistically [294,298]. It appears that stimulation of LL-37 expression by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors is cell dependent. Trichostatin and sodium butyrate increased the peptide expression in human NCI-H292 airway epithelial cells but not in the primary cultures of normal nasal epithelial cells [299]. However, the induction of the human LL-37 expression may not be a general approach for bacterial clearance. During Salmonella enterica infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages, LL-37 is neither induced nor required for bacterial clearance [300].}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035769/table/pharmaceuticals-07-00545-t003/ Table 3: Select human antimicrobial peptides and their proposed targets]&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035769/table/pharmaceuticals-07-00545-t004/ Table 4: Some known factors that induce antimicrobial peptide expression]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Primary - Butyrate and LL-37 target&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yonezawa H, Osaki T, Hanawa T, Kurata S, Zaman C, Woo TD, Takahashi M, Matsubara S, Kawakami H, Ochiai K, Kamiya S | title = Destructive effects of butyrate on the cell envelope of Helicobacter pylori | journal = J.

==Prognosis==
''H. pylori'' colonizes the stomach and induces chronic [[gastritis]], a long-lasting inflammation of the stomach. The bacterium persists in the stomach for decades in most people. Most individuals infected by ''H. pylori'' will never experience clinical symptoms despite having chronic gastritis. About 10–20% of those colonized by ''H. pylori'' will ultimately develop gastric and duodenal ulcers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusters2006&quot;/&gt; ''H. pylori'' infection is also associated with a 1–2% lifetime risk of [[gastric carcinoma|stomach cancer]] and a less than 1% risk of gastric [[MALT lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kusters2006&quot;/&gt;

In the absence of treatment, ''H. pylori'' infection—once established in its gastric niche—is widely believed to persist for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt; In the elderly, however, infection likely can disappear as the stomach's mucosa becomes increasingly [[Atrophy|atrophic]] and inhospitable to colonization.

Person-to-person transmission by either the oral–oral or [[fecal–oral route]] is most likely. Consistent with these transmission routes, the bacteria have been isolated from [[feces]], [[saliva]], and [[dental plaque]] of some infected people. Findings suggest ''H. pylori'' is more easily transmitted by gastric mucus than saliva.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt; Transmission occurs mainly within families in developed nations, yet can also be acquired from the community in developing countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17382274&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Delport W, van der Merwe SW | title = The transmission of ''Helicobacter pylori'': the effects of analysis method and study population on inference | journal = Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–36 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17382274 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpg.2006.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''H. pylori'' may also be transmitted orally by means of fecal matter through the ingestion of waste-tainted water, so a hygienic environment could help decrease the risk of ''H. pylori'' infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt;

==Evolution==
''H. pylori'' migrated out of Africa along with its human host ''circa'' 60,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Correa2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Correa P, Piazuelo MB | title = Evolutionary History of the ''Helicobacter pylori'' Genome: Implications for Gastric Carcinogenesis | journal = Gut Liver | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–8 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22375167 | pmc = 3286735 | doi = 10.5009/gnl.2012.6.1.21 | url = http://gutnliver.org/journal/journal_view.html?year=2012&amp;vol=006&amp;num=01&amp;page=21 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Its subsequent evolution created seven prototypes—Europe (isolated from Europe, the Middle East, India, and Iran), NE Africa (from northeast Africa), Africa1 (from countries in Western Africa and South Africa), Africa2 (from South Africa), Asia2 (from Northern India and among isolates from Bangladesh, Thailand, and Malaysia), Sahul (from Australian Aboriginals and Papua New Guineans) and East Asia with the subpopulations E Asia (from East Asians), Maori (from Taiwanese Aboriginals, Melanesians and Polynesians) and Amerind (Native Americans). The precursors of these prototypes have been named ancestral Europe1, ancestral Europe2, ancestral East Asia, ancestral Africa1, ancestral Africa2, and ancestral Sahul. These ancestral prototypes appear to have originated in Africa and Central and East Asia.  European and African strains were introduced into the Americas along with its colonisation—both thousands of years ago and more recently in the slave trade.

Recent research states that [[genetic diversity]] in ''H. pylori'', like that of its host, decreases with geographic distance from [[Eastern Africa|East Africa]]. Using the genetic diversity data,  researchers have created simulations that indicate the bacteria seem to have spread from East Africa around 58,000 years ago. Their results indicate modern humans were already infected by ''H. pylori'' before their migrations out of Africa, and it has remained associated with human hosts since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Linz B, Balloux F, Moodley Y, Manica A, Liu H, Roumagnac P, Falush D, Stamer C, Prugnolle F, van der Merwe SW, Yamaoka Y, Graham DY, Perez-Trallero E, Wadstrom T, Suerbaum S, Achtman M | title = An African origin for the intimate association between humans and ''Helicobacter pylori'' | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = 7130 | pages = 915–8 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17287725 | pmc = 1847463 | doi = 10.1038/nature05562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori}}
''H. pylori'' was first discovered in the stomachs of patients with gastritis and ulcers in 1982 by Drs. [[Barry Marshall]] and [[Robin Warren]] of [[Perth, Australia]]. At the time, the conventional thinking was that no bacterium could live in the acid environment of the human stomach. In recognition of their discovery, Marshall and Warren were awarded the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/2005/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2005|accessdate=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the research of Marshall and Warren, German scientists found spiral-shaped [[bacteria]] in the lining of the human stomach in 1875, but they were unable to [[Microbiological culture|culture]] them, and the results were eventually forgotten.&lt;ref name=Blaser_2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blaser MJ | title = An endangered species in the stomach | journal = Sci. Am. | volume = 292 | issue = 2 | pages = 38–45 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15715390 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0205-38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian researcher [[Giulio Bizzozero]] described similarly shaped bacteria living in the acidic environment of the stomach of dogs in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bizzozero G|authorlink=Giulio Bizzozero|year=1893|title=Ueber die schlauchförmigen Drüsen des Magendarmkanals und die Beziehungen ihres Epitheles zu dem Oberflächenepithel der Schleimhaut |journal=Archiv für mikroskopische Anatomie|volume=42|pages=82–152|doi=10.1007/BF02975307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Walery Jaworski]] of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]] investigated sediments of gastric washings obtained by [[Gastric lavage|lavage]] from humans in 1899. Among some rod-like bacteria, he also found bacteria with a characteristic spiral shape, which he called ''Vibrio rugula''. He was the first to suggest a possible role of this organism in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases. His work was included in the ''Handbook of Gastric Diseases'', but it had little impact, as it was written in Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konturek JW | title = Discovery by Jaworski of ''Helicobacter pylori'' and its pathogenetic role in peptic ulcer, gastritis and gastric cancer | journal = J.

Interest in understanding the role of bacteria in stomach diseases was rekindled in the 1970s, with the visualization of bacteria in the stomachs of people with gastric ulcers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steer 1975&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Steer HW | title = Ultrastructure of cell migration through the gastric epithelium and its relationship to bacteria | journal = J. Clin.

After unsuccessful attempts at culturing the bacteria from the stomach, they finally succeeded in visualizing colonies in 1982, when they unintentionally left their [[Petri dishes]] incubating for five days over the [[Easter]] weekend. In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by bacterial infection and not by [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or [[Spice|spicy food]], as had been assumed before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall BJ, Warren JR | title = Unidentified curved bacilli in the stomach of patients with gastritis and peptic ulceration | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8390 | pages = 1311–5 | date = June 1984 | pmid = 6145023 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(84)91816-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some skepticism was expressed initially, but within a few years multiple research groups had verified the association of ''H. pylori'' with gastritis and, to a lesser extent, ulcers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/bacteria_ulcers_and_ostracism_h._pylori_and_the_making_of_a_myth/|title=Bacteria, Ulcers, and Ostracism? ''H. pylori'' and the making of a myth|year=2004|author=Atwood IV KC|accessdate=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate ''H. pylori'' caused gastritis and was not merely a bystander, Marshall drank a beaker of ''H. pylori'' culture. He became ill with nausea and vomiting several days later. An [[endoscopy]] 10 days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and the presence of ''H. pylori''. These results suggested ''H. pylori'' was the causative agent. Marshall and Warren went on to demonstrate  antibiotics are effective in the treatment of many cases of gastritis. In 1987, the Sydney [[Gastroenterology|gastroenterologist]] [[Thomas Borody]] invented the first triple therapy for the treatment of duodenal ulcers.&lt;ref name=Borody_1989&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borody TJ, Cole P, Noonan S, Morgan A, Lenne J, Hyland L, Brandl S, Borody EG, George LL | title = Recurrence of duodenal ulcer and ''Campylobacter pylori'' infection after eradication | journal = Med. J. Aust. | volume = 151 | issue = 8 | pages = 431–5 | date = October 1989 | pmid = 2687668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the [[National Institutes of Health]] stated most recurrent duodenal and gastric ulcers were caused by ''H. pylori'', and recommended antibiotics be included in the treatment regimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Helicobacter pylori'' in peptic ulcer disease|work=NIH Consensus Statement Online|date=January 7–9, 1994|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|accessdate=December 21, 2004|url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1994/1994HelicobacterPyloriUlcer094html.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bacterium was initially named ''Campylobacter pyloridis'', then renamed ''C. pylori'' (''pylori'' being the [[genitive]] of ''[[pylorus]]'',  the circular opening leading from the stomach into the [[duodenum]], from the Ancient Greek word πυλωρός, which means [[gatekeeper]].&lt;ref name=Liddell1980/&gt;). When [[16S ribosomal RNA]] [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]] and other research showed in 1989 that the bacterium did not belong in the genus ''[[Campylobacter]]'', it was placed in its own [[genus]], ''[[Helicobacter]]'' from the [[ancient Greek]] ''hělix''/έλιξ &quot;spiral&quot; or &quot;coil&quot;.&lt;ref name=Liddell1980&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Henry George Liddell|Liddell HG]], [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott R]]|title=A Lexicon: Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|year=1966|isbn=0-19-910207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1987, a group of experts met in Copenhagen to found the European ''Helicobacter'' Study Group (EHSG), an international multidisciplinary research group and the only institution focused on ''H. pylori''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Buckley MJ, O'Morain CA|title=Helicobacter biology—discovery|journal=Br Med Bull|year=1998|volume=54|issue=1|pages=7–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group is involved with the Annual International Workshop on Helicobacter and Related Bacteria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mégraud F|title=European Helicobacter Study Group.
