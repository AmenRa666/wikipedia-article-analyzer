The '''1949 Ambato earthquake'''  was the largest [[earthquake]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]] in more than five years. On August 5, 1949, it struck Ecuador's [[Tungurahua Province]] southeast of its capital  [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]] and killed 5,050&amp;nbsp;people. Measuring 6.8 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] it originated from a  [[hypocenter]] {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} beneath the surface. The nearby villages of [[Guano, Ecuador|Guano]], [[Patate]], [[Pelileo]], and [[Pillaro]] were destroyed, and the city of Ambato suffered heavy damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuakeHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/today/index.php?month=8&amp;day=5&amp;submit=View+Date |title=Today in Earthquake History: August 5 |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earthquake flattened entire buildings, and subsequent [[landslide]]s caused damage throughout the [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], and [[Cotopaxi Province]]s. It disrupted water mains and communication lines and opened a fissure into which the small town of [[Libertad, Ecuador|Libertad]] sank. Moderate shaking from the event extended as far away as [[Quito]] and [[Guayaquil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;QuakeHistory&quot;/&gt;

Earthquakes in Ecuador stem from two major interrelated tectonic areas: the [[subduction]] of the [[Nazca Plate]] under the [[South American Plate]] and the  [[Andean Volcanic Belt]]. The 1949 Ambato earthquake initially followed an intersection of several northwest-southeast-trending faults in the Inter-Andean Valley which were created by the subduction of the  [[Carnegie Ridge]]. Strata of rock cracked as the earthquake ruptured the faults, sending out powerful shockwaves. Today threats exist throughout the country from both  [[interplate earthquake|interplate]] and [[intraplate earthquake|intraplate]] seismicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Espinosa&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Espinosa |first1=A.F. |last2=Hall |first2=M.L. |last3=Yepes |first3=H. |editor1-last=Schuster |editor1-first=R.L. |editor2-last=Egred |editor2-first=J |title=The March 5, 1987, Ecuador earthquakes: mass wasting and socioeconomic effects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZwE_5XDtugC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=schuster+egred+1949+earthquake#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |series=Natural disaster studies, an investigative series of the committee on natural disasters |date=1991 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-04444-8 |pages=29–31 |chapter=Tectonics and Seismicity| accessdate= 17 September 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Earthquakes are common in Ecuador. Near the [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]] [[subduction]] zone the recorded history of  [[interplate earthquake]]s spans 80&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Espinosa&quot;/&gt; At the time it struck the 1949 Ambato earthquake was the second-worst earthquake in Ecuador's modern history topped only by the [[1797 Riobamba earthquake]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt; and the most devastating earthquake in the Western Hemisphere since the [[1944 San Juan earthquake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title = Disaster Strikes Ecuador: In the Shadow of the Andes 5,000 Die In Earthquake | journal = [[Life (magazine)|Life]] | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages= 26–27 | date = August 22, 1949 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=00kEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Disaster+Strikes+Ecuador:+In+the+Shadow+of+the+Andes+5,000+Die+In+Earthquake#v=onepage&amp;q=Ecuador&amp;f=false |accessdate = November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several major earthquakes have occurred throughout the country since 1949, including the  [[1987 Ecuador earthquakes]] and the 1997 Ecuador earthquake. The [[2007 Peru earthquake]] also affected the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecuador&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/historical_country.php#ecuador |title=Historic World Earthquakes |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |date=November 23, 2009 |accessdate=August 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100728221758/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/historical_country.php| archivedate= 28 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
[[File:South American plates.png|thumb|left|The [[Nazca Plate]] is being subducted under the [[South American Plate]], generating volcanism and extensive seismicity.]]
Much of South American seismic activity and volcanism originates from [[subduction]] of the [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] [[Nazca Plate]] under the continental [[South American Plate]] and subduction of the Pacific's [[lithosphere]] under the South American continent. This seismicity extends for {{convert|6000|km|mi|0|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} along the continent's western edge and probably stems from a region of northeast-trending [[fault (geology)|faulting]] near the Ecuadorian Trench. The region of faulting may actually function as its own microplate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Espinosa&quot;/&gt;

The [[Carnegie Ridge]] is sliding under Ecuadorian land, causing coastal uplift and volcanism. The ridge's movement may also have changed the type of faulting along the coast, causing [[strike-slip fault]]s (faults that move horizontally past each other). Evidence of this subduction altering the course of faulting is found at the Yaquina fault, which, unlike the rest of the [[Panama Basin]] faults, trends to the west instead of north-south, indicating that the Carnegie Ridge may be colliding with the continental mass of Ecuador. This collision created northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest-trending faults in the region, and with that, caused strong earthquakes in Riobamba in 1797 and [[Alausi, Ecuador|Alausi]] in 1961. Several of the northwest-southeast-trending faults converge in the [[Inter-Andean Valley]] where the 1949 Ambato earthquake took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Espinosa&quot;/&gt;

The [[hypocenter]] of the earthquake occurred {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on }} beneath the surface, under a mountain {{convert|72|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Ambato. Nearby fault lines ruptured, breaking rock strata and sending shock waves to the surface capable of bringing down entire buildings. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' reported that local seismologists first placed the earthquake's magnitude at 7.5,&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;/&gt; but the official measurement was later revised to 6.8.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuakeHistory&quot;/&gt;

== Damage and casualties ==
[[File:Ambato Earthquake - Pelileo Ruins.jpg|thumb||The ruins of homes in [[Pelileo]] after the earthquake]]
The earthquake was preceded by a [[foreshock]] which although modest was strong enough to cause chaos and force people to flee from their homes into the streets. The main shock [[epicenter|originated]] southeast of Ambato.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecuador&quot;/&gt; When the primary shock hit Ambato's main cathedral and military barracks collapsed, as did most of the city's buildings, scores of young girls preparing for their  [[first communion]]s perished in the cathedral.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilJournal&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zvQZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pyMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3783,2390574 |title=Toll in Quake Is Up to 2,700 Dead, Report |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]] |publisher=Harry J.

Initial reports (around August 7) estimated the death toll at 2,700&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name=SHL&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Hh8hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4199,3582216 |title=Ecuador Earthquake: Thousands Are Injured |date=August 7, 1949 |work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |publisher=[[Diane McFarlin]] |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cities of [[Patate]] and Pelileo suffered the most with 1,000 and 1,300&amp;nbsp;dead respectively. In [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]] reports of the death toll ranged from 400 to 500, and the  [[List of diplomatic missions of Ecuador|Ecuadorean Embassy in Washington, D.C.]], estimated that 1,000 to more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;people were injured.&lt;ref name=SHL/&gt; The town of [[Pillaro]], destroyed by the quake, had more than 20 dead, and in [[Latacunga]], 11 were killed and 30 injured; 50&amp;nbsp;homes, two churches, and the local government building were also ruined.&lt;ref name=SHL/&gt; Fifteen other towns and cities were also badly affected,&lt;ref name=SHL/&gt; including [[Guano, Ecuador|Guano]] which was devastated.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuakeHistory&quot;/&gt;

Later counts assumed around 3,200&amp;nbsp;casualties in Pelileo; the total death toll estimates were adjusted to around 4,000&amp;nbsp;people. Officials reported that many of the dead had been inside buildings as they buckled or were killed by flooding brought about by the blockage of a  [[Ditch|drainage canal]]. Others were crushed by landslides from nearby mountains. No homes in the city of Pelileo were left standing, many buildings were flattened, and large cracks formed in the ground. In Ambato alone 75 percent of the homes still standing had to be demolished.&lt;ref name=Homeless&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19490809&amp;id=7rIrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rf4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2096,974370&amp;hl=el |title=100,000 Homeless In Ecuadorian Earthquake |date=August 9, 1949 |work=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]] |publisher=Terrence Williams |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 8, an [[aftershock]] with &quot;considerable strength&quot; struck near Ambato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tq0fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-9YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6856,4374191 |title=Another Earthquake Strikes in Ecuador |date=August 9, 1949 |work=The Southeast Missourian |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final death toll according to the [[United States Geological Survey]] was 5,050.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuakeHistory&quot;/&gt; The earthquake severely affected some 30&amp;nbsp;communities and left approximately 100,000&amp;nbsp;people homeless.&lt;ref name=Homeless/&gt;

== Relief efforts ==
Ecuador's [[List of heads of state of Ecuador|President]] [[Galo Plaza|Galo Plaza Lasso]] flew to Ambato to take personal charge of the primary relief efforts. Plaza directed rescue efforts for two days as airlifts from Quito dropped supplies. A group of Red Cross volunteers and medical supplies were sent on American aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt; The United States Army sent two relief teams equipped with serum and blood plasma. The mayor of Miami along with seven other politicians began a fund-raising campaign for medical needs and clothing and coordinated the distribution of  {{convert|69|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} of [[Rexall]] drugs.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=378LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g1UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3533,5026107 |title=Florida East Coast Cities Head Drive to Supply Relief to Stricken Ecuador |work=[[Evening Independent]] |date=August 12, 1949 |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several nearby countries sent airplanes carrying medicine and food.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Age&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xrEUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vb0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4364,3673526 |title=Ecuador's Earthquake: Stern Measures Taken by the Government |date=August 11, 1949 |work=[[The Age]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local fund-raising effort collected 250,000&amp;nbsp;[[Ecuadorian sucre]]s (approximately $14,815 1949 USD) within two&amp;nbsp;hours of its launch.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilJournal&quot;/&gt; Plaza said &quot;We have not lost our courage. Neither Ambato nor Ecuador shall cry any more, but begin to work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;

On August 7 a plane carrying 34 rescue workers from the [[Shell Oil Company]] crashed {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Ambato leaving no survivors.&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite news |title=Latest Reports on Earthquake |date=August 8, 1949 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disease began to spread in Pelileo within days of the earthquake which prompted a team of American soldiers – who were acting as relief workers – to order water purification devices and  [[DDT]] airdrops to cleanse the area of airborne agents. Sick victims were quarantined and prevented from leaving the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Age&quot;/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Ambato Earthquake - Ruined Hospital.jpg|thumb||A hospital ruined by the earthquake in [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]]; almost 75&amp;nbsp;percent of the city's remaining buildings had to be demolished.]]
The earthquake considerably impacted a number of cities: it destroyed Guano, Patate, Pelileo, Pillaro, and one-third of Ambato.&lt;ref name=QuakeHistory/&gt; The city of Ambato was a &quot;scene of anguish and pain&quot; described by &quot;scores of little funerals winding their way through the debris&quot;.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; The brand-new hospital had been reduced to four walls, and most of the buildings in town were demolished.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; In Pelileo relief workers found victims feeding buried people through holes in the ground. In the days following the earthquakes aftershocks occurred and torrential rains ensued.&lt;ref name=SMH2&gt;{{cite news |title=Ecuador Victims Homeless in Downpour |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=August 10, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to help the inhabitants a festival of fruit and flowers was held on June 29, 1950. The festival was a success and became an annual event that is celebrated each year during [[Carnival|Carnaval]] and is now an important tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecuador.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecuador.com/blog/the-festival-of-fruit-and-flowers-in-ambato |title=The Festival of Fruit and Flowers in Ambato |publisher=New Media Holdings Company |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiestas de Ambato&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiestasdeambato.com/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=7 |title=Historia de la Fiesta de la Fruta y de las Flores |author=Fiestas de Ambato |date=2010 |language=Spanish |publisher=Comité Permanente de la Fiesta de la Fruta y de las Flores (Standing Committee of the Festival of Fruit and Flowers) |accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambato was completely rebuilt after the earthquake. The city's main church, the Iglesia Matriz de Ambato, was replaced by a new cathedral known as Iglesia La Catedral in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Municipalidad de Ambato&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ambato.gov.ec/catedral.html |title=Iglesia La Catedral |publisher=Municipalidad de Ambato |date=2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429025556/http://ambato.gov.ec/catedral.html |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pelileo was rebuilt on a new site {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} from its previous location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whiteford&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/rs4hazards/kknutsen/ShadowVolcanoTechnicalReport2002.pdf |title=In the shadow of the volcano: human health and community resilience |last=Whiteford |first=L.M. |author2=Tobin G.A. |author3=Laspina C. |author4=Yepes H. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Center for Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance (at the University of South Florida) |date=2002 |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current situation ==
Ambato is frequently visited by tourists traveling on the [[Pan-American Highway]]. The city is well known for its extensive market which sells a wide array of items including local delicacies and flowers, and for its  ''quintas'' – old estates that serve as historic parks – some of which pre-date the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=St. Louis |first=Regis |title=Lonely Planet Ecuador &amp; the Galapagos Islands |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |ref={{sfnRef |Louis |2009}} |date=2009 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecuador is still at risk from earthquakes: both [[intraplate earthquake|intraplate]] (such as those in March 1987) and [[interplate earthquake]]s are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, as it can be much more powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, [[subsidence]], and even [[soil liquefaction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Espinosa&quot;/&gt;
