&quot;'''Through the Looking Glass'''&quot; is the third season finale of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', consisting of the 22nd and 23rd episodes of the [[Lost (season 3)|third season]]. It is also the 71st and 72nd episodes overall. It was written by co-creator/executive producer [[Damon Lindelof]] and executive producer [[Carlton Cuse]], and directed by executive producer [[Jack Bender]]. When first aired on May 23, 2007, in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], it was watched by an average of 14 million American viewers. Like the previous two [[season finale]]s, it was two hours long with advertisements, twice the length of a normal episode. It was edited into two individual episodes when released on DVD. The season finale is considered by some to be one of the best episodes of television ever broadcast. The episode garnered a number of awards and nominations, including three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s nominations and a [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nomination.

The episode begins its narrative in late December 2004, over ninety days after the crash of [[Oceanic Airlines]] Flight 815. The battle between the crash survivors and the dangerous and mysterious island inhabitants referred to as the &quot;[[Others (Lost)|Others]]&quot; comes to a head as ten of the Others attack and are then ambushed at the survivors' camp and are subsequently killed. Meanwhile, [[Jack Shephard]] (played by [[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) leads most of the survivors to the island's radio tower to communicate with a nearby ship. Intercut with this story are off-island scenes spotlighting Jack, who has become suicidally depressed and addicted to painkillers. In a [[twist ending]], it is revealed that these scenes are [[flashforward]]s to sometime in the future, after Jack has left the island, rather than [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] as in previous episodes of ''Lost''.

== Plot ==
The Others intend to attack the camp and kidnap pregnant women for scientific research.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF2&quot; /&gt; The survivors are tipped off by the &quot;Other&quot; [[Characters of Lost#Karl|Karl]] ([[Blake Bashoff]]) and plan to kill the Others with dynamite-rigged tents.&lt;ref name=&quot;hits&quot; /&gt; [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]), [[Jin-Soo Kwon|Jin Kwon]] ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), and [[Bernard Nadler]] ([[Sam Anderson]]) remain at the beach, tasked with shooting the tents while the rest of the survivors journey with [[Danielle Rousseau]] ([[Mira Furlan]]) to the radio tower to communicate with [[Characters of Lost#Naomi Dorrit|Naomi Dorrit's]] ([[Marsha Thomason]]) nearby ship. The Others arrive, and while Sayid and Bernard detonate their tents, Jin misses his target, which results in their capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF3&quot; /&gt; After hearing only two explosions, [[James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) and [[Juliet Burke]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]) turn back to see if they can help. [[Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes]] ([[Jorge Garcia]]), who was not allowed to accompany Sawyer and Juliet because of his weight, drives the van he found onto the beach,&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF4&quot; /&gt; and the captives gain the upper hand, killing the remaining Others with the help of Sawyer and Juliet.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;/&gt; [[Tom (Lost)|Tom]] ([[M. C. Gainey|M.C. Gainey]]) surrenders but Sawyer shoots him anyway.

In [[Dharma Initiative#Station ?: The Looking Glass|The Looking Glass]], a research station of the [[Dharma Initiative]], [[Charlie Pace]] ([[Dominic Monaghan]]) is captured by the resident Others [[Characters of Lost#The Others|Greta]] ([[Lana Parrilla]]) and [[Characters of Lost#The Others|Bonnie]] ([[Tracy Middendorf]]). [[Ben Linus]] ([[Michael Emerson]]) learns of Charlie's infiltration and sends [[Characters of Lost#Mikhail Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin]] ([[Andrew Divoff]]) to the station to kill the three to preserve the signal jamming. Mikhail arrives and kills Greta and Bonnie, only to be shot through the chest with a spear gun by [[Desmond Hume]] ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]) who emerges from a closet where he had hidden after diving down a short time after Charlie. Getting the code from Bonnie before she dies (the notes to the middle eight of &quot;[[Good Vibrations]]&quot; by [[The Beach Boys]]), Charlie disables the jammer, and is contacted by [[Characters of Lost#Penny Widmore|Penny Widmore]] ([[Sonya Walger]]) via video transmission. Penny informs Charlie that she does not know Naomi, and did not send the boat that Naomi claims to be from. Despite his injury, Mikhail manages to swim out of the station and blasts the window of the jamming room with a grenade, killing himself and flooding the communications room.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF5&quot; /&gt; Charlie locks the door to save Desmond from drowning with him, but before he drowns, Charlie writes on his hand so Desmond can read: &quot;NOT PENNY'S BOAT&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot; /&gt;

[[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] ([[Terry O'Quinn]]), one of the survivors, has been shot by Ben.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF6&quot; /&gt; Finding his legs paralyzed again, Locke is about to commit suicide, when he is stopped by what appears to be [[Walt Lloyd]] ([[Malcolm David Kelley]]). Meanwhile, Ben tells [[Characters of Lost#Richard|Richard Alpert]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]) to lead the rest of the Others to the &quot;Temple&quot; and then leaves the Others, with his adopted daughter [[Alex (Lost)|Alex]] ([[Tania Raymonde]]) – Rousseau's daughter and Karl's girlfriend&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF7&quot; /&gt; – to meet up with the survivors to persuade Jack not to call Naomi's ship for rescue.&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot; /&gt;

Kate is upset about Sawyer not wanting her to come back to the beach with him to rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Jack tells her it is because Sawyer was trying to protect her. When she asks why Jack is defending Sawyer, Jack informs [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) that it is because he loves her. Kate also witnessed a kiss between him and Juliet. Ben and Alex intercept Jack's group; Ben informs Jack that Naomi is not who she says she is, and making contact with her boat will be disastrous for everyone. Ben orders the shooting of Sayid, Jin, and Bernard, and when Jack hears three shots, he attacks Ben and punches him in the face repeatedly. Unknown to Jack, the shots were fired into the sand, following earlier orders from Ben. Rousseau meets her sixteen-year-old daughter Alex, who was kidnapped by the Others shortly after her birth,&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF8&quot; /&gt; and they tie Ben up. The trek party, now able to get a signal, arrives at the radio tower. Rousseau disables her distress signal, freeing the frequency for Naomi. However, Naomi is knifed in the back by Locke, who threatens to kill Jack if he calls Naomi's boat. Locke cannot bring himself to kill Jack, who communicates with George Minkowski ([[Fisher Stevens]]) on Naomi's boat. Minkowski tells the survivors they will be sending rescue.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;/&gt;

In the flash sequences, Jack is shown to be depressed, bearded, heavily drinking and addicted to [[Oxycodone]]. After reading about the death of someone he knew, Jack appears to be ready to commit suicide by jumping off the [[Sixth Street Viaduct]] bridge. However, he is distracted by a car crash and goes to save the victims. Later, Jack visits the memorial service for the person he read about and finds himself to be the only attendee. In the last of the flashes, Kate appears and Jack discusses the island with her. It becomes clear that the sequences are actually [[flashforward]]s rather than flashbacks. &lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF9&quot;&gt;Snierson, Dan, (January 4, 2007) &quot;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20169281_2,00.html ''Lost''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Matthew Fox Flashforwards to Season 4]&quot;, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Retrieved on January 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack tells Kate about the memorial service. Kate says that she did not know about it, but she would not have attended even if she did. Jack also talks about using the &quot;golden pass&quot; they had received from [[Oceanic Airlines]] to fly back and forth across the [[Pacific Ocean]] every Friday, hoping that he will crash in the island. Jack laments that they should have never left and must return. However, Kate disagrees and leaves, not wanting to continue a conversation that they have apparently had before.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF10&quot; /&gt;

== Production ==
[[Image:Lost chair.jpg|right|thumb|300px|From left to right: actors [[Jorge Garcia]] and [[Daniel Dae Kim]] with executive producers [[Damon Lindelof]], [[Carlton Cuse]] and [[Bryan Burk]]]]

The episode's title is an allusion to [[Lewis Carroll]]'s novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;podcast&quot; /&gt; and a reference to the fictitious [[Dharma Initiative]] station featured in the [[Greatest Hits (Lost)|previous episode]]. Shooting began on April 13, 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF11&quot; /&gt; and ended on May 7, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF12&quot; /&gt;  The writers were so far behind schedule that parts of the episode were shot while later parts were still being written.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF13&quot; /&gt;  Filming mostly took place on [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]], with additional scenes shot in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF14&quot; /&gt;  The hospital scenes were filmed on the same sets used for the ABC show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF15&quot; /&gt;

Despite not being mentioned in the official press release,&lt;ref name=&quot;press&quot;/&gt; then-15-year-old [[Malcolm David Kelley]] returned to reprise his role as 10-year-old [[Walt Lloyd]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF16&quot; /&gt; and received credit as a &quot;special guest star&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF17&quot; /&gt;  Kelley’s character had left the island in the second season finale,&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF18&quot; /&gt; only 26 days prior to the events of &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;; however, Kelley had not filmed an episode in over a year.  In his single scene, Walt has visibly aged, appears taller and has a deeper voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF19&quot; /&gt;  The producers had hoped that [[Harold Perrineau]], who plays Walt's father [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael Dawson]], would return in this episode, but he was busy filming the [[pilot episode|pilot]] for [[CBS]]' ''Demons''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF20&quot; /&gt;  Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse lent their voices for the unseen roles of the flight captain and newscaster, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF23&quot; /&gt;

This episode concluded the story arc about Charlie's death, which began earlier in the season when Desmond prophesied Charlie's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF24&quot; /&gt;  Throughout the season, Charlie escaped death;&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF25&quot; /&gt; however, Desmond told Charlie that he had to die in order for his girlfriend, [[Claire Littleton]], to get rescued from the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;hits&quot;/&gt;  The storyline of Charlie's death was conceived while producing the latter part of the [[Lost (season 2)|second season]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF26&quot; /&gt; after the storyline of Charlie's [[heroin|drug addiction]] finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF27&quot; /&gt;  The news of his character's death was broken to Monaghan [[The Man Behind the Curtain|two episodes]] in advance,&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF28&quot; /&gt; to which Monaghan felt &quot;relief&quot; for knowing the future of his job on the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF29&quot; /&gt;  On the night of Monaghan's second-to-last day on set, he was presented with a canoe paddle that had been made by the cast and crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF30&quot; /&gt;  Monaghan hoped to return to ''Lost'' as a guest star in flashbacks or dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF31&quot; /&gt;

Jack Bender stated that Matthew Fox &quot;really commits body and soul into the story he's telling&quot; and Fox questioned whether he had ever been more tired than while shooting the double episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF32&quot; /&gt;  Like the other ''Lost'' season finales, the final cliffhanger scene was given a codename—&quot;The Rattlesnake in the Mailbox&quot;—and kept top secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF33&quot; /&gt;  After Lindelof and Cuse wrote the scene, only Fox, Lilly, Bender, and co-executive producer Jean Higgins were given copies of the script.  The scene was shot with a [[green screen]] in an abandoned [[Honolulu]] parking lot with the airport edited in.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF34&quot; /&gt;  Despite the security measures, a complete and detailed episode synopsis was uploaded online over a week before the episode aired.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF35&quot; /&gt;  [[Disney]] investigated the leak.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF36&quot; /&gt;  The leak prompted Lindelof and Cuse to enter &quot;[[radio silence]]&quot;, which was temporarily broken at [[Comic-Con International]] 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF37&quot; /&gt;  The funeral parlor that Jack visits is called &quot;Hoffs/Drawlar&quot;, which is an anagram of &quot;flashforward&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF38&quot; /&gt; The idea of flashforwards was conceived by creators Lindelof and Abrams during the show's conception.&lt;ref name=&quot;kristin&quot; /&gt;  However, Cuse and Lindelof only started fleshing out the idea at the end of the first season, after they realized that flashbacks would eventually stop being revelatory and knew that they would eventually have to switch to flashforwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF39&quot; /&gt;  With the announcement that the series would conclude 48 episodes after &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF40&quot; /&gt; they felt comfortable playing flashforwards as early as the third season finale.

Post-production wrapped on May 21, 2007, only two days before it aired on television.&lt;ref name=&quot;podcast&quot;/&gt;  The score was composed by series musician [[Michael Giacchino]], while popular music was also featured throughout the episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF41&quot; /&gt;  Charlie also sings a song in the episode that was written by Dominic Monaghan, who plays him.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF42&quot; /&gt;  A ''Lost'' season finale is approximately twice as long the average ''Lost'' episode.  Due to the episode's length, it was split into two parts in [[Canada|some]] [[Brazil|countries]] and when released on DVD.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF43&quot; /&gt; Unlike most episodes, this episode did not feature a &quot;previously on ''Lost''…&quot; recap at the start of the episode when it first aired; however, it was originally preceded by a [[clip-show]] titled &quot;[[List of Lost episodes#Recaps/Specials: 2004-2008|Lost: The Answers]]&quot;, which recapped the third season.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF44&quot; /&gt;  Cuse said that he and Lindelof think the finale is &quot;very cool [and] we're very proud of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;podcast&quot;/&gt;  Stephen McPherson, the president of ABC Entertainment, called &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; &quot;one of the best episodes&quot; of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF45&quot; /&gt;  [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] released &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; on the season's DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] sets on December 11, 2007 in [[DVD region code|Region 1]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF46&quot; /&gt;  A [[featurette]] called &quot;''Lost'': On Location&quot; features cast and crew discussing production of select episodes, including &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;.  The episode was rerun for the first time on January 30, 2008 with on-screen text in the lower third of the screen, similar to [[VH1]]'s ''[[Pop-up Video]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF47&quot; /&gt;  These pop-ups were not written by ''Lost''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s writers due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]]; they were written by the marketing company Met/Hodder.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF48&quot; /&gt;  This enhanced edition was viewed by almost 9 million Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF49&quot; /&gt;

== Reception ==
=== Ratings ===

=== Critical response ===
[[Image:MatthewFox.png|thumb|upright|right|''[[BuddyTV]]'' praised Fox's lead performance as &quot;Emmy worthy&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dahl&quot;/&gt;]]

The episode garnered universal critical acclaim and is largely considered to be one of the greatest television episodes of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF56&quot;&gt;Shafrir, Doree, (May 25, 2007) &quot;[http://www.slate.com/id/2166672 ''Lost''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Leap: The Critical Buzz on the ''Lost'' Season Finale]&quot;, ''Slate''.  Retrieved on July 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the episode was &quot;an unusually action-packed and sanguinary spring cleaning that… left a host of… characters… dead&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF57&quot; /&gt; ''[[Access Atlanta]]'' said &quot;it was deeply satisfying. The first hour started a bit slow but the second hour had great twists, wonderfully emotional moments, both happy and sad&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF58&quot; /&gt; and the ''[[Associated Press]]'' said that &quot;the powerful season-ending episode redeemed the series with the shrewdness and intrigue that made it so addictive in the first place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTOREF59&quot; /&gt;  The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote that &quot;not only was the pace fast, the teases taut, and the answers plenty, the writers took a compelling gamble… [by telling] viewers that in the future… maybe all… of the people on the ''Lost'' island get off.
