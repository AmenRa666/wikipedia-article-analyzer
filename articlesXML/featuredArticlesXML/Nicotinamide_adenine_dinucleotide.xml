'''Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide''' ('''NAD''') is a [[coenzyme]] found in all living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. The compound is a dinucleotide, because it consists of two [[nucleotide]]s joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an [[adenine]] base and the other [[nicotinamide]]. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two forms, an [[redox|oxidized]] and [[redox|reduced]] form abbreviated as '''NAD{{+}}''' and '''NADH''' respectively.

In [[metabolism]], nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is involved in [[redox]] reactions, carrying [[electron]]s from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD{{+}} is an [[oxidizing agent]]&amp;nbsp;– it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes [[redox|reduced]]. This reaction forms NADH, which can then be used as a [[reducing agent]] to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] of enzymes that add or remove [[functional group|chemical groups]] from proteins, in [[posttranslational modification]]s. Because of the importance of these functions, the [[enzyme]]s involved in NAD metabolism are targets for [[drug discovery]].

In organisms, NAD can be synthesized from simple building-blocks ([[De novo synthesis|''de novo'']]) from the amino acids [[tryptophan]] or [[aspartic acid]]. In an alternative fashion, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from food as the [[vitamin]] called [[niacin]]. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles them back into the active form. Some NAD is also converted into [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme is similar to that of NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.

Although NAD{{+}} is written with a superscript plus sign because of the [[formal charge]] on a particular nitrogen atom, at physiological [[pH]] for the most part it is actually a singly charged [[anion]] (charge of minus 1), while NADH is a doubly charged anion.

==Physical and chemical properties==
{{further|Redox}}
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, like all ''dinucleotide''s, consists of two [[nucleoside]]s joined by a pair of bridging phosphate groups. The [[nucleoside]]s each contain a [[ribose]] ring, one with [[adenine]] attached to the first carbon atom (the [[Nucleic acid nomenclature|1']] position) and the other with [[nicotinamide]] at this position. The nicotinamide [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] can be attached in two orientations to this [[anomer]]ic carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two [[diastereomer]]s. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD{{+}} that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two [[phosphate]] groups through the 5' carbons.&lt;ref name=Pollak&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pollak N, Dölle C, Ziegler M | title = The power to reduce: pyridine nucleotides&amp;nbsp;– small molecules with a multitude of functions | journal = Biochem.

[[Image:NAD oxidation reduction.svg|thumb|left|250px|The [[redox]] reactions of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.]]
In metabolism, the compound accepts or donates electrons in redox reactions.&lt;ref name=Belenky&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belenky P, Bogan KL, Brenner C | title = NAD{{+}} metabolism in health and disease | journal = Trends Biochem. Sci. | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17161604 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2006.11.006 | url = http://biochem.uiowa.edu/brenner/documents/belenky07a.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reactions (summarized in formula below) involve the removal of two hydrogen atoms from the reactant (R), in the form of a [[hydride|hydride ion]] (H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and a [[proton]] (H{{+}}). The proton is released into solution, while the reductant RH{{sub|2}} is oxidized and NAD{{+}} reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the nicotinamide ring.

:RH{{sub|2}} + NAD{{+}} → NADH + H{{+}} + R;

From the hydride electron pair, one electron is transferred to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD{{+}}, and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The [[Standard electrode potential#Non-standard condition|midpoint potential]] of the NAD{{+}}/NADH redox pair is −0.32&amp;nbsp;[[volt]]s, which makes NADH a strong ''reducing'' agent.&lt;ref name=Unden&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Unden G, Bongaerts J | title = Alternative respiratory pathways of ''Escherichia coli'': energetics and transcriptional regulation in response to electron acceptors | journal = Biochim.

This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD{{+}} and NADH forms without being consumed.&lt;ref name=Pollak/&gt;

In appearance, all forms of this coenzyme are white [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] powders that are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] and highly water-soluble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Windholz, Martha |title=[[The Merck Index]]: an encyclopedia of chemicals, drugs, and biologicals |publisher=Merck |location=Rahway NJ, US |year=1983 |page=909 |isbn=0-911910-27-1 |edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark. Solutions of NAD{{+}} are colorless and stable for about a week at 4&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] and neutral [[pH]], but decompose rapidly in acids or alkalis. Upon decomposition, they form products that are [[enzyme inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Biellmann JF, Lapinte C, Haid E, Weimann G | title = Structure of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor generated from coenzyme | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 1212–7 | year = 1979 | pmid = 218616 | doi = 10.1021/bi00574a015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:NADNADH.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[ultraviolet|UV]] absorption spectra of NAD{{+}} and NADH.]]
Both NAD{{+}} and NADH strongly absorb [[ultraviolet]] light because of the adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD{{+}} is at a [[wavelength]] of 259&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer]]s (nm), with an [[Molar absorptivity|extinction coefficient]] of 16,900&amp;nbsp;[[Concentration#Molarity|M]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[[Centimetre|cm]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339&amp;nbsp;nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dawson, R. Ben |title=Data for biochemical research |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1985 |page=122 |isbn=0-19-855358-7 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in the ultraviolet [[absorption spectra]] between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in [[enzyme assay]]s&amp;nbsp;– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340&amp;nbsp;nm using a [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometer]].&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt;

NAD{{+}} and NADH also differ in their [[fluorescence]]. NADH in solution has an emission peak at 460&amp;nbsp;nm and a [[Fluorescence#Lifetime|fluorescence lifetime]] of 0.4&amp;nbsp;[[nanosecond]]s, while the oxidized form of the coenzyme does not fluoresce.&lt;ref name=Lakowicz&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lakowicz JR, Szmacinski H, Nowaczyk K, Johnson ML | title = Fluorescence lifetime imaging of free and protein-bound NADH | journal = Proc.

==Concentration and state in cells==
In rat liver, the total amount of NAD{{+}} and NADH is approximately 1&amp;nbsp;[[micromole|μmole]] per [[gram]] of wet weight, about 10 times the concentration of NADP{{+}} and NADPH in the same cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reiss PD, Zuurendonk PF, Veech RL | title = Measurement of tissue purine, pyrimidine, and other nucleotides by radial compression high-performance liquid chromatography | journal = Anal.

Data for other compartments in the cell are limited, although, in the [[mitochondrion]] the concentration of NAD{{+}} is similar to that in the cytosol.&lt;ref name=Yang/&gt; This NAD{{+}} is carried into the mitochondrion by a specific [[membrane transport protein]], since the coenzyme cannot [[diffusion|diffuse]] across membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Todisco S, Agrimi G, Castegna A, Palmieri F | title = Identification of the mitochondrial NAD{{+}} transporter in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' | journal = J.

The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD{{+}}/NADH ratio. This ratio is an important component of what is called the ''redox state'' of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schafer FQ, Buettner GR | title = Redox environment of the cell as viewed through the redox state of the glutathione disulfide/glutathione couple | journal = Free Radic Biol Med | volume = 30 | issue = 11 | pages = 1191–212 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11368918 | doi = 10.1016/S0891-5849(01)00480-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of the NAD{{+}}/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase]] and [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD{{+}} and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions.&lt;ref name=Williamson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williamson DH, Lund P, Krebs HA | title = The redox state of free nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of rat liver | journal = Biochem.

==Biosynthesis==
NAD{{+}} is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a ''[[De novo synthesis|de novo]]'' pathway from [[amino acid]]s or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as [[nicotinamide]] back to NAD{{+}}.

Most organisms synthesize NAD{{+}} from simple components.&lt;ref name=Belenky/&gt; The specific set of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of [[quinolinic acid]] (QA) from an amino acid—either [[tryptophan]] (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or [[aspartic acid]] in some bacteria and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katoh A, Uenohara K, Akita M, Hashimoto T | title = Early Steps in the Biosynthesis of NAD in Arabidopsis Start with Aspartate and Occur in the Plastid | journal = Plant Physiol. | volume = 141 | issue = 3 | pages = 851–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16698895 | pmc = 1489895 | doi = 10.1104/pp.106.081091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foster JW, Moat AG | title = Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis and pyridine nucleotide cycle metabolism in microbial systems | journal = Microbiol.

Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is [[amide|amidated]] to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.&lt;ref name=Belenky/&gt;

[[Image:NA, N and NR.svg|thumb|left|300px|Salvage pathways use three precursors for NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.]]

===Salvage pathways===
Besides assembling NAD{{+}} ''de novo'' from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base. The three vitamin precursors used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) and [[nicotinamide riboside]] (NR).&lt;ref name=Belenky/&gt; These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B{{sub|3}} or ''[[niacin]]''. However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD{{+}}. Some of the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the [[cell nucleus]], which may compensate for the high level of reactions that consume NAD{{+}} in this [[organelle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson RM, Bitterman KJ, Wood JG, Medvedik O, Cohen H, Lin SS, Manchester JK, Gordon JI, Sinclair DA | title = Manipulation of a nuclear NAD{{+}} salvage pathway delays aging without altering steady-state NAD{{+}} levels | journal = J.

Despite the presence of the ''de novo'' pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the [[vitamin deficiency]] disease [[pellagra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Henderson LM | title = Niacin | journal = Annu.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has several essential roles in [[metabolism]]. It acts as a [[coenzyme]] in [[redox]] reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in [[ADP-ribosylation]] reactions, as a precursor of the [[second messenger system|second messenger]] molecule [[cyclic ADP-ribose]], as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial [[DNA ligase]]s and a group of enzymes called [[sirtuin]]s that use NAD{{+}} to remove [[acetyl|acetyl groups]] from proteins.

===Oxidoreductase binding of NAD===
{{further|Protein structure|Oxidoreductase}}

The main role of NAD{{+}} in metabolism is the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called [[oxidoreductase]]s. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example [[NADH dehydrogenase|NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase]] catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by [[coenzyme Q]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme | title = Enzyme Nomenclature, Recommendations for enzyme names from the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | accessdate = 2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these enzymes are also referred to as ''dehydrogenases'' or ''reductases'', with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called ''NADH dehydrogenase'' or sometimes ''coenzyme Q reductase''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.expasy.org/enzyme/1.6.5.3 |title=NiceZyme View of ENZYME: EC 1.6.5.3 |accessdate=2007-12-16 |publisher=Expasy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When bound to a protein, NAD{{+}} and NADH are usually held within a [[structural motif]] known as the [[Rossmann fold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lesk AM | title = NAD-binding domains of dehydrogenases | journal = Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 775–83 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8749365 | doi = 10.1016/0959-440X(95)80010-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif is named after [[Michael Rossmann]] who was the first scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins.&lt;ref name=Rao&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao ST, Rossmann MG | title = Comparison of super-secondary structures in proteins | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 241–56 | year = 1973 | pmid = 4737475 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(73)90388-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fold contains three or more parallel [[beta sheet|beta strands]] linked by two [[alpha helix|alpha helices]] in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide, binding domains for NAD{{+}} consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each fold binding one of the two nucleotides of the cofactor.&lt;ref name=Rao/&gt; However, this fold is not universal among NAD-dependent enzymes, since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in [[amino acid]] metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme, but lack this motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goto M, Muramatsu H, Mihara H, Kurihara T, Esaki N, Omi R, Miyahara I, Hirotsu K | title = Crystal structures of Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate/Delta1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase belonging to a new family of NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases: conformational change, substrate recognition, and stereochemistry of the reaction | journal = J.

[[File:NAD+ phys alt.svg|thumb|left|In this diagram, the hydride acceptor C4 carbon is shown at the top. When the nicotinamide ring lies in the plane of the page with the carboxy-amide to the right, as shown, the hydride donor lies either &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; the plane of the page. If &quot;above&quot; hydride transfer is class A, if &quot;below&quot; hydride transfer is class B.&lt;ref name=bellamacina/&gt;]]

When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase, the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate. Depending on the enzyme, the hydride donor is positioned either &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; the plane of the planar C4 carbon, as defined in the figure. Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above; class B enzymes transfer it from below. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is [[prochiral]], this can be exploited in [[enzyme kinetics]] to give information about the enzyme's mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has [[deuterium]] atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD{{+}} by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen. In this case, an enzyme can produce one of two [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomer]]s of NADH.&lt;ref name=bellamacina&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bellamacina CR | title = The nicotinamide dinucleotide binding motif: a comparison of nucleotide binding proteins | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 1257–69 | date = 1 September 1996 | pmid = 8836039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the similarity in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show a high level of specificity for either NAD{{+}} or NADP{{+}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carugo O, Argos P | title = NADP-dependent enzymes. I: Conserved stereochemistry of cofactor binding | journal = Proteins | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–28 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9144787 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(199705)28:1&lt;10::AID-PROT2&gt;3.0.CO;2-N }}&lt;/ref&gt; This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of [[amino acid]] residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an [[ionic bond]] is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP{{+}}. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP{{+}} from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as [[aldose reductase]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and [[methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase]] can use both coenzymes in some species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vickers TJ, Orsomando G, de la Garza RD, Scott DA, Kang SO, Hanson AD, Beverley SM | title = Biochemical and genetic analysis of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in Leishmania metabolism and virulence | journal = J.

===Role in redox metabolism===
[[Image:Catabolism schematic.svg|thumb|250px|A simplified outline of redox [[metabolism]], showing how NAD{{+}} and NADH link the [[citric acid cycle]] and [[oxidative phosphorylation]].]]

{{further|Cellular respiration|Oxidative phosphorylation}}

The redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases are vital in all parts of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as [[glucose]] and [[fatty acids]] are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD{{+}} by reduction to NADH, as part of [[beta oxidation]], [[glycolysis]], and the [[citric acid cycle]]. In [[eukaryote]]s the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the [[cytoplasm]] are transferred into the [[mitochondrion]] (to reduce mitochondrial NAD{{+}}) by [[mitochondrial shuttle]]s, such as the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bakker BM, Overkamp KM, Kötter P, Luttik MA, Pronk JT | title = Stoichiometry and compartmentation of NADH metabolism in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' | journal = FEMS Microbiol. Rev. | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–37 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11152939 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2001.tb00570.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in turn by the [[electron transport chain]], which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rich PR | title = The molecular machinery of Keilin's respiratory chain | journal = Biochem. Soc. Trans. | volume = 31 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1095–105 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14641005 | doi = 10.1042/BST0311095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in [[chloroplast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heineke D, Riens B, Grosse H, Hoferichter P, Peter U, Flügge UI, Heldt HW | title = Redox Transfer across the Inner Chloroplast Envelope Membrane | journal = Plant Physiol | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 1131–1137 | year = 1991 | pmid = 16668101 | pmc = 1077662 | doi = 10.1104/pp.95.4.1131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since both the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD{{+}} and NADH, with the high NAD{{+}}/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent.&lt;ref name=Nicholls&gt;{{Cite book|author=Nicholls DG|author2=Ferguson SJ |title=Bioenergetics 3 |edition=1st|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002 |isbn=0-12-518121-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in [[anabolism]], with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as [[fatty acid synthesis]] and [[photosynthesis]]. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP{{+}}/NADPH ratio is kept very low.&lt;ref name=Nicholls/&gt;

Although it is important in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as [[gluconeogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sistare FD, Haynes RC | title = The interaction between the cytosolic pyridine nucleotide redox potential and gluconeogenesis from lactate/pyruvate in isolated rat hepatocytes.

For example, [[nitrification|nitrifying]] bacteria such as ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Freitag A, Bock E |year=1990 |title=Energy conservation in ''Nitrobacter'' |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters |volume=66 |issue=1–3 |pages=157–62 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.1990.tb03989.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a [[nitrite oxidoreductase]] to produce enough [[chemiosmosis|proton-motive force]] to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Starkenburg SR, Chain PS, Sayavedra-Soto LA, Hauser L, Land ML, Larimer FW, Malfatti SA, Klotz MG, Bottomley PJ, Arp DJ, Hickey WJ | title = Genome Sequence of the Chemolithoautotrophic Nitrite-Oxidizing Bacterium ''Nitrobacter winogradskyi'' Nb-255 | journal = Appl.

===Non-redox roles===
The coenzyme NAD{{+}} is also consumed in ADP-ribose transfer reactions.

NAD{{+}} is also consumed by [[sirtuin]]s, which are NAD-dependent [[Histone deacetylase|deacetylases]], such as [[Sir2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=North BJ, Verdin E | title = Sirtuins: Sir2-related NAD-dependent protein deacetylases | journal = Genome Biol | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | page = 224 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15128440 | pmc = 416462 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2004-5-5-224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes act by transferring an [[acetyl]] group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD{{+}}; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly seem to be involved in regulating [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] through deacetylating histones and altering [[nucleosome]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blander G, Guarente L | title = The Sir2 family of protein deacetylases | journal = Annu.

Other NAD-dependent enzymes include bacterial [[DNA ligase]]s, which join two DNA ends by using NAD{{+}} as a substrate to donate an [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new [[phosphodiester bond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilkinson A, Day J, Bowater R | title = Bacterial DNA ligases | journal = Mol.

NAD{{+}} is also a direct target of the drug [[isoniazid]], which is used in the treatment of [[tuberculosis]], an infection caused by ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.
