[[File:Meadowgold.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Meadow Gold sign has greeted Route 66 travelers in Tulsa for decades.]]

The area where Tulsa now exists was considered [[Indian Territory]] when it was first formally settled by the Lochapoka / Creek tribes in 1836.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa Area History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsalibrary.org/tulsahistory/communities.htm#tul | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108010448/http://www.tulsalibrary.org/tulsahistory/communities.htm#tul | archivedate=January 8, 2007| title=Tulsa Area History |publisher=Tulsa County Library| accessdate=April 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established a small settlement under the [[Creek Council Oak Tree]] at the present day intersection of Cheyenne Avenue and 18th Street.  This area and this tree reminded Chief Tukabahchi and his small group of trail of tear survivors of the bend in the river and their previous Creek Council Oak Tree back in  the Talisi, Alabama area. They named their new settlement ''Tallasi'', meaning &quot;old town&quot; in the Creek language, which later became &quot;Tulsa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa Area History&quot; /&gt; The area around Tulsa was also settled by members of the other so-called &quot;[[Five Civilized Tribes]]&quot; who had relocated to Oklahoma from the Southern United States; most of modern Tulsa is located in the Creek Nation, with parts located in the [[Cherokee Nation]] and [[Osage Nation]].

Although Oklahoma was not yet a state during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the Tulsa area did see its share of fighting.  The [[Battle of Chusto-Talasah]] took place on the north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties.  After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction treaties with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary [[Wild Bunch]], the [[Dalton Gang]], and [[Little Britches (outlaw)|Little Britches]].

===Incorporation and &quot;Oil Capital&quot; prosperity===
On January 18, 1898, Tulsa was officially incorporated and elected its first mayor, Edward Calkins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa County History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Jeff | last=Smith | date=September 15, 2005 | url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~oktulsa/history.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019033624/http://rootsweb.com/~oktulsa/history.htm | archivedate=October 19, 2007| title=Tulsa County History |publisher=Roots Web| accessdate=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tulsa was a small town near the banks of the Arkansas River in 1901 when its first oil well, named Sue Bland No. 1,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa County History&quot; /&gt; was established. Much of the oil was discovered on land whose mineral rights were owned by members of the [[Osage Nation]] under a system of headrights. By 1905, the discovery of the large Glenn Pool (located approximately 15 miles south of downtown Tulsa and site of the present-day town of [[Glenpool, Oklahoma|Glenpool]]) prompted a rush of entrepreneurs to the area's growing number of oil fields; Tulsa's population swelled to over 140,000 between 1901 and 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=June 1998 | url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html | title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990| first=Campbell | last=Gibson| accessdate=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1909, seven years after the discovery of oil in the area, Tulsa's population had sprouted to 180,000. Unlike the early settlers of Northeastern Oklahoma, who most frequently migrated from the South and Texas, many of these new oil-driven settlers came to Tulsa from the commercial centers of the East Coast and lower Midwest.  This migration distinguished the city's demographics from neighboring communities (Tulsa has larger and more prominent Catholic and Jewish populations than most Oklahoma cities) and is reflected in the designs of early Tulsa's upscale neighborhoods.

Known as the &quot;Oil Capital of the World&quot; for most of the 20th century, the city's success in the energy industry prompted construction booms in the popular [[Art Deco]] style of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa History&quot; /&gt; Profits from the oil industry continued through the [[Great Depression]], helping the city's economy fare better than most in the United States during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco in Tulsa&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsalibrary.org/research/artdeco/artdecointulsa.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202031937/http://www.tulsalibrary.org/research/artdeco/artdecointulsa.htm | archivedate=December 2, 2006| title=What's Doing in Tulsa?| first=Rex | last=Ball |author2=Jennifer Young | publisher=Tulsa City-County Library | accessdate=April 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, Tulsa was home to the &quot;[[Greenwood (Tulsa)#The Black Wall Street|Black Wall Street]]&quot;, one of the most prosperous black communities in the United States at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa Race Riot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsareparations.org/TulsaRiot.htm |title=The Tulsa Race Riot |first=Scott |last=Ellsworth |publisher=Tulsa Reparations |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210225357/http://www.tulsareparations.org/TulsaRiot.htm |archivedate=December 10, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood]] neighborhood, it was the site of the [[Tulsa Race Riot]], one of the nation's worst acts of racial violence and civil disorder, with whites attacking blacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa Race Riot&quot; /&gt; Sixteen hours of rioting on May 31 and June 1, 1921, was only ended when National Guardsmen were brought in by the Governor. An official report later claimed that 23 black and 16 white citizens were killed, but other estimates suggest as many as 300 people died, most of them black.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa Race Riot&quot; /&gt;  Over 800 people were admitted to local hospitals with injuries, and an estimated 10,000 people were left homeless as 35 city blocks, composed of 1,256 residences, were destroyed by fire.

In 1925, Tulsa businessman [[Cyrus Avery]], known as the &quot;Father of [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/carney/avery.html | title=The Father of Route 66 | publisher=[[University of Virginia]] | accessdate=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; began his campaign to create a road linking [[Chicago]] to [[Los Angeles]] by establishing the [[U.S. Highway 66 Association]] in Tulsa, earning the city the nickname the &quot;Birthplace of Route 66&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Birthplace of Route 66: Tulsa, OK| url = http://www.citydictionary.com/OK/Tulsa/Birthplace-of-Route-66/5485/| date = Jun 22, 2009| accessdate = July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once completed, U.S. Route 66 took an important role in Tulsa's development as the city served as a popular rest stop for travelers, who were greeted by Route 66 icons such as the Meadow Gold Sign and the [[Blue Whale of Catoosa]]. During this period, [[Bob Wills]] and his group, [[The Texas Playboys]], began their long performing stint at a small ballroom in downtown Tulsa. In 1935, [[Cain's Ballroom]] became the base for the group,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain's Ballroom&quot; /&gt; which is largely credited for creating Western Swing music. The venue continued to attract famous musicians through its history, and is still in operation today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain's Ballroom&quot; /&gt;

For the remainder of the mid-20th century, the city had a master plan to construct parks, churches, museums, rose gardens, improved infrastructure, and increased national advertising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa History&quot; /&gt; The [[Spavinaw Water Project|Spavinaw Dam]], built during this era to accommodate the city's water needs, was considered one of the largest public works projects of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsaweb.com/tulhist.htm| title=Tulsa's History | publisher=Tulsa Web | accessdate=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, ''[[Time magazine]]'' dubbed Tulsa as &quot;America's Most Beautiful City.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa History&quot; /&gt;

A national recession greatly affected the city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma heavily dependent on oil suffered the [[1980s oil glut|freefall in gas prices]] due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oil Bust&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date=January 23, 2006 | url=http://staging.okcommerce.gov/test1/dmdocuments/Oklahoma_Oil_Gas_Briefing_January_2006_0302061746.pdf| title=Oil and Gas Briefing| format=PDF | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Commerce | accessdate=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, was one of the hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oil Bust&quot; /&gt; By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oil Bust&quot; /&gt; but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.

===Tulsa in the twenty-first century===
In 2003, the &quot;[[Vision 2025]]&quot; program was approved by voters, to enhance and revitalize Tulsa's infrastructure and tourism industry. The keystone project of the initiative, the [[BOK Center]], was designed to be a home for the city's minor league hockey and arena football teams, as well as a venue for major concerts and conventions. The multi-purpose arena, designed by famed architect [[Cesar Pelli]], broke ground in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ww3.visittulsa.com/general.asp?id=207 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509145415/http://ww3.visittulsa.com/general.asp?id=207 | archivedate=May 9, 2007| title=BOK Center| publisher=Tulsa Convention and Visitors Bureau | accessdate=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was opened on August 30, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080830_11_Ente266423 &quot;Opening of BOK Center draws thousands downtown,&quot;] ''[[Tulsa World]]'', August 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tulsa satellite poster edit1.jpg|thumb|upright|As seen from space, most of Tulsa lies east of the Arkansas River.]]

Tulsa is located in the northeastern corner of Oklahoma, {{convert|99|mi|km}} northeast of [[Oklahoma City]]; situated between the edge of the [[Great Plains]] and the foot of [[the Ozarks]] in a generally forested region of rolling hills. The city touches the eastern extent of the [[Cross Timbers]], an [[ecoregion]] of [[forest]] and [[prairie]] transitioning from the drier plains of the west to the wetter forests of the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uark.edu/misc/xtimber/summary.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908090043/http://www.uark.edu/misc/xtimber/summary.html | archivedate=September 8, 2006 | publisher=[[University of Arkansas]]| title=The Ancient Cross Timbers| accessdate=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a wetter climate than points westward, Tulsa serves as a gateway to &quot;[[Green Country]]&quot;, a popular and official designation for northeast Oklahoma that stems from the region's green vegetation and relatively large number of hills and lakes compared to central and western areas of Oklahoma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Leah | last=Clapman | title=Key Races: Oklahoma Senate | date=September 24, 2004 | publisher=PBS | url = http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/key-races/ok_profile.html | accessdate = April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which lie largely in the drier Great Plains region of the Central United States. Located near the western edge of the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]], northeastern Oklahoma is the most topographically diverse part of the state, containing seven of Oklahoma's 11 eco-regions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.travelok.com/atv/index.asp#map | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism | title=Oklahoma, The All-Terrain Vacation | accessdate=April 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than half of its state parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.travelok.com/cities/regions.asp?region=G42.G4084 | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism | title=Northeast Oklahoma's Green Country | accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region encompasses 30 lakes or reservoirs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greencountryok.com/browse.php?type=6| publisher=Green Country Marketing Association | title=Northeast Oklahoma Lakes | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and borders the neighboring states of [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]. The [[geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] of the city of Tulsa are {{Coord|36|7|53|N|95|56|14|W|type:city}} (36.131294, −95.937332),&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an elevation of {{convert|700|ft}} above sea level.

===Topography===
The city developed on both sides of the prominent Arkansas River, which flows in a wide, sandy-bottomed channel. Its flow through the Tulsa area is controlled by upstream [[Keystone Lake|flood control reservoirs]], but its width and depth can vary widely throughout the year, such as during periods of high rainfall or severe drought. A low-water dam maintains a full channel at all times in the area adjacent to downtown Tulsa. This portion of the river is known as Zink Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm15020.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16063coll1/id/1681|title=Low-water dam lake to honor Zinks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Gretchen | last=Collins | title=River Parks Proves Practical Need for Visionary Ideas | publisher=Urban Tulsa Weekly | url = http://archives.urbantulsa.com/article.asp?id=11 | accessdate = April 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063005/http://archives.urbantulsa.com/article.asp?id=11 |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavily wooded and with abundant parks and water areas, the city has several prominent hills, such as &quot;Shadow Mountain&quot; and &quot;Turkey Mountain&quot;, which create varied terrain, especially in its southern portions. While its central and northern sections are generally flat to gently undulating, the [[Osage Hills]] extension into the northwestern part of the city further varies the landscape. Holmes Peak, north of the city, is the tallest point in the [[Tulsa metro area|Tulsa Metro area]] at 1360&amp;nbsp;ft (415&amp;nbsp;m)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=22429 |title=Osage County High Point |publisher=Peakbagger.com |date=November 1, 2004 |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|186.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|182.6|sqmi}} of it is land and {{convert|4.2|sqmi}} of it (2.24%) is water.

[[File:Philtower in Tulsa.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Philtower]], built in the late Gothic Revival style, is surrounded by contemporary office buildings.]]

A building boom in the early 20th century gave Tulsa one of the largest concentrations of art deco architecture in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsadowntown.org/index.cfm?pageID=13&amp;pageParentIDNew=1 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502144457/http://www.tulsadowntown.org/index.cfm?pageID=13&amp;pageParentIDNew=1 | archivedate=May 2, 2007| title=Tulsa Historical Background | publisher=Downtown Tulsa Unlimited | accessdate=April 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly in the zigzag and [[Streamline Moderne|streamline]] styles,&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco in Tulsa&quot; /&gt; the city's art deco is dotted throughout its older neighborhoods, primarily in downtown and midtown. A collection of large art deco structures such as the [[Mid-Continent Tower]], the [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]], and the [[Philtower]], have attracted events promoting preservation and architectural interest. In 2001, Tulsa served as the host city for the International Art Deco Congress, a semiannual event designed to promote art deco architecture internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Deco Congress&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artdecobrasil.com/apresentacao.ppt |title=International Art Deco Congress |publisher=artdecobrasil.com |accessdate=August 7, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the city's early prosperity funded the construction of a number of elegant Craftsman, Georgian, storybook, Tudor, Greek Revival, Italianate, Spanish revival, and colonial revival homes (many of which can be found in Tulsa's uptown and Midtown neighborhoods).

Building booms in later half of the twentieth century gave the city a larger base of contemporary architectural styles, including a number of buildings by famed architect [[Bruce Goff]], who lived in Tulsa. South, East and Midtown tulsa are also home to a number of ranch and Mid-Century Modern homes that reflect Tulsa's prosperous post-war period.

The [[BOK Tower]], built during this period, is the 2nd tallest building in Oklahoma and the surrounding states of Missouri, [[New Mexico]], [[Arkansas]], and Kansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tallest Buildings by U.S. State&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date=October 6, 2006 | url=http://www.allaboutskyscrapers.com/tallest_state.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111140434/http://www.allaboutskyscrapers.com/tallest_state.html | archivedate=January 11, 2007| title=Tallest Buildings by U.S. State | first=Richie | last=Gill | publisher=All About Skyscrapers| accessdate=April 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulsa also has the third-, and fourth-tallest buildings in the state, including the [[Cityplex Towers|Cityplex Tower]], which is located in South Tulsa across from Oral Roberts University, far from downtown.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Oklahoma&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2007 | url=http://www.travelok.com/about/fun_facts.asp| title=About Oklahoma | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation| accessdate=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the area's unique architectural complexes, Oral Roberts University, is built in a [[Futurist architecture|Post-Modern Futuristic]] style, incorporating bright gold structures with sharp, jetting edges and clear geometric shapes.

[[File:Tulsa, Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Arkansas River]] marks the division between West Tulsa and other regions of the city.]]

The city's historical residential core lies in an area known as Midtown, containing upscale neighborhoods built in the early 20th century with architecture ranging from art deco to [[Greek Revival]]. The University of Tulsa, the [[Swan Lake (Tulsa)|Swan Lake]] neighborhood, [[Philbrook Museum]], and the upscale shopping districts of [[Utica Square]], Cherry Street, and Brookside are located in this region. A large portion of the city's southern half has developed since the 1970s, containing low density housing and retail developments. This region, marked by secluded homes and suburban neighborhoods, contains one of the state's largest shopping malls, [[Woodland Hills Mall]], as well as [[Southern Hills Country Club]], and Oral Roberts University. East of Highway 169 and north of 61st street, a diverse racial makeup marks the eastern portions of the city, with large [[Asian people|Asian]] and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] communities and much of the city's manufacturing industry.

Areas of Tulsa west of the Arkansas River are called [[West Tulsa]], and are marked by large parks, wilderness reserves, and large oil refineries. The northern tier of the city is home to [[OSU-Tulsa]], [[Gilcrease Museum]], [[Tulsa International Airport]], the [[Tulsa Zoo]], the [[Tulsa Air and Space Museum]], and the nation's third-largest municipal park, Mohawk Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mowhawk Park - 3rd Largest&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tulsazoo.org/general.asp?id=97| title=Zoo History | publisher=[[Tulsa Zoo and Living Museum]] | accessdate=April 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan area===
[[File:Tulsa Metro.svg|thumb|right|The Tulsa MSA's location (red) in the state of Oklahoma with the Tulsa-Bartlesville CSA (pink)]]
{{Main article|Tulsa Metropolitan Area}}
The Tulsa [[Metropolitan Area]], or the region immediately surrounding Tulsa with strong social and economic ties to the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_metro.htm| title=State and County Quickfacts – Metropolitan Statistical Area | publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=July 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; occupies a large portion of the state's northeastern quadrant. It is informally known as &quot;[[Green Country]]&quot;, a longstanding name adopted the state's official tourism designation for all of northeastern Oklahoma (its usage in relation to the Tulsa Metropolitan Area can be traced to the early part of the 20th century).&lt;ref name=&quot;Green Country Reborn&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date=September 15, 2003 |url=http://www.tulsatoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=421&amp;Itemid=2 | title=Vision of the Future Now, Part 3| first=David | last=Arnett | publisher=Tulsa Today | accessdate=April 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] defines the sphere of the city's influence as the Tulsa [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), spanning seven counties: Tulsa, [[Rogers County, Oklahoma|Rogers]], Osage, Wagoner, [[Okmulgee County, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]], [[Pawnee County, Oklahoma|Pawnee]], and [[Creek County, Oklahoma|Creek]]. The 2015 U.S. Census estimate shows the Tulsa MSA to have 981,005 residents&lt;ref name=&quot;metropop13&quot;/&gt; In 2015, U.S. Census estimates show the Tulsa-Muscogee-Bartlesville CMSA to have 1,151,172 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oklahomastudiosearch.com/tulsaapartments.htm|title=Oklahoma Apartments in Oklahoma|publisher=Oklahoma Apartments|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metro growth nearing 7 digits&quot;&gt;{{cite news|date=April 5, 2007|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=070405_1_A1_hThes35833|title=Metro Area growth nearing 7 digits|first=Leigh|last= Bell|publisher=Tulsa World|accessdate=April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===

Tulsa has a rich and diverse religious history, with notable and culturally significant communities of Christians, Jews, Muslims and others.

Tulsa is part of the Southern region demographers and commentators refer to as the &quot;[[Bible Belt]],&quot; where Protestant and, in particular, [[Southern Baptist]] and Evangelical Christian traditions are very prominent. In fact, Tulsa,  home to [[Oral Roberts University]], is sometimes called the &quot;[[Bible Belt#Buckle|buckle of the Bible Belt]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newvoices.org/cgi-bin/articlepage.cgi?id=672 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121104922/http://www.newvoices.org/cgi-bin/articlepage.cgi?id=672 | archivedate=January 21, 2007 | title=Jewish Life in the Bible Belt| first=Thursday | last=Bram | publisher=New Voices Magazine| accessdate=August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=April 29, 2007 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-162762471.html |title=Minister's book plunges into cultural issues |first=Bill |last=Sherman |work=Tulsa World |accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond [[Oral Roberts]], number of prominent Protestant Christians have lived or studied in Tulsa, including [[Joel Osteen]], [[Carlton Pearson]], [[Kenneth Copeland]], [[Billy Joe Daugherty]], [[Smokie Norful]] and [[Billy James Hargis]]. Tulsa is also home to a number of vibrant [[Mainline Protestant]] congregations. Some of these congregations were founded during the oil boom of the early twentieth century and are noted for their architecture (such as the art deco [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]] and [[First Presbyterian Church (Tulsa)|First Presbyterian Church of Tulsa]]).

While the state of Oklahoma has fewer Roman Catholics than the national average,&lt;ref name=&quot;religion2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://religions.pewforum.org/maps | title=U.S. Religious Landscapes Survey| publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion and Life| accessdate=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulsa has a higher percentage owing in large part to the influx of Eastern and Midwestern settlers during the oil boom.  Tulsa's Catholic community is atypically prominent for a Southern city and includes Governor and U.S. Senator [[Dewey F. Bartlett]], Congressmen [[James Robert Jones]] and [[John A. Sullivan]], Governor [[Frank Keating]], U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See [[Francis Rooney]], and Mayors [[Dewey F. Bartlett, Jr.]], [[Robert J. LaFortune]], [[Bill LaFortune]] and [[G. T. Bynum]].  [[Holy Family Cathedral in Tulsa|Holy Family Cathedral]] serves as the Cathedral for the  Diocese of Tulsa.

Tulsa is also home to the largest Jewish community in Oklahoma, with active Reform, Conservative and Orthodox congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shevitz|first1=Amy Hill|title=Jews|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JE009|website=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulsa's Jewish community includes several of America's most generous philanthropists including [[George Kaiser]] and [[Lynn Schusterman]]. Tulsa's [[Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art]] offers the largest collection of Judaica in the South-Central and Southwestern United States.

Tulsa is also home to the progressive [[All Souls Unitarian Church]], reportedly the largest [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregation in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;&gt;Kimberly French, [http://www.uuworld.org/life/articles/145503.shtml &quot;The gospel of inclusion: A black Pentecostal bishop embraces Universalism, befriends a Unitarian minister, and shakes up the largest congregation in the UUA.&quot;] ''UU World'', Fall 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Madison&quot;&gt;[http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/madison.com/html/archive_files/wsj/2003/12/26/0312250065.php &quot;Biggest in the U.S.: That Now Describes The First Unitarian Society Of Madison, And In 15 Years It Has Doubled To 1,300 Members&quot;], ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'', December 26, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://swuuc.org/pages/about-us/our-history.php &quot;A Brief History of the Southwestern Unitarian Universalist Conference&quot;] at Southwestern Unitarian Universalist Conference website (retrieved July 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The BOK Building.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The BOK Tower serves as the world headquarters for Williams Companies.]]

===Energy industry's legacy and resurgence===
Traditionally, Tulsa's economy has been led by the energy industry.  The [[United States Oil and Gas Association]], formerly the '''Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association''', was founded in Tulsa on October 13, 1917, six months after the entry of the United States into [[World War I]]. At the time Tulsa called itself &quot;The Oil Capital of the World&quot;. At its creation, the association worked to provide [[petroleum]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces. In the decades since its establishment, the association is recognized as a leading advocate for producers of domestic oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://www.usoga.org/en/about_us/history/|title=A Brief History|publisher=usoga.org|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the city's history many large oil companies have been headquartered in the city, including Warren Petroleum (which merged with [[Gulf Oil]] in what was then the largest merger in the energy industry), [[Skelly Oil]], [[Getty Oil]] and [[CITGO]]. In addition, [[ConocoPhillips]] was headquartered in nearby Bartlesville. Industry consolidation and increased offshore drilling threatened Tulsa's status as an oil capital, but new drilling techniques and the rise of natural gas has buoyed the growth of the city's energy sector.

Today, Tulsa is again home to the headquarters of many international oil and gas-related companies, including [[Williams Companies]], [[SemGroup]], [[ONE Gas]], [[Syntroleum]], [[ONEOK]], [[Laredo Petroleum]], [[Samson Resources]], [[Helmerich &amp; Payne]], [[Magellan Midstream Partners]], [[WPX Energy]], and Excel Energy.

===Diversification and emerging industries===
Tulsa has diversified to capitalize on its status as a regional hub with substantial innovation assets. Products from Tulsa manufacturers account for about 60% of Oklahoma's exports,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobs&quot; /&gt; and in 2001, the city's total [[GDP|gross product]] was in the top one-third of metropolitan areas, states, and countries, with more than {{Nowrap|$29 billion}} in total goods, growing at a rate of {{Nowrap|$250 million}} each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Do Business in Tulsa&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2007 | url=http://ww3.tulsachamber.com/general.asp?id=22 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720005215/http://ww3.tulsachamber.com/general.asp?id=22 | archivedate=July 20, 2007| title=About Tulsa | publisher=Tulsa Metro Chamber | accessdate=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Forbes magazine rated Tulsa as second in the nation in income growth, and one of the best cities in the country to do business with.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbestop50&quot;&gt;{{cite news | year=2006 | url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/1/2813.html | title=Tulsa, OK: Best Places to do Business 2006 |work=Forbes Magazine | accessdate=July 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually among the lowest in the nation in terms of cost of doing business, the Tulsa Metropolitan Area in 2005 was rated among the five lowest metropolitan areas in the United States for that category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tulsa: Economic Profile and Forecast&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2005 | url=http://ww3.tulsachamber.com/upload/Economic%20Profile%20and%20Forecast.pdf | title=Economic Profile and Forecast| format=PDF | publisher=Tulsa Metro Chamber | page=3 |accessdate=April 14, 2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tulsa Cuisine==
Tulsa restaurants and food trucks offer a number of cuisines, but several cuisines are particularly prominent in Tulsa's culinary landscape owing to its distinctive history.

===BBQ===
Tulsa is known nationally for its barbecue offerings; its barbecue reflects its midpoint location &quot;between pig country and cow country,&quot; that is, on the border of the South and the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martino|first1=Justin|title=The Heartland of BBQ|url=http://www.okmag.com/blog/2016/05/26/the-heartland-of-bbq/|accessdate=14 August 2016|work=Oklahoma Magazine|date=26 May 2016|quote=“We’re right in the heartland,” says Nick Corcoran, pit master at Burn Co. Barbeque in Tulsa. “We’re right between pig country and cow country, so we get the best of both worlds. We’re also right between Kansas and Texas, two known barbecue meccas as well, so we get a melding of those two pots.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's barbecue is also helped by its geography; the wood used in barbecuing is abundant in Northeastern Oklahoma (including [[pecan]], [[oak]], [[hickory]], [[mesquite]] and [[maple]]). The region's ethnic diversity is felt, too: its BBQ traditions bear the influences of white, African-American and American Indian foodways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Linda D.|title=Barbecue|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=BARBECUE|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tulsa is also home to the nationally acclaimed premium smoker manufacturer Hasty-Bake Company. Some Tulsa based barbecue joints have expanded even beyond the state's borders, including [[Rib Crib]] and [[Billy Sims Barbecue]].  The prize-winning [[Oklahoma Joe's]] was founded by Oklahoman Joe Davidson, who mastered his craft at Tulsa's T-Town BBQ Cook-Off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vaughn|first1=Daniel|url=http://www.tmbbq.com/interview-joe-davidson-of-oklahoma-joes-bar-b-cue/|title=Texas Monthly BBQ|accessdate=14 August 2016|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oklahoma barbecue is also unique in its emphasis on hickory-smoked baloney, nicknamed &quot;Oklahoma tenderloin&quot; and its fried okra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Ardie|title=Barbecue ‘Oklahoma Tenderloin’ hard to find in KC — that’s no baloney|url=http://www.kansascity.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/chow-town/article337138/Barbecue-%E2%80%98Oklahoma-Tenderloin%E2%80%99-hard-to-find-in-KC-%E2%80%94-that%E2%80%99s-no-baloney.html|accessdate=17 August 2016|work=The Kansas City Star|date=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanese Steakhouses===
Lebanese steakhouses were once numerous in the region stretching from [[Bristow, Oklahoma]] to Tulsa, but now mostly exist in the Tulsa region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schallner|first1=Nancy|title=Lebanese Steakhouses|url=http://www.tulsagal.net/2010/09/lebanese-steakhouses.html|website=Tulsa Gal|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These restaurants were founded by Syrian and Lebanese families who immigrated to Oklahoma before statehood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gainey|first1=Spencer Livingston|title=BBQ bologna: Oklahoma’s legendary Lebanese steakhouses|url=https://nondoc.com/2015/12/08/lebanese-steakhouses-its-just-different/|accessdate=14 August 2016|work=NON DOC|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, many of these restaurants had live entertainment (including performers like [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and the [[Ink Spots]]) and featured Mediterranean dishes like tabbouleh, rice pilaf and hummus alongside local favorites like smoked BBQ bologna.

===Chili and Coney Island Hot Dogs===

Oklahomans have been consuming chili since well before statehood, owing to the influence of [[Mexican-American]] culture on the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Dianna |title=Chili|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=CHILI|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, iconic Tulsa restaurant Ike's Chili Parlor opened and Ivan &quot;Ike&quot; Johnson is purported to have acquired his recipe from a Hispanic-Texan named Alex Garcia.

Greek immigrants to Tulsa who came by way of [[Brooklyn]], Pennsylvania and [[Michigan]] brought with them the tradition of [[Coney Island hot dog|Coney Island-style hot dogs]] with chili on a bun.&lt;ref name=&quot;cauthron&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P2-2179765/one-hot-dog-how-tulsa-became-a-coney-town | title=One Hot Dog: How Tulsa Became a Coney Town | accessdate=July 26, 2015 | author=Cauthron, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, a related group of [[Greek-American]] families operate Coney restaurants around the city, including [[Coney I-Lander]] which opened in 1926 and was described by food writers [[Jane and Michael Stern]] as perfectly delivering &quot;the cheap-eats ecstasy that is the Coney's soul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=Jane|last2=Stern|first2=Michael|title=500 Things to Eat Before it's Too Late:and the Very Best Places to Eat Them|date=2009|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-05907-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these restaurants sell Greek food, either year round or  at Tulsa's annual Greek Holiday, sponsored by Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church (which dates to 1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Dianna |title=HOLY TRINITY GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH (Tulsa).|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=HO019|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern &quot;Homestyle&quot; Food===
By and large, Tulsa's traditional cuisine reflects the influence of Southern foodways, particularly &quot;upland South and... Texas where many of Oklahoma's nineteenth-century population originated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Dianna|title=State Meal|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=ST023|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prominence of certain foods reflects the agricultural heritage of the surrounding regions. For instance, at the suggestion of experts at what is now [[Oklahoma State University]], peanuts became a major crop in now eastern Oklahoma as a means for lessening the reliance on cotton cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Dianna|title=Peanuts|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=PE002|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicken-fried steak is part of the state meal of Oklahoma and is the signature dish at a number of Tulsa restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cherry|first1=Scott|last2=Watts|first2=James|title=Where, why and how: 5 great chicken-fried steaks at area eateries|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/food/where-why-and-how-great-chicken-fried-steaks-at-area/article_20e8bb1b-5e10-571d-b64a-cd98aa2561ca.html|accessdate=14 August 2016|work=Tulsa World|date=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weaver|first1=Bobby|title=Chicken-Fried Steak|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=CHICKEN-FRIED%20STEAK|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===K–12 education===
The [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church (PCUSA)]] established the Presbyterian Mission Day School, a one-story building  at what would become 4th Street and Boston Avenue in 1884. A second story was soon added to accommodate the number of children who were to attend. This school operated until 1889.&lt;ref name=&quot;TPC-Education&quot;&gt;Tulsa Preservation Commission Website. &quot;Tulsa History – Education.(1880–1941)&quot;. Retrieved December 28, 2010. [http://www.tulsapreservationcommission.org/history/education/]&lt;/ref&gt; When Tulsa incorporated in 1899, it took over the school and became the first public school. James M. Hall and three other men bought the property with their own funds and held the title until the city could reimburse them.&lt;ref name=&quot;TPC-Education&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hallobit&quot;&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/oh2/fountainofyouth/hall.html &quot;Obituary:James M. Hall,&quot; ''Tulsa World'', May 27, 1935]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tulsa built its first two public schools in 1905. Construction of more schools began accelerating in 1906. In December 1907, control of the public schools passed from the city government to the Tulsa Board of Education.&lt;ref name=&quot;TPC-Education&quot; /&gt;

'''Tulsa High School''' opened in 1906 on the same block formerly occupied by the Presbyterian mission school, which had been razed. The new school was a three-story cream colored brick building with a dome. The school was accredited by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges in 1913. It proved too small by 1916, when Tulsa voters approved a bond issue to construct a new high school at Sixth Street and Cincinnati Avenue, which was renamed [[Central High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Central High School]]. The north half of this facility opened in 1917, while the south half opened in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsacentralalumni.org/central.htm|title=Tulsa Central History|work=tulsacentralalumni.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building remained in this service until 1976, when it was replaced by a new building on West Edison Street.

Tulsa Transit  has two stations: one in Midtown Tulsa, and another across from the BOK Center in Downtown.  Most routes go through one or both of these stations, facilitating the commute to work and events in downtown or midtown. Buses stop at specific stops such as TCC, OSU-Tulsa, Cityplex Tower, Cox Communications, Hillcrest Medical Center, and many shopping destinations, hotels, and schools. The bus schedules are periodically changed; votes are taken by [[Tulsa Transit]] to help decide what are the best specifics for certain routes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tulsatransit.org/2013/06/route-117-and-118-proposed-changes/ Route 117 and 118 Proposed Changes].
