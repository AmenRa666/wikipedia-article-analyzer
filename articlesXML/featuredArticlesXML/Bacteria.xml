'''Bacteria''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-bacteria.ogg|b|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪər|i|ə}}; common noun '''bacteria''', singular '''bacterium''') constitute a large [[domain (biology)|domain]] of [[prokaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s.

Once regarded as [[plant]]s constituting the class ''Schizomycetes'', bacteria are now classified as [[prokaryotes]]. Unlike cells of animals and other [[eukaryote]]s, bacterial cells do not contain a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and rarely harbour [[cell membrane|membrane-bound]] [[organelle]]s. Although the term ''bacteria'' traditionally included all prokaryotes, the [[scientific classification]] changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that [[evolution|evolved]] from an ancient common ancestor. These [[domain (biology)|evolutionary domains]] are called ''Bacteria'' and ''[[Archaea]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woese&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese CR, Kandler O, Wheelis ML | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | pmc = 54159 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | bibcode = 1990PNAS...87.4576W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Life timeline}}
The word ''bacteria'' is the plural of the [[New Latin]] ''{{lang|la|bacterium}}'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|βακτήριον}} (''bakterion''),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|bakth/rion|βακτήριον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the diminutive of [[wikt:βακτηρία|βακτηρία]] (''bakteria''), meaning &quot;staff, cane&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|bakthri/a|βακτηρία|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; because the first ones to be discovered were rod-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0055310#dws-m_en_gb-m-en_gb-msdict-00002%E2%80%93034344 bacterium], on ''Oxford Dictionaries''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and early evolution==
{{further|Timeline of evolution|Evolutionary history of life}}
The ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the [[Abiogenesis|first forms of life]] to appear on Earth, about 4 billion years ago. For about 3 billion years, most organisms were microscopic, and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schopf JW | title = Disparate rates, differing fates: tempo and mode of evolution changed from the Precambrian to the Phanerozoic | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 15 | pages = 6735–42 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8041691 | pmc = 44277 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6735 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.6735S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeLong EF, Pace NR | title = Environmental diversity of bacteria and archaea | journal = Syst Biol | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 470–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = 12116647 | doi = 10.1080/106351501750435040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, fossils of macroorganisms were discovered and named as the [[Francevillian biota]]. Although bacterial [[fossil]]s exist, such as [[stromatolite]]s, their lack of distinctive [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution, or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species. However, gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown JR, Doolittle WF | title = Archaea and the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 456–502 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9409149 | pmc = 232621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The [[most recent common ancestor]] of bacteria and archaea was probably a [[thermophile|hyperthermophile]] that lived about 2.5 billion–3.2 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Di Giulio M |title=The universal ancestor and the ancestor of bacteria were hyperthermophiles |journal=J Mol Evol |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=721–30 |year=2003 |pmid=14745541 |doi=10.1007/s00239-003-2522-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Battistuzzi FU, Feijao A, Hedges SB |title=A genomic timescale of prokaryote evolution: insights into the origin of methanogenesis, phototrophy, and the colonization of land |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=4 |pages=44 |year=2004 |pmid=15535883 |pmc=533871 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-44}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
Bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence, that of the archaea and eukaryotes. Here, eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells, which were themselves possibly related to the [[Archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poole AM, Penny D | title = Evaluating hypotheses for the origin of eukaryotes | journal = BioEssays | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 74–84 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17187354 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dyall&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dyall SD, Brown MT, Johnson PJ | title = Ancient invasions: from endosymbionts to organelles | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5668 | pages = 253–7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15073369 | doi = 10.1126/science.1094884 | bibcode = 2004Sci...304..253D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of [[alphaproteobacteria]]l symbionts to form either [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] or [[hydrogenosome]]s, which are still found in all known Eukarya (sometimes in highly [[reduced form]], e.g. in ancient &quot;amitochondrial&quot; protozoa). Later on, some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacterial-like organisms. This led to the formation of [[chloroplast]]s in algae and plants. There are also some algae that originated from even later endosymbiotic events. Here, eukaryotes engulfed a eukaryotic algae that developed into a &quot;second-generation&quot; plastid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lang BF, Gray MW, Burger G | title = Mitochondrial genome evolution and the origin of eukaryotes | journal = Annu Rev Genet | volume = 33 | pages = 351–97 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10690412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.33.1.351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McFadden GI | title = Endosymbiosis and evolution of the plant cell | journal = Current Opinion in Plant Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 513–9 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10607659 | doi = 10.1016/S1369-5266(99)00025-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as [[secondary endosymbiosis]].

Many bacterial species exist simply as single cells, others associate in characteristic patterns: ''[[Neisseria]]'' form diploids (pairs), ''[[Streptococcus]]'' form chains, and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' group together in &quot;bunch of grapes&quot; clusters. Bacteria can also be elongated to form filaments, for example the [[Actinobacteria]]. [[Filamentous bacteria]] are often surrounded by a sheath that contains many individual cells. Certain types, such as species of the genus ''[[Nocardia]]'', even form complex, branched filaments, similar in appearance to fungal [[Mycelium|mycelia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Douwes KE, Schmalzbauer E, Linde HJ, Reisberger EM, Fleischer K, Lehn N, Landthaler M, Vogt T | title = Branched filaments no fungus, ovoid bodies no bacteria: Two unusual cases of mycetoma | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 49 | issue = 2 Suppl Case Reports | pages = S170–3 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12894113 | doi = 10.1067/mjd.2003.302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteria often attach to surfaces and form dense aggregations called ''[[biofilm]]s'' or [[bacterial mat]]s. These films can range from a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, [[protist]]s and [[archaea]]. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donlan RM | title = Biofilms: microbial life on surfaces | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 881–90 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12194761 | pmc = 2732559 | doi = 10.3201/eid0809.020063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Branda SS, Vik S, Friedman L, Kolter R | title = Biofilms: the matrix revisited | journal = Trends Microbiol | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15639628 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2004.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms.&lt;ref name=Davey&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davey ME, O'toole GA | title = Microbial biofilms: from ecology to molecular genetics | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 847–67 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11104821 | pmc = 99016 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.64.4.847-867.2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of [[implant (medicine)|implanted]] [[medical device]]s, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Donlan RM, Costerton JW | title = Biofilms: survival mechanisms of clinically relevant microorganisms | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–93 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11932229 | pmc = 118068 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.15.2.167-193.2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more complex morphological changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, [[Myxobacteria]] detect surrounding cells in a process known as [[quorum sensing]], migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500&amp;nbsp;micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shimkets LJ | title = Intercellular signaling during fruiting-body development of Myxococcus xanthus | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 53 | pages = 525–49 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10547700 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.53.1.525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisation. For example, about one in 10 cells migrate to the top of these fruiting bodies and [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into a specialised dormant state called myxospores, which are more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions than are ordinary cells.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaiser D | title = Signaling in myxobacteria | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 58 | pages = 75–98 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15487930 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intracellular structures===
The bacterial cell is surrounded by a [[cell membrane]] (also known as a [[lipid]], [[cytoplasm]]ic or plasma membrane). This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, [[protein]]s and other essential components of the ''[[cytoplasm]]'' within the cell. As they are [[prokaryote]]s, bacteria do not usually have membrane-bound [[organelle]]s in their cytoplasm, and thus contain few large intracellular structures.

===Extracellular structures===
{{further|Cell envelope}}
In most bacteria, a ''[[cell wall#Bacterial cell walls|cell wall]]'' is present on the outside of the [[cell membrane]]. The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the ''[[cell envelope]]''. A common bacterial cell wall material is ''[[peptidoglycan]]'' (called &quot;murein&quot; in older sources), which is made from [[polysaccharide]] chains cross-linked by [[peptide]]s containing D-[[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Heijenoort J | title = Formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan | journal = Glycobiology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 25R–36R | year = 2001 | pmid = 11320055 | doi = 10.1093/glycob/11.3.25R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]], which are made of [[cellulose]] and [[chitin]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koch AL | title = Bacterial wall as target for attack: past, present, and future research | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 673–87 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14557293 | pmc = 207114 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.16.4.673-687.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, and the antibiotic [[penicillin]] is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt;

There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria, a thick one in the [[gram-positive]]s and a thinner one in the [[gram-negative]]s. The names originate from the reaction of cells to the [[Gram stain]], a long-standing test for the classification of bacterial species.&lt;ref name=Gram&gt;{{cite journal|last = Gram|first = HC|authorlink = Hans Christian Gram |year=1884 |title=Über die isolierte Färbung der Schizomyceten in Schnitt- und Trockenpräparaten |journal=Fortschr. Med. |volume=2 |pages=185–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gram-positive bacteria]]'' possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and ''[[teichoic acid]]s''. In contrast, ''[[gram-negative bacteria]]'' have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second [[Lipid bilayer|lipid membrane]] containing ''[[lipopolysaccharide]]s'' and [[lipoprotein]]s. Lipopolysaccharides, also called ''[[endotoxin]]s'', are composed of polysaccharides and ''[[lipopolysaccharide#Composition|lipid A]]'' that is responsible for much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the [[Firmicutes]] and [[Actinobacteria]] have the alternative gram-positive arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hugenholtz P | title = Exploring prokaryotic diversity in the genomic era | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = reviews0003.1–reviews0003.8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11864374 | pmc = 139013 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2002-3-2-reviews0003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, [[vancomycin]] can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative [[pathogen]]s, such as ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walsh FM, Amyes SG | title = Microbiology and drug resistance mechanisms of fully resistant pathogens | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 439–44 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15451497 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2004.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a ''[[protoplast]]'', whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a ''[[spheroplast]]''. [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|''β''-Lactam antibiotics]], such as [[penicillin]], inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme [[lysozyme]], found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.

''[[Acid-fast|Acid-fast bacteria]]'', such as ''Mycobacteria'', are resistant to decolorisation by acids during [[staining]] procedures. The high [[mycolic acid]] content of ''[[Mycobacteria]]'', is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]] or acid-fast stain, in which the acid-fast bacilli are stained bright-red and stand out clearly against a blue background. ''[[L-form bacteria]]'' are strains of bacteria that lack cell walls. The main [[pathogenic bacteria]] in this class is ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' (not to be confused with ''Mycobacteria'').

In many bacteria, an ''[[S-layer]]'' of rigidly arrayed protein molecules covers the outside of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engelhardt H, Peters J | title = Structural research on surface layers: a focus on stability, surface layer homology domains, and surface layer-cell wall interactions | journal = J Struct Biol | volume = 124 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 276–302 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10049812 | doi = 10.1006/jsbi.1998.4070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] [[diffusion barrier]].

''[[Flagellum|Flagella]]'' are rigid protein structures, about 20&amp;nbsp;nanometres in diameter and up to 20&amp;nbsp;micrometres in length, that are used for [[motility]]. Flagella are driven by the energy released by the transfer of [[ion]]s down an [[electrochemical gradient]] across the cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kojima S, Blair DF | title = The bacterial flagellar motor: structure and function of a complex molecular machine | journal = Int Rev Cytol | volume = 233 | pages = 93–134 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15037363 | doi = 10.1016/S0074-7696(04)33003-2 | isbn = 978-0-12-364637-8 | series = International Review of Cytology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fimbria (bacteriology)|Fimbriae]]'' (sometimes called &quot;[[pilus#Fimbriae|attachment pili]]&quot;) are fine filaments of protein, usually 2–10&amp;nbsp;nanometres in diameter and up to several micrometres in length.

''[[Glycocalyx#Glycocalyx in Bacteria and Nature|Glycocalyx]]'' are produced by many bacteria to surround their cells, and vary in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised ''[[slime layer]]'' of extra-cellular [[polymer]] to a highly structured ''[[bacterial capsule|capsule]]''.

The assembly of these extracellular structures is dependent on bacterial [[secretion|secretion systems]].

Certain [[Genus|genera]] of gram-positive bacteria, such as ''[[Bacillus]]'', ''[[Clostridium]]'', ''[[Sporohalobacter]]'', ''[[Anaerobacter]]'', and ''[[Heliobacteria|Heliobacterium]]'', can form highly resistant, dormant structures called ''[[endospore]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicholson WL, Munakata N, Horneck G, Melosh HJ, Setlow P | title = Resistance of Bacillus endospores to extreme terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 548–72 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10974126 | pmc = 99004 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.64.3.548-572.2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all cases, one endospore is formed and this is not a reproductive process, although ''[[Anaerobacter]]'' can make up to seven endospores in a single cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siunov AV, Nikitin DV, Suzina NE, Dmitriev VV, Kuzmin NP, Duda VI | title = Phylogenetic status of Anaerobacter polyendosporus, an anaerobic, polysporogenic bacterium | journal = Int J Syst Bacteriol | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 1119–24 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10425769 | doi = 10.1099/00207713-49-3-1119 | url = http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/49/3/1119.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endospores have a central core of [[cytoplasm]] containing [[DNA]] and [[ribosome]]s surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat.

Carbon metabolism in bacteria is either ''[[heterotroph]]ic'', where [[organic compound|organic carbon]] compounds are used as carbon sources, or ''[[autotroph]]ic'', meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by [[Carbon fixation|fixing]] [[carbon dioxide]]. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic [[cyanobacteria]], green sulfur-bacteria and some [[purple bacteria]], but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hellingwerf KJ, Crielaard W, Hoff WD, Matthijs HC, Mur LR, van Rotterdam BJ | title = Photobiology of bacteria | journal = Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 331–47 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7832590 | doi = 10.1007/BF00872217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on ''[[phototroph]]y'', the use of light through [[photosynthesis]], or based on ''[[chemotroph]]y'', the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised at the expense of oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).
[[File:Bluegreen algae.jpg|thumb|right|alt=blue green algae filaments|Filaments of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[cyanobacteria]]]]

Bacteria are further divided into ''[[lithotroph]]s'' that use inorganic electron donors and ''[[organotroph]]s'' that use organic compounds as electron donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use [[chemical compound]]s as a source of energy by taking electrons from the [[redox|reduced]] substrate and transferring them to a [[terminal electron acceptor]] in a [[redox|redox reaction]]. This reaction releases energy that can be used to synthesise [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and drive metabolism. In ''[[aerobic organism]]s'', [[oxygen]] is used as the electron acceptor. In ''[[anaerobic organism]]s'' other [[inorganic compound]]s, such as [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]] or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of [[denitrification]], sulfate reduction, and [[acetogenesis]], respectively.

Another way of life of chemotrophs in the absence of possible electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., [[lactic acid|lactate]], [[ethanol]], [[hydrogen]], [[butyric acid]]). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zumft WG | title = Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 533–616 | date = 1 December 1997 | pmid = 9409151 | pmc = 232623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Drake HL, Daniel SL, Küsel K, Matthies C, Kuhner C, Braus-Stromeyer S | title = Acetogenic bacteria: what are the in situ consequences of their diverse metabolic versatilities? | journal = BioFactors | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–24 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9233536 | doi = 10.1002/biof.5520060103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These processes are also important in biological responses to [[pollution]]; for example, [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] ([[methylmercury|methyl-]] and [[dimethylmercury]]) in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morel FM, Kraepiel AM, Amyot M |year=1998 |title=The chemical cycle and bioaccumulation of mercury |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=29|pages = 543–566 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.29.1.543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-respiratory anaerobes use [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as [[ethanol]] in brewing) as waste. [[Facultative anaerobe]]s can switch between fermentation and different [[terminal electron acceptor]]s depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

Lithotrophic bacteria can use inorganic compounds as a source of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, [[carbon monoxide]], [[ammonia]] (leading to [[nitrification]]), [[ferrous iron]] and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced [[sulfur]] compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas [[methane]] can be used by [[methanotroph]]ic bacteria as both a source of [[electron]]s and a substrate for carbon [[anabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalton H | title = The Leeuwenhoek Lecture 2000 the natural and unnatural history of methane-oxidizing bacteria | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | volume = 360 | issue = 1458 | pages = 1207–22 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16147517 | pmc = 1569495 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2005.1657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both aerobic phototrophy and [[chemolithotroph]]y, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.

In addition to fixing carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, some bacteria also fix [[nitrogen]] gas ([[nitrogen fixation]]) using the enzyme [[nitrogenase]]. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of nearly all the metabolic types listed above, but is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zehr JP, Jenkins BD, Short SM, Steward GF | title = Nitrogenase gene diversity and microbial community structure: a cross-system comparison | journal = Environ Microbiol | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 539–54 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12823187 | doi = 10.1046/j.1462-2920.2003.00451.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the type of metabolic process they employ, the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules, which enter the cell by diffusion or through molecular channels in cell membranes. The Planctomycetes are the exception (as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material). It has recently been shown that ''[[Gemmata obscuriglobus]]'' is able to take in large molecules via a process that in some ways resembles [[endocytosis]], the process used by eukaryotic cells to engulf external items.&lt;ref name=Williams2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lonhienne2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lonhienne TG, Sagulenko E, Webb RI, Lee KC, Franke J, Devos DP, Nouwens A, Carroll BJ, Fuerst JA | title = Endocytosis-like protein uptake in the bacterium ''Gemmata obscuriglobus'' | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 29 | pages = 12883–12888 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20566852 | pmc = 2919973 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1001085107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712883L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and reproduction==

{{further|Bacterial growth}}
Unlike in multicellular organisms, increases in cell size ([[cell growth]]) and reproduction by [[cell division]] are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through ''[[binary fission]]'', a form of [[asexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koch AL | title = Control of the bacterial cell cycle by cytoplasmic growth | journal = Crit Rev Microbiol | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–77 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12003041 | doi = 10.1080/1040-840291046696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eagon RG | title = Pseudomonas natriegens, a marine bacterium with a generation time of less than 10 minutes | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 736–7 | year = 1962 | pmid = 13888946 | pmc = 279347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cell division, two identical [[clone (genetics)|clone]] daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by ''[[Myxobacteria]]'' and aerial [[hypha]]e formation by ''[[Streptomyces]]'', or budding. Budding involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.

In the laboratory, bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid ''[[Growth medium|growth media]]'', such as [[agar plate]]s, are used to [[Isolation (microbiology)|isolate]] pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomson RB, Bertram H | title = Laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system infections | journal = Infectious Disease Clinics of North America | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 1047–71 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11780267 | doi = 10.1016/S0891-5520(05)70186-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies (see [[r/K selection theory]]). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of [[algal bloom|algal]] (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paerl HW, Fulton RS, Moisander PH, Dyble J | title = Harmful freshwater algal blooms, with an emphasis on cyanobacteria | journal = ScientificWorldJournal | volume = 1 | pages = 76–113 | year = 2001 | pmid = 12805693 | doi = 10.1100/tsw.2001.16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple [[antibiotic]]s by ''[[Streptomyces]]'' that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Challis GL, Hopwood DA | title = Synergy and contingency as driving forces for the evolution of multiple secondary metabolite production by Streptomyces species | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 Suppl 2 | issue = 90002 | pages = 14555–61 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12970466 | pmc = 304118 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1934677100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..10014555C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., [[biofilm]]s) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses.&lt;ref name=Davey/&gt; These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms ([[syntrophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kooijman SA, Auger P, Poggiale JC, Kooi BW | title = Quantitative steps in symbiogenesis and the evolution of homeostasis | journal = Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 435–63 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14558592 | doi = 10.1017/S1464793102006127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bacterial growth]]'' follows four phases. When a population of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the ''[[Stationary phase (biology)|lag phase]]'', a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prats C, López D, Giró A, Ferrer J, Valls J | title = Individual-based modelling of bacterial cultures to study the microscopic causes of the lag phase | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 241 | issue = 4 | pages = 939–53 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16524598 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.01.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase of growth is the ''[[Stationary phase (biology)|log phase]]'', also known as the ''logarithmic or exponential phase''. The log phase is marked by rapid [[exponential growth]]. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the ''growth rate'' (''k''), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the ''generation time'' (''g''). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the ''[[Stationary phase (biology)|stationary phase]]'' and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in [[DNA repair]], [[antioxidant|antioxidant metabolism]] and [[active transport|nutrient transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hecker M, Völker U | title = General stress response of Bacillus subtilis and other bacteria | journal = Adv Microb Physiol | volume = 44 | pages = 35–91 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11407115 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2911(01)44011-2 | isbn = 978-0-12-027744-5 | series = Advances in Microbial Physiology }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final phase is the ''[[Stationary phase (biology)|death phase]]'' where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.

==Genomes==

The genomes of thousands of bacterial species have been sequenced, with at least 9,000 sequences completed and more than 42,000 left as &quot;permanent&quot; drafts (as of Sep 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/index|title=Genomes Online Database|last=|first=|date=|website=Genomes Online Database|publisher=Joint Genome Institute|access-date=14 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Plasmid]]s'' are small extra-chromosomal DNAs that may contain genes for [[antibiotic resistance]] or [[virulence|virulence factors]]. Plasmids replicate independently of chromosomes, so it is possible that plasmids could be lost in bacterial cell division. Against this possibility is the fact that a single bacterium can contain hundreds of copies of a single plasmid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = The University of Waikato | title = Bacterial DNA – the role of plasmids | work = Themes &amp;mdash; Bacteria in biotech | publisher = Biotechnology Learning Hub | date = March 25, 2014 | url = http://www.biotechlearn.org.nz/themes/bacteria_in_biotech/bacterial_dna_the_role_of_plasmids | accessdate = 2014-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
Bacteria, as asexual organisms, inherit identical copies of their parent's genes (i.e., they are [[clone (genetics)|clonal]]). However, all bacteria can evolve by selection on changes to their genetic material [[DNA]] caused by [[genetic recombination]] or [[mutation]]s. Mutations come from errors made during the replication of DNA or from exposure to [[mutagen]]s. Mutation rates vary widely among different species of bacteria and even among different clones of a single species of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Denamur E, Matic I | title = Evolution of mutation rates in bacteria | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 820–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16677295 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05150.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic changes in bacterial genomes come from either random mutation during replication or &quot;stress-directed mutation&quot;, where genes involved in a particular growth-limiting process have an increased mutation rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright BE | title = Stress-directed adaptive mutations and evolution | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 643–50 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15101972 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04012.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA transfer===
Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells. This can occur in three main ways. First, bacteria can take up exogenous DNA from their environment, in a process called ''[[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]''.  Genes can also be transferred by the process of ''[[transduction (genetics)|transduction]]'', when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome.  The third method of gene transfer is ''[[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]]'', whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact.

Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to be a consequence of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles, rather than a bacterial adaptation. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium. Plasmid-mediated transfer of host bacterial DNA also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation.

Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen I, Dubnau D | title = DNA uptake during bacterial transformation | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15083159 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro844 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer. In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see [[Natural competence]]). In ''Bacillus subtilis'', about 40 genes are required for the development of competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Solomon JM, Grossman AD | title = Who's competent and when: regulation of natural genetic competence in bacteria | journal = Trends Genet. | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 150–5 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8901420 | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(96)10014-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of DNA transferred during ''B. subtilis'' transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Akamatsu T, Taguchi H | title = Incorporation of the whole chromosomal DNA in protoplast lysates into competent cells of Bacillus subtilis | journal = Biosci.

Microbiol. | volume = 158 | issue = 10 | pages = 767–78 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17997281 | doi = 10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2012). &quot;DNA repair as the primary adaptive function of sex in bacteria and eukaryotes&quot;.

In ordinary circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | journal = Infect.

===Bacteriophages===
{{Main|Bacteriophage}}
[[Bacteriophage]]s are viruses that infect bacteria. Many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply infect and [[lytic cycle|lyse]] their [[host (biology)|host]] bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome. A bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute to its host's [[phenotype]]: for example, in the evolution of [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] and ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', the [[toxin]] genes in an integrated phage converted a harmless ancestral bacterium into a lethal pathogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brüssow H, Canchaya C, Hardt WD | title = Phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 560–602 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15353570 | pmc = 515249 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.68.3.560-602.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria resist phage infection through [[restriction modification system]]s that degrade foreign DNA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bickle TA, Krüger DH | title = Biology of DNA restriction | journal = Microbiol. Rev. | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434–50 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8336674 | pmc = 372918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a system that uses [[CRISPR]] sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of [[RNA interference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barrangou R, Fremaux C, Deveau H, Richards M, Boyaval P, Moineau S, Romero DA, Horvath P | title = CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5819 | pages = 1709–12 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17379808 | doi = 10.1126/science.1138140 | bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1709B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brouns SJ, Jore MM, Lundgren M, Westra ER, Slijkhuis RJ, Snijders AP, Dickman MJ, Makarova KS, Koonin EV, van der Oost J | title = Small CRISPR RNAs guide antiviral defense in prokaryotes | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = 5891 | pages = 960–4 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18703739 | doi = 10.1126/science.1159689| bibcode = 2008Sci...321..960B }}&lt;/ref&gt; This CRISPR system provides bacteria with [[immunity (medical)|acquired immunity]] to infection.

==Behaviour==

===Secretion===
Bacteria frequently secrete chemicals into their environment in order to modify it favourably. The [[secretion]]s are often proteins and may act as enzymes that digest some form of food in the environment.

===Bioluminescence===
{{Further|Milky seas effect}}
A few bacteria have chemical systems that generate light. This [[bioluminescence]] often occurs in bacteria that live in association with fish, and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals.&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (1996). ''Life at Small Scale''. Scientific American Library. ISBN 0-7167-5060-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multicellularity===
{{See also|Prokaryote#Sociality}}
Bacteria often function as multicellular aggregates known as [[biofilms]], exchanging a variety of molecular signals for [[Cell signaling|inter-cell communication]], and engaging in coordinated multicellular behaviour.&lt;ref name=shapiro1&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shapiro JA |title=Thinking about bacterial populations as multicellular organisms |journal=Annu. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=52 |pages=81–104 |year=1998 |pmid=9891794 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.52.1.81 |url=http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/newton/math501/Sp05/Shapiro.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717183759/http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/newton/math501/Sp05/Shapiro.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=costerton1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Costerton JW, Lewandowski Z, Caldwell DE, Korber DR, Lappin-Scott HM |title=Microbial biofilms |journal=Annu. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=49 |pages=711–45 |year=1995 |doi=10.1146/annurev.mi.49.100195.003431 |pmid=8561477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communal benefits of multicellular cooperation include a cellular division of labour, accessing resources that cannot effectively be used by single cells, collectively defending against antagonists, and optimising population survival by differentiating into distinct cell types.&lt;ref name=shapiro1/&gt; For example, bacteria in biofilms can have more than 500 times increased resistance to [[Bactericide|antibacterial]] agents than individual &quot;planktonic&quot; bacteria of the same species.&lt;ref name=costerton1/&gt;

One type of inter-cellular communication by a molecular signal is called [[quorum sensing]], which serves the purpose of determining whether there is a local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.

Quorum sensing allows bacteria to coordinate gene expression, and enables them to produce, release and detect [[autoinducer]]s or [[pheromones]] which accumulate with the growth in cell population.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11544353&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller MB, Bassler BL | title = Quorum sensing in bacteria | journal = Annu. Rev. Microbiol. | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 165–99 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11544353 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement===
{{further|Chemotaxis|Flagellum|Pilus}}
Many bacteria can move using a variety of mechanisms: [[Flagellum|flagella]] are used for swimming through fluids; [[bacterial gliding]] and [[pilus#type iv pili|twitching motility]] move bacteria across surfaces; and changes of buoyancy allow vertical motion.&lt;ref name=Bardy&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bardy S, Ng S, Jarrell K |title=Prokaryotic motility structures|journal=Microbiology |volume=149 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=295–304 |year=2003|pmid = 12624192 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.25948-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flagellum base diagram en.svg|thumb|350px|alt=diagram of Flagellum bacteria|Flagellum of gram-negative bacteria. The base drives the rotation of the hook and filament.]]

Swimming bacteria frequently move near 10 body lengths per second and a few as fast as 100. This makes them at least as fast as fish, on a relative scale.&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', p. 136. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. ISBN 978-0-674-03116-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In bacterial gliding and twitching motility, bacteria use their ''[[pilus#type iv pili|type IV pili]]'' as a grappling hook, repeatedly extending it, anchoring it and then retracting it with remarkable force (&gt;80 [[Newton (unit)|pN]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Merz A, So M, Sheetz M |title=Pilus retraction powers bacterial twitching motility |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6800 |pages=98–102 |year=2000 |pmid=10993081 |doi=10.1038/35024105|bibcode=2000Natur.407...98M }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|''&quot;Our observations redefine twitching motility as a rapid, highly organized mechanism of bacterial translocation by which [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] can disperse itself over large areas to colonize new territories. It is also now clear, both morphologically and genetically, that twitching motility and social gliding motility, such as occurs in [[Myxococcus xanthus]], are essentially the same process.&quot;''|[http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/145/10/2863.full &quot;A re-examination of twitching motility in ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''&quot; – Semmler, Whitchurch &amp; Mattick (1999)]}}

''[[Flagellum|Flagella]]'' are semi-rigid cylindrical structures that are rotated and function much like the propeller on a ship. Objects as small as bacteria operate a low [[Reynolds number]] and cylindrical forms are more efficient than the flat, paddle-like, forms appropriate at human-size scale.&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', Chapter 13. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. ISBN 978-0-674-03116-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacterial species differ in the number and arrangement of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (''[[Flagellum#Flagellar arrangement schemes|monotrichous]]''), a flagellum at each end (''[[Flagellum#Flagellar arrangement schemes|amphitrichous]]''), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (''[[Flagellum#Flagellar arrangement schemes|lophotrichous]]''), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (''[[Flagellum#Flagellar arrangement schemes|peritrichous]]''). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly.&lt;ref name=Bardy/&gt; The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the [[electrochemical gradient]] across the membrane for power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Macnab RM |title=The bacterial flagellum: reversible rotary propellor and type III export apparatus |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=181 |issue=23 |pages=7149–53 |date=1 December 1999|pmid=10572114 |pmc=103673}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motor drives the motion of the filament, which acts as a propeller.

Many bacteria (such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'') have two distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling allows them to reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional [[random walk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu M, Roberts J, Kim S, Koch D, DeLisa M |title=Collective bacterial dynamics revealed using a three-dimensional population-scale defocused particle tracking technique |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=72 |issue=7 |pages=4987–94 |year=2006 |pmid=16820497 |doi=10.1128/AEM.00158-06 |pmc=1489374}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See external links below for link to videos.) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the [[spirochaete]]s, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive [[helix|helical]] body that twists about as it moves.&lt;ref name=Bardy/&gt;

Motile bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] in behaviours called '''[[taxis|taxes]]''': these include [[chemotaxis]], [[phototaxis]], [[taxis|energy taxis]], and [[magnetotaxis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lux R, Shi W |title=Chemotaxis-guided movements in bacteria |journal=Crit Rev Oral Biol Med |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=207–20 |year=2004 |pmid=15284186 |doi=10.1177/154411130401500404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schweinitzer T, Josenhans C |title= Bacterial energy taxis: a global strategy?|journal= Arch Microbiol|year= 2010 |volume=192|pages=507–20|doi=10.1007/s00203-010-0575-7|issue=7|pmid=20411245|pmc=2886117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frankel R, Bazylinski D, Johnson M, Taylor B |title=Magneto-aerotaxis in marine coccoid bacteria |journal=Biophys J |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=994–1000 |year=1997 |pmid=9251816 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78132-3 |pmc=1180996 |bibcode=1997BpJ....73..994F}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one peculiar group, the [[myxobacteria]], individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The [[myxobacteria]] move only when on solid surfaces, unlike ''E. coli'', which is [[Motility|motile]] in liquid or solid media.

Several ''[[Listeria]]'' and ''[[Shigella]]'' species move inside host cells by usurping the [[cytoskeleton]], which is normally used to move [[organelle]]s inside the cell. By promoting [[actin]] [[biopolymer|polymerisation]] at one pole of their cells, they can form a kind of tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldberg MB |title=Actin-based motility of intracellular microbial pathogens |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=595–626, table of contents |year=2001 |pmid=11729265 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.65.4.595-626.2001 |pmc=99042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Bacterial taxonomy}}
{{further|Scientific classification|Systematics|Bacterial phyla|Clinical pathology}}

[[Scientific classification|Classification]] seeks to describe the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified on the basis of cell structure, [[Cell metabolism|cellular metabolism]] or on differences in cell components, such as [[DNA]], [[fatty acid]]s, pigments, [[antigen]]s and [[quinone]]s.&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was due to the lack of distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as [[lateral gene transfer]] between unrelated species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boucher Y, Douady CJ, Papke RT, Walsh DA, Boudreau ME, Nesbo CL, Case RJ, Doolittle WF |title=Lateral gene transfer and the origins of prokaryotic groups |journal=Annu Rev Genet |volume=37 |pages=283–328|year = 2003|pmid=14616063 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.37.050503.084247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises [[molecular systematics]], using genetic techniques such as [[guanine]] [[cytosine]] [[GC-content|ratio]] determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the [[ribosomal DNA|rRNA gene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsen GJ, Woese CR, Overbeek R |title=The winds of (evolutionary) change: breathing new life into microbiology |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=1994 |pmid=8282683 |pmc=205007 |doi=10.2172/205047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/ |title=IJSEM Home |publisher=Ijs.sgmjournals.org |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bergeys.org/ |title=Bergey's Manual Trust |publisher=Bergeys.org |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology]] (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]].

The term &quot;bacteria&quot; was traditionally applied to all microscopic, single-cell prokaryotes. However, molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate [[domain (biology)|domain]]s, originally called ''Eubacteria'' and ''Archaebacteria'', but now called ''Bacteria'' and ''[[Archaea]]'' that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woese&quot;/&gt; The archaea and eukaryotes are more closely related to each other than either is to the bacteria. These two domains, along with Eukarya, are the basis of the [[three-domain system]], which is currently the most widely used classification system in microbiolology.&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gupta R |title=The natural evolutionary relationships among prokaryotes |journal=Crit Rev Microbiol |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=111–31 |year=2000 |pmid=10890353 |doi=10.1080/10408410091154219}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the relatively recent introduction of molecular systematics and a rapid increase in the number of genome sequences that are available, bacterial classification remains a changing and expanding field.&lt;ref name=Rappe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doolittle RF |title=Evolutionary aspects of whole-genome biology |journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=248–53 |year=2005 |pmid=15963888 |doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2005.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a few biologists argue that the Archaea and Eukaryotes evolved from gram-positive bacteria.&lt;ref name=Cavalier-Smith2002&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cavalier-Smith T |title=The neomuran origin of archaebacteria, the negibacterial root of the universal tree and bacterial megaclassification |journal=Int J Syst Evol Microbiol |volume=52 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=7–76 |year=2002 |pmid=11837318 |doi=10.1099/00207713-52-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identification of bacteria in the laboratory is particularly relevant in [[medicine]], where the correct treatment is determined by the bacterial species causing an infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria.

The ''[[Gram stain]]'', developed in 1884 by [[Hans Christian Gram]], characterises bacteria based on the structural characteristics of their cell walls.&lt;ref name=Gram/&gt; The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the &quot;gram-positive&quot; cell wall stain purple, while the thin &quot;gram-negative&quot; cell wall appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (gram-positive cocci, gram-positive bacilli, gram-negative cocci and gram-negative bacilli). Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain, particularly mycobacteria or ''Nocardia'', which show [[acid-fast]]ness on [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain|Ziehl–Neelsen]] or similar stains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woods GL, Walker DH |title=Detection of infection or infectious agents by use of cytologic and histologic stains |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=382–404 |year=1996 |pmid=8809467 |pmc=172900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms may need to be identified by their growth in special media, or by other techniques, such as [[serology]].

[[Microbiological culture|Culture]] techniques are designed to promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting the growth of the other bacteria in the sample. Often these techniques are designed for specific specimens; for example, a [[sputum]] sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause [[pneumonia]], while [[feces|stool]] specimens are cultured on [[selective media]] to identify organisms that cause [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as [[blood]], [[urine]] or [[cerebrospinal fluid|spinal fluid]], are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms.&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinstein M |title=Clinical importance of blood cultures |journal=Clin Lab Med |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=9–16 |year=1994|pmid = 8181237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] growth), [[hemolysis (microbiology)|patterns of hemolysis]], and staining.

As with bacterial classification, identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods. Diagnostics using DNA-based tools, such as [[polymerase chain reaction]], are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed, compared to culture-based methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Louie M, Louie L, Simor AE |title=The role of DNA amplification technology in the diagnosis of infectious diseases |journal=CMAJ|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/163/3/301 |volume=163 |issue=3 |pages=301–9 |date=8 August 2000|pmid=10951731 |pmc=80298}}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods also allow the detection and identification of &quot;[[viable but nonculturable]]&quot; cells that are metabolically active but non-dividing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Oliver J |title=The viable but nonculturable state in bacteria |url=http://www.msk.or.kr/jsp/view_old_journalD.jsp?paperSeq=2134 |journal=J Microbiol |volume=43 Spec No |pages=93–100 |year=2005 |pmid=15765062 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928032546/http://www.msk.or.kr/jsp/view_old_journalD.jsp?paperSeq=2134 |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even using these improved methods, the total number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with any certainty.

==Interactions with other organisms==
Despite their apparent simplicity, bacteria can form complex associations with other organisms. These [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations can be divided into [[parasitism]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] and [[commensalism]]. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and [[Perspiration|sweat]], and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of [[body odor|body odour]].

===Predators===
Some species of bacteria kill and then consume other microorganisms, these species are called ''predatory bacteria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin MO |title=Predatory prokaryotes: an emerging research opportunity |journal=Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=467–77 |year=2002 |pmid=12432957}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include organisms such as ''[[Myxococcus xanthus]]'', which forms swarms of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velicer GJ, Stredwick KL |title=Experimental social evolution with Myxococcus xanthus |journal=Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek |volume=81 |issue=1–4 |pages=155–64 |year=2002 |pmid=12448714 |doi=10.1023/A:1020546130033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey in order to digest them and absorb nutrients, such as ''[[Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;GromovBV&quot;&gt;Gromov, BV. &quot;Electron Microscope Study of Parasitism by Bdellovibrio Chorellavorus Bacteria on Cells of the Green Alga Chorella Vulgaris.&quot; Tsitologiya 14.2 (1972): 256-60.

===Mutualists===
Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of [[anaerobic bacteria]] that consume [[organic acid]]s, such as [[butyric acid]] or [[propionic acid]], and produce [[hydrogen]], and [[methanogen]]ic Archaea that consume hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stams AJ, de Bok FA, Plugge CM, van Eekert MH, Dolfing J, Schraa G | title = Exocellular electron transfer in anaerobic microbial communities | journal = Environ Microbiol | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–82 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16478444 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.00989.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.

In soil, microorganisms that reside in the [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]] (a zone that includes the [[root]] surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out [[nitrogen fixation]], converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barea JM, Pozo MJ, Azcón R, Azcón-Aguilar C | title = Microbial co-operation in the rhizosphere | journal = J Exp Bot | volume = 56 | issue = 417 | pages = 1761–78 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15911555 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/eri197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as [[symbiont]]s [[Bacteria in the human body|in humans]] and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human [[gut flora]] of the [[intestine]]s can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise [[vitamin]]s, such as [[folic acid]], [[vitamin K]] and [[biotin]], convert [[Milk protein|sugars]] to [[lactic acid]] (see ''[[Lactobacillus]]''), as well as fermenting complex undigestible [[carbohydrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Hara AM, Shanahan F | title = The gut flora as a forgotten organ | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 688–93 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16819463 | pmc = 1500832 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400731 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zoetendal EG, Vaughan EE, de Vos WM | title = A microbial world within us | journal = Mol Microbiol | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 1639–50 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16553872 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05056.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gorbach SL | title = Lactic acid bacteria and human health | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–41 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2109988 | doi = 10.3109/07853899009147239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through [[competitive exclusion]]) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as [[probiotic]] [[dietary supplement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salminen SJ, Gueimonde M, Isolauri E | title = Probiotics that modify disease risk | journal = J Nutr | volume = 135 | issue = 5 | pages = 1294–8 | date = 1 May 2005 | pmid = 15867327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathogens===
{{Main|Pathogenic bacteria}}

If bacteria form a parasitic association with other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria are a major cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as [[tetanus]], [[typhoid fever]], [[diphtheria]], [[syphilis]], [[cholera]], [[foodborne illness]], [[leprosy]] and [[tuberculosis]]. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, as was the case with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' and [[Timeline of peptic ulcer disease and Helicobacter pylori|peptic ulcer disease]]. Bacterial diseases are also important in [[agriculture]], with bacteria causing [[leaf spot]], [[fire blight]] and [[Wilting|wilts]] in plants, as well as [[Johne's disease]], [[mastitis]], [[salmonellosis|salmonella]] and [[anthrax]] in farm animals.

Each species of pathogen has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Some organisms, such as ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' or ''[[Streptococcus]]'', can cause skin infections, [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]] and even overwhelming [[sepsis]], a systemic [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]] producing [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], massive [[vasodilator|vasodilation]] and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fish DN | title = Optimal antimicrobial therapy for sepsis | journal = Am J Health Syst Pharm | volume = 59 Suppl 1 | pages = S13–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11885408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet these organisms are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the [[nose]] without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the [[Rickettsia]], which are [[obligate intracellular parasite]]s able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes [[typhus]], while another causes [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]]. ''[[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]]'', another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or [[urinary tract infection]] and may be involved in [[coronary heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belland RJ, Ouellette SP, Gieffers J, Byrne GI | title = Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerosis | journal = Cell Microbiol | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–27 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14706098 | doi = 10.1046/j.1462-5822.2003.00352.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some species, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Burkholderia cenocepacia]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium avium complex|Mycobacterium avium]]'', are [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogens]] and cause disease mainly in people suffering from [[immunosuppression]] or [[cystic fibrosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heise ER | title = Diseases associated with immunosuppression | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 43 | pages = 9–19 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7037390 | pmc = 1568899 | doi = 10.2307/3429162 | jstor = 3429162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saiman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saiman L | title = Microbiology of early CF lung disease | journal = Paediatric Respiratory Reviews | volume = 5 Suppl A | pages = S367–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14980298 | doi = 10.1016/S1526-0542(04)90065-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacterial infections may be treated with [[antibiotic]]s, which are classified as [[Bactericide|bacteriocidal]] if they kill bacteria, or [[bacteriostatic]] if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are [[chloramphenicol]] and [[puromycin]], which inhibit the bacterial [[ribosome]], but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yonath A, Bashan A | title = Ribosomal crystallography: initiation, peptide bond formation, and amino acid polymerization are hampered by antibiotics | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 58 | pages = 233–51 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15487937 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123822 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in [[intensive farming]] to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of [[antibiotic resistance]] in bacterial populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khachatourians GG | title = Agricultural use of antibiotics and the evolution and transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria | journal = CMAJ | volume = 159 | issue = 9 | pages = 1129–36 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9835883 | pmc = 1229782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infections can be prevented by [[antiseptic]] measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilised]] to prevent contamination by bacteria. [[Disinfectant]]s such as [[bleach]] are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.

==Significance in technology and industry==
{{further|Economic importance of bacteria}}
Bacteria, often [[lactic acid bacteria]], such as ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' and ''[[Lactococcus]]'', in combination with [[yeast]]s and [[mold|mould]]s, have been used for thousands of years in the preparation of [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] foods, such as [[cheese]], [[Pickling|pickle]]s, [[soy sauce]], [[sauerkraut]], [[vinegar]], [[wine]] and [[yogurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson ME, Lucey JA | title = Major technological advances and trends in cheese | journal = J Dairy Sci | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 1174–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16537950 | doi = 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72186-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hagedorn S, Kaphammer B | title = Microbial biocatalysis in the generation of flavor and fragrance chemicals | journal = Annu.

The ability of bacteria to degrade a variety of organic compounds is remarkable and has been used in waste processing and [[bioremediation]]. Bacteria capable of digesting the [[hydrocarbon]]s in [[petroleum]] are often used to clean up [[oil spill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen Y | title = Bioremediation of oil by marine microbial mats | journal = Int Microbiol | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 189–93 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12497184 | doi = 10.1007/s10123-002-0089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in [[Prince William Sound]] in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]]. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the [[bioremediation]] of industrial [[toxic waste]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neves LC, Miyamura TT, Moraes DA, Penna TC, Converti A | title = Biofiltration methods for the removal of phenolic residues | journal = Appl.

Bacteria can also be used in the place of [[pesticide]]s in the [[biological pest control]]. This commonly involves ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium.

Because of their ability to quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]]. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, [[enzyme]]s and [[metabolic pathway]]s in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Serres MH, Gopal S, Nahum LA, Liang P, Gaasterland T, Riley M | title = A functional update of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = research0035.1–research0035.7 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11574054 | pmc = 56896 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2001-2-9-research0035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme kinetic]] and [[gene expression]] data into [[mathematical model]]s of entire organisms.

Because of their importance for research in general, samples of bacterial strains are isolated and preserved in [[Biological Resource Centers]]. This ensures the availability of the strain to scientists worldwide.

Bacteria were first observed by the Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1676, using a single-lens [[microscope]] of his own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porter JR | title = Antony van Leeuwenhoek: tercentenary of his discovery of bacteria | journal = Bacteriological Reviews | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 260–9 | year = 1976 | pmid = 786250 | pmc = 413956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then published his observations in a series of letters to the [[Royal Society of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstl.1684.0030 |vauthors=van Leeuwenhoek A |title=An abstract of a letter from Mr. Anthony Leevvenhoek at Delft, dated Sep. 17, 1683, Containing Some Microscopical Observations, about Animals in the Scurf of the Teeth, the Substance Call'd Worms in the Nose, the Cuticula Consisting of Scales |journal=Philosophical Transactions (1683–1775) |volume=14 |pages=568–574 |year=1684 |issue=155–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Leeuwenhoek A |title=Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, concerning the Worms in Sheeps Livers, Gnats, and Animalcula in the Excrements of Frogs |journal=Philosophical Transactions (1683–1775) |volume=22 |pages=509–518 |year=1700 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1700.0013 |issue=260–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Leeuwenhoek A |title=Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, F.

They were just at the limit of what his simple lenses could make out and, in one of the most striking hiatuses in the history of science, no one else would see them again for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac Asimov|Asimov, Isaac]] (1982), ''[[Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology]]'', 2nd edition, [[Garden City, New York]]: [[Doubleday and Company]], pg 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Only then were his by-then-largely-forgotten observations of bacteria&amp;nbsp;— as opposed to his famous &quot;[[animalcule]]s&quot; ([[spermatozoa]])&amp;nbsp;— taken seriously.

[[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] introduced the word &quot;bacterium&quot; in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;
Ehrenberg's Symbolae Physioe. Animalia evertebrata. Decas prima. Berlin, 1828.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, his ''[[Bacterium (genus)|Bacterium]]'' was a genus that contained non-spore-forming rod-shaped bacteria,&lt;ref name=status&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Breed RS, Conn HJ | title = The Status of the Generic Term Bacterium Ehrenberg 1828 | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 517–518 | year = 1936 | pmid = 16559906 | pmc = 543738 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to ''Bacillus'', a genus of spore-forming rod-shaped bacteria defined by Ehrenberg in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;EHRENBERG (C.G.): Dritter Beitrag zur Erkenntniss grosser Organisation in der Richtung des kleinsten Raumes. Physikalische Abhandlungen der Koeniglichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin aus den Jahren 1833–1835, 1835, pp. 143–336.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Pasteur]] demonstrated in 1859 that the growth of microorganisms causes the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] process, and that this growth is not due to [[spontaneous generation]]. ([[Yeast]]s and [[mold|mould]]s, commonly associated with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather [[fungus|fungi]].) Along with his contemporary [[Robert Koch]], Pasteur was an early advocate of the [[germ theory of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cphl/history/articles/pasteur.htm#paperII|title = Pasteur's Papers on the Germ Theory|publisher = LSU Law Center's Medical and Public Health Law Site, Historic Public Health Articles|accessdate = 23 November 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061218123426/http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cphl/history/articles/pasteur.htm| archivedate= 18 December 2006 | deadurl= no}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Koch, a pioneer in medical microbiology, worked on [[cholera]], [[anthrax]] and [[tuberculosis]]. In his research into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/|title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905|publisher = Nobelprize.org|accessdate = 22 November 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061210184150/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/| archivedate= 10 December 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Koch's postulates]]'', he set out criteria to test if an organism is the cause of a [[disease]], and these postulates are still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Brien SJ, Goedert JJ | title = HIV causes AIDS: Koch's postulates fulfilled | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 613–8 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8902385 | doi = 10.1016/S0952-7915(96)80075-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it was known in the nineteenth century that bacteria are the cause of many diseases, no effective [[antiseptic|antibacterial]] treatments were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thurston AJ | title = Of blood, inflammation and gunshot wounds: the history of the control of sepsis | journal = Aust N Z J Surg | volume = 70 | issue = 12 | pages = 855–61 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11167573 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1622.2000.01983.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, [[Paul Ehrlich]] developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained ''[[Treponema pallidum]]''&amp;nbsp;— the [[spirochaete]] that causes [[syphilis]]&amp;nbsp;— into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwartz RS | title = Paul Ehrlich's magic bullets | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 350 | issue = 11 | pages = 1079–80 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15014180 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp048021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on [[immunology]], and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the [[Gram stain]] and the [[Ziehl–Neelsen stain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/ehrlich-bio.html|title = Biography of Paul Ehrlich|publisher = Nobelprize.org|accessdate = 26 November 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061128093700/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/ehrlich-bio.html| archivedate= 28 November 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major step forward in the study of bacteria came in 1977 when [[Carl Woese]] recognised that [[archaea]] have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria.&lt;ref name=Woese1977&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woese CR, Fox GE | title = Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: the primary kingdoms | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 5088–90 | year = 1977 | pmid = 270744 | pmc = 432104 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088 | bibcode = 1977PNAS...74.5088W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new [[phylogenetic]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] depended on the [[sequencing]] of [[16S ribosomal RNA]], and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the [[three-domain system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Woese&quot;/&gt;
