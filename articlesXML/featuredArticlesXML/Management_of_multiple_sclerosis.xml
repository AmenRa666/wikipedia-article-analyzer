[[Multiple sclerosis]] (MS) is a [[chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[demyelinating disease]] that affects the [[Central Nervous System|central nervous system]] (CNS). Several therapies for exist, although there is no known cure.

The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable attacks ([[relapse]]s) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, many of the people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a [[diagnosis]] of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.

The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS may have several [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]], and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different [[Alternative medicine|alternative treatments]] are pursued by many people, despite the fact that there is little supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study. Stem cell therapy is being studied.

This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; [[idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases|borderline forms of MS]] have particular treatments that are excluded.

Administration of high doses of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]], is the routine therapy for acute relapses. This is administered over a period of three to five days, and has a well-established [[efficacy]] in promoting a faster recovery from [[disability]] after an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sellebjerg F, Barnes D, Filippini G, etal |title=EFNS guideline on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses: report of an EFNS task force on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses |journal=Eur.

In 2010 [[fingolimod]], a [[S1PR1|sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor]] modulator, became the first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by [[teriflunomide]], a drug that inhibits the synthesis of [[pyrimidine]] and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fingolimod&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aubagio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Zeyda M, Poglitsch M, Geyeregger R, Smolen JS, Zlabinger GJ, Hörl WH, Waldhäusl W, Stulnig TM, Säemann MD|title=Disruption of the interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells by the active leflunomide metabolite teriflunomide: involvement of impaired integrin activation and immunologic synapse formation|journal=Arthritis Rheum|year=2005|volume=52|issue=9|pages=2730–2739|doi=10.1002/art.21255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22014437&quot;/&gt; Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose.&lt;ref name=Aubagio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gylenya medication guide|date=May 2012|publisher=Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation|url=http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/cs/www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/gilenya.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2013|page=2|format=pdf|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of [[fumaric acid]], an already existing drug), was approved by the FDA.

Another oral drug, [[cladribine]], was approved in Russia and Australia in 2010. Its application was rejected by the FDA and EMEA in 2011 due to safety concerns in spite of the promising efficacy of the drug. This led the pharmaceutical to discontinue commercialization and withdraw all marketing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Comi|first=G|author2=Hartung, HP |author3=Kurukulasuriya, NC |author4=Greenberg, SJ |author5= Scaramozza, M |title=Cladribine tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.|journal=Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy|date=January 2013|volume=14|issue=1|pages=123–36|pmid=23256518|doi=10.1517/14656566.2013.754012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Copaxone Injection Site Reaction.JPG|right|thumb|Irritation zone after injection of glatiramer acetate.]]

Both the interferons and glatiramer acetate are available only in injectable forms, and both can cause skin reactions at the injection site, specially with subcutaneous administration.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20687620&quot;/&gt; Skin reactions vary greatly in their clinical presentation and may include bruising, [[erythema]], pain, [[pruritus]], irritation, swelling and in the most extreme cases cutaneous [[necrosis]].&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20687620&quot;/&gt;  They usually appear within the first month of treatment albeit their frequence and importance diminish after six months of use.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt; Mild skin reactions usually do not impede treatment whereas necroses appear in around 5% of patients and lead to the discontinuation of the therapy.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt; Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as [[lipoatrophy]], may develop.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt;

[[Interferon]]s, a subclass of [[cytokines]], are produced in the body during illnesses such as [[influenza]] in order to help fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including [[fever]], [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[headache]]s.&lt;ref name='pmid16253889'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eccles|first=R|title=Understanding the symptoms of the common cold and influenza.|journal=The Lancet infectious diseases|date=November 2005|volume=5|issue=11|pages=718–25|pmid=16253889|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(05)70270-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10563602&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=EU|author2=Hohlfeld, R|title=Multiple sclerosis: side effects of interferon beta therapy and their management.|journal=Neurology|date=10 November 1999|volume=53|issue=8|pages=1622–7|pmid=10563602|doi=10.1212/wnl.53.8.1622}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, such as [[ibuprofen]], that reduce fever and pain.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt; Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt; Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress ([[Uhthoff's phenomenon]]), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt; A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is [[spasticity]].&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt; Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of [[white blood cell]]s ([[leukopenia]]), [[lymphocyte]]s ([[lymphopenia]]) and [[neutrophil]]s ([[neutropenia]]), as well as affect [[liver]] function.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt; In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt; Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory [[Blood test|blood analyses]], including [[liver function tests]], to ensure safe use of interferons.&lt;ref name=pmid10563602/&gt;

Mitoxantrone therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related [[cardiotoxicity|cardiac toxicity]]. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring [[guideline (medical)|guidelines]] is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an [[echocardiogram]] and a [[complete blood count]] before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, [[infection]] or liver dysfunction during therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16750460&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fox EJ |title=Management of worsening multiple sclerosis with mitoxantrone: a review |journal=Clinical therapeutics |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=461–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16750460 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.04.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinically isolated syndrome ===
The earliest clinical presentation of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack of a single symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of [[demyelination]] but the patient does not fulfill the [[McDonald criteria|criteria]] for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15847841&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller D, Barkhof F, Montalban X, Thompson A, Filippi M |title=Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=281–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15847841 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70071-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment with [[interferon]]s or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases the risk of developing clinical definite MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name='pmid21205678'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=D|title=Treatment effects of immunomodulatory therapies at different stages of multiple sclerosis in short-term trials.|journal=Neurology|date=4 January 2011|volume=76|issue=1 Suppl 1|pages=S14-25|pmid=21205678|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182050388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relapsing-remitting MS ===
Medications are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using [[gadolinium]]-[[MRI contrast agent|enhanced]] [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies.

Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are considered highly effective both in terms of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%.&lt;ref name='&quot;pmid21777829&quot;'/&gt; Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Even with appropriate use of medication, to varying degrees most patients with relapsing-remitting MS still suffer from some attacks and many suffer subsequent disability.

=== Secondary progressive MS and progressive relapsing MS ===
[[File:Mitoxantrone skeletal.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of mitoxantrone]]

Treatment of advanced forms of MS is more difficult than relapsing-remitting MS. A wide range of medications have been used to try to slow the progression of the disease, with results that have been at best fair.

Mitoxantrone has shown positive effects in people with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression of the disease and the frequency of relapses in people after two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinelli Boneschi|first1=F|last2=Vacchi|first2=L|last3=Rovaris|first3=M|last4=Capra|first4=R|last5=Comi|first5=G|title=Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=31 May 2013|volume=5|pages=CD002127|pmid=23728638|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002127.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 it was the only medication approved in the USA for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent [[cardiotoxicity|cardiac toxicity]] which limits its long-term use. It is also not approved in Europe. Natalizumab has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive MS with relapses. Studies on the use of Interferon-beta-1b in secondary progressive and progressive relapsing  MS do not support that it slows progression of the disease, although it is effective in reducing the number of relapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=La Mantia|first1=L|last2=Vacchi|first2=L|last3=Di Pietrantonj|first3=C|last4=Ebers|first4=G|last5=Rovaris|first5=M|last6=Fredrikson|first6=S|last7=Filippini|first7=G|title=Interferon beta for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=18 January 2012|volume=1|pages=CD005181|pmid=22258960|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005181.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary progressive MS ===
Treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients do not respond to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or [[riluzole]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696013.html Riluzole.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) (1 April 2003).

== Managing the effects of MS ==
Disease-modifying treatments only reduce the progression rate of the disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and [[Disability|handicap]]. Management of these deficits is therefore very important.

=== Rehabilitation ===

==== Physical therapy ====
Symptoms of MS that can be improved include [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[spasticity]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], bladder dysfunction, and neurological symptoms. These symptoms can be improved by physical therapy and medication. Physical therapists can show strengthening exercises and ways to stretch; ultimately making daily tasks easier and reduces fatigue while muscle strength increases as flexibility increases.&lt;ref&gt;Rietberg, M. &amp; Brooks, D. &amp; Uitdehaag, B. &amp; Kwakkel, G. 18 Mar 2004.

Retrieved from; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003980.pub2/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; Medications can help fatigue, muscle tightness (spasticity), depression, bladder dysfunction, and neurological symptoms.  All symptoms are common amongst MS patients.

Both drug therapy and [[neurorehabilitation]] have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms, even though neither influence disease progression. For other symptoms the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16168933&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kesselring J, Beer S |title=Symptomatic therapy and neurorehabilitation in multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=643–52 |year=2005 |pmid=16168933 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70193-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An elevated core temperature, leading to increased symptom presentation has been noted during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS during the course of exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Davis, SL; Wilson, TE; White, AT; Frohman, EM|title=Thermoregulation in multiple sclerosis.|journal=Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)|date=November 2010|volume=109|issue=5|pages=1531–7|pmid=20671034|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00460.2010|pmc=2980380}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.

=== Medical treatments for symptoms ===
{{further|Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms}}

Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation ([[hypoesthesia]]), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as [[dysarthria]]) or swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), visual problems ([[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[optic neuritis]], or [[diplopia]]), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and acute or chronic [[pain]] syndromes, [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and [[bowel]] difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly [[clinical depression|depression]]). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on the patient and the physician.

Research directions on MS treatments include investigations of MS pathogenesis and heterogeneity; research of more effective, convenient, or tolerable new treatments for RRMS; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes; neuroprotection strategies; and the search for effective symptomatic treatments.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19597083&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen JA |title=Emerging therapies for relapsing multiple sclerosis |journal=Arch.

Advances during the last decades has led to the recent approval of several oral drugs.

Monoclonal antibodies, which are drugs of the same family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of interest and research. [[Alemtuzumab]], [[daclizumab]] and [[CD20]] monoclonal antibodies such as [[rituximab]], [[ocrelizumab]] and [[ofatumumab]] have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22224673&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saidha S, Eckstein C, Calabresi PA |title=New and emerging disease modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1247 |issue= |pages=117–37 |date=January 2012 |pmid=22224673 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06272.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied by the appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21425270&quot;/&gt; Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against [[JC virus]] antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21425270&quot;/&gt; While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21425270&quot;/&gt;

Another research strategy is to evaluate the [[combination therapy|combined effectiveness]] of two or more drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21111490&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milo R, Panitch H |title=Combination therapy in multiple sclerosis |journal=J.

Nevertheless, there can also appear important drawbacks such as antagonizing mechanisms of action or potentiation of deleterious secondary effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21111490&quot;/&gt; While there have been several clinical trials of combined therapy none has shown positive enough effects to merit the consideration as a viable treatment for MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21111490&quot;/&gt;

Finally, regarding neuroprotective and specially regenerative treatments, such as [[stem cell therapy]], while their research is considered of high importance at the moment they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23039386&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Luessi F, Siffrin V, Zipp F |title=Neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis: novel treatment strategies |journal=Expert Rev Neurother |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=1061–76; quiz 1077 |date=September 2012 |pmid=23039386 |doi=10.1586/ern.12.59 |url=http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/full/10.1586/ern.12.59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21425270&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, vascular surgeon [[Paolo Zamboni]] suggested that MS involves a [[Circulatory system|vascular]] process he referred to as [[chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency]] (CCSVI), in which veins from the brain are constricted. He found CCSVI in all patients with MS in his study, performed a surgical procedure, later called in the media &quot;liberation procedure&quot; to correct it and claimed that 73% of participants improved.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19060024&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Zamboni P, Galeotti R, Menegatti E, etal |title=Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=J.

== Alternative treatments ==
Over 50% of MS patients may use [[complementary and alternative medicine]], although numbers vary greatly depending on the definition of alternative medicine used.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16420779&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huntley A |title=A review of the evidence for efficacy of complementary and alternative medicines in MS |journal=Int MS J |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=5–12, 4 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16420779 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it is estimated that 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control.&lt;ref name = &quot;US CAM&quot;&gt;[http://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/alternative-treatment#Overview1 Overview of CAM for management of MS] Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Management Overview (Healthline) (28 July 2014).

The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.&lt;ref name = &quot;VitaminD MS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierrot-Deseilligny|first=Charles|author2=Souberbielle, Jean-Claude |title= Contribution of vitamin D insufficiency to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis |journal=Ther Adv Neurol Disord|date=Mar 2013|volume=6|issue=2|pages=81–116|doi= 10.1177/1756285612473513}}&lt;/ref&gt;
