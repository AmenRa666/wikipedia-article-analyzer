The '''''Liber Eliensis''''' (sometimes '''''Historia Eliensis'''''&lt;ref name=Introxiii&gt;Fairweather &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Book of Ely''''') is a 12th-century English chronicle and history, written in [[medieval Latin|Latin]]. Composed in three books, it was written at [[Ely Abbey]] on the island of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] in the [[The Fens|fenland]]s of eastern [[Cambridgeshire]]. Ely Abbey became the [[Ely Cathedral|cathedral]] of a newly formed [[Diocese of Ely|bishopric]] in 1109. Traditionally the author of the anonymous work has been given as Richard or Thomas, two monks at Ely, one of whom, Richard, has been identified with an official of the monastery, but some historians hold that neither Richard nor Thomas was the author.

The ''Liber'' covers the period from the founding of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of [[hagiography|saints' lives]]. The work typifies a type of local history produced during the latter part of the 12th century. Similar books were written at other English monasteries. The longest of the contemporary local histories, the ''Liber'' chronicles the devastation that [[the Anarchy]] caused during the reign of King [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]]. It also documents the career of [[Nigel of Ely|Nigel]], the [[Bishop of Ely]] from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes include the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, [[Æthelthryth]], and gifts of land to Ely.

Two complete manuscripts survive, complemented by partial manuscripts. The Latin text was published in 1962, and an English translation followed in 2005. Extracts had appeared in print earlier.

The ''Liber Eliensis'' provides an important history of the region and period it covers, and particularly for the abbey and bishopric of Ely.

==Background and authorship==
[[File:Ely Cathedral by John Buckler.JPG|right|thumb|Early 19th-century print of [[Ely Cathedral]], where the ''Liber Eliensis'' was produced]]

The ''Liber Eliensis'' was written at Ely Abbey, which became [[Ely Cathedral]] upon conversion into a bishopric in 1109.&lt;ref name=Stafford20&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stafford180&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Elisabeth van Houts believes that it was written in two stages: first under Bishop [[Hervey le Breton]], in office from 1109 to 1133; and continued under Bishop [[Geoffrey Ridel (bishop of Ely)|Geoffrey Ridel]], who served from 1173 to 1189. For van Houts, the first stage was the translation of an [[Old English]] work into Latin, commissioned by Bishop Hervey. The rest of the work, van Houts argues, was composed in the 1170s.&lt;ref name=Houts110&gt;van Houts &quot;Historical Writing&quot; ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; However, E. O. Blake, who edited the first Latin printing of the work, concludes that the ''Liber'' was probably composed in three parts, based on its contents; the first book of the ''Liber'' was begun after 1131, when one of the sources used in the ''Liber'' was completed. The second has a preface apologising for the delay in its completion, and could not have been started before 1154, as it records events from that year. The third and final book was completed between 1169, when Bishop Nigel died and whose death is mentioned in the book, and 1174, when a new bishop was appointed. As there is no mention of Nigel's replacement, Blake states that this suggests that book three was finished before the new bishop took office.&lt;ref name=Blakexlvi&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xlvi–xlix&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally the work was ascribed to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text.&lt;ref name=Introxvii&gt;Fairweather &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Antonia Gransden]] is inclined to believe that the work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and [[prior]] of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194.&lt;ref name=Gransden271&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Blakexlvi/&gt; Janet Fairweather, a [[classicist]] and a recent translator of the ''Liber'', suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates.&lt;ref name=Introxvii/&gt; Whoever the author, the ''Liber'' specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.&lt;ref name=Gransden272&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Liber'' is one of a number of monastic histories written during the middle and later 12th century, when a number of monasteries in northern and southern England produced works devoted to recording the histories of their religious houses and local areas. In the south, these included the ''[[Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis]]'' of [[Abingdon Abbey]], the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis]]'' of [[Ramsey Abbey]], the ''[[Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense]]'' of [[Peterborough Abbey]], a history of the [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Diocese of Bath and Wells|Bath and Wells]], and the ''[[Chronicon Monasterii de Bello]]'' of [[Battle Abbey]]. The northern histories record the [[foundation stories]] of the various [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] houses in the north, along with other information relating to those houses. Those from the south, including the ''Liber Eliensis'', mainly concern themselves with the various controversies involving their respective religious houses. The northern histories are less concerned with controversy, and overall are more prone to [[hagiography]].&lt;ref name=Gransden269&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

To a large extent the work is composite; that is, it is a compilation borrowing from or at least using&lt;!--a difference?--&gt; earlier sources. These include the early medieval writer [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', a chronicle that was associated with Bede's ''[[De temporum ratione]]'', the ''[[Chronicon ex chronicis]]'', and [[William of Poitiers]]' ''Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum''. Lesser-used sources include the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', [[Orderic Vitalis]]' ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Stephen of Ripon's ''[[Vita Sancti Wilfrithi]]'', [[William of Malmesbury]]'s ''[[Gesta pontificum Anglorum]]'', a list of the [[King of Wessex|kings of Wessex]], the Old English poem ''[[The Battle of Maldon]]'', and a number of saints' lives, including some written by [[Eadmer]], Felix, [[Abbo of Fleury]], [[Goscelin]], and [[Osbern of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxviii&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxviii–xxix&lt;/ref&gt; The work on Maldon was included because the hero of the work was [[Byrhtnoth]], a patron of the monastery.&lt;ref name=Gransden274&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Works more directly related to Ely were also used. The primary one of these works was Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]]'s ''Libellus'', large parts of which were copied into the ''Liber Eliensis''.&lt;ref name=Stafford16&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Also incorporated into the ''Liber'' was an earlier ''Vita'', or saints' life, on Æthelthryth, the founder and first abbess of Ely.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxx&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxx–xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; A work on the benefactors of the abbey was also used,&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxxviii&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt; and the material from three surviving [[cartulary|cartularies]].&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxxix&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; These documents were translated from their original Old English into Latin by the compiler.&lt;ref name=Gransden274/&gt; Another source, as related in the ''Liber'' itself, was a work about [[Hereward the Wake]] written by a brother monk known as Richard. Modern historians have identified it with the ''[[Gesta Herwardi]]'' known from a 13th-century manuscript. It is, however, unclear whether the compiler of the ''Liber'' used the exact text of the ''Gesta'' as it has come down to us, or a different, earlier manuscript.&lt;ref name=Houts202&gt;van Houts &quot;Hereward and Flanders&quot; ''Anglo-Saxon England 28'' pp. 202–204&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these sources may originally have been oral works. A number of the stories in the narrative parts of the ''Liber'' resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It is possible that the information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.&lt;ref name=Gransden275&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:EmmaNormanská.jpg|A 13th-century representation of [[Emma of Normandy]], whose benefactions to Ely were recorded in the ''Liber''|thumb|upright|left]]

The work is traditionally divided into three books. Along with the history in Book I the first section also contains a prologue and a preface. It discusses the founding of the Abbey of Ely and the background of the foundress, Æthelthryth. The first book also deals with the history of the abbey and its abbesses until the Danish invasions of the 9th century. A description of the destruction of the abbey by the Danes and of King [[Edgar the Peaceable|Edgar's]] (reigned 959–975) rule concludes the book.&lt;ref name=LE9&gt;Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; The second book, Book II, begins with the restoration of the abbey during Edgar's reign, under Bishop Æthelwold. Accounts of the subsequent abbots until the last, Richard, are included in Book II, as well as numerous charters and other documents.&lt;ref name=LE85&gt;Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. 85–95&lt;/ref&gt; The final book, Book III, contains information on the conversion of the abbey to a bishopric, and on the first few bishops; it concludes with a description of the martyrdom of [[Thomas Becket]]. Interspersed with the historical narrative are a number of documents and charters relating to the bishops.&lt;ref name=LE286&gt;Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. 286–296&lt;/ref&gt;

The work also depicts the devastation that [[the Anarchy]] caused during King [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen's]] reign. The chronicler states that failure of the harvest and pillaging caused a [[famine]]. The work describes the area around the abbey for {{convert|20|–|30|mi|km|abbr=off}} as being filled with unburied corpses, and that the price of a bushel of grain rose to 200&amp;nbsp;[[penny (English coin)|pence]]. The long descriptions of Nigel of Ely's disputes with King Stephen lead to a discussion of the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] and other matters not directly related to Ely. The ''Liber'' gives a detailed account of Nigel's career, although in general the chronicle's author favours Stephen over his own bishop. The ascension of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] to the English throne is considered to be an excellent event, and the ''Liber'' praises the new king.&lt;ref name=Gransden280&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier ''Vita'', or ''Life'', of Æthelthryth, which resembles the ''Vitae'' of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely.&lt;ref name=Gransden282&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; The work may have helped to increase the number of pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King [[Æthelred the Unready|Æthelred II]] (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift.&lt;ref name=Gransden284&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the ''Liber'' would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation.&lt;ref name=Pax124&gt;Paxton &quot;Textual Communities&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XXVI'' p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the ''Liber''.&lt;ref name=Pax128&gt;Paxton &quot;Textual Communities&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XXVI'' p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern of the chronicle was the acquisition of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The ''Liber'' was used by the monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate.&lt;ref name=Gransden283&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' pp. 283–284&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various [[Bishop of Lincoln|Bishops of Lincoln]], which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.&lt;ref name=Gransden286&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme of the work is the stress on the importance and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The ''Liber'' stresses the burials of [[Athelstan (bishop)|Æthelstan]], a [[Bishop of Elmham]], that of [[Ælfwine of Elmham|Ælfwine]], another Bishop of Elmham, and [[Wulfstan II]], an [[Archbishop of York]].&lt;ref name=Pax132&gt;Paxton &quot;Textual Communities&quot; ''Anglo-Norman Studies XXVI'' pp. 132–134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Matthew Paris 02.jpg|right|thumb|The medieval chronicler, [[Matthew Paris]], shown here in a 13th-century manuscript depiction of his deathbed, used the ''Liber'' as a source for his works.]]

The ''Liber'' was familiar to the 13th-century chronicler [[Matthew Paris]], who used it along with the ''Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis'' of Ramsey Abbey in his own historical works. Another 13th-century English writer, [[Roger of Wendover]], was also aware of the ''Liber''.&lt;ref name=Gransden374&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 374 and footnote 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the information contained in the ''Liber'' is important to historians. It is in the ''Liber'' that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the ''[[Benedictine Rule]]'' into Old English is made.&lt;ref name=Gneuss73&gt;Gneuss &quot;Origin of Standard Old English&quot; ''Anglo-Saxon England 1'' pp. 73–74 and footnote 3&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Liber'' is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century,&lt;ref name=Gransden270/&gt; and it contains a description of the royal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The ''Liber'' describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of [[chancellor]] (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear.&lt;ref name=Gransden276&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] is a matter of some debate amongst historians.&lt;ref name=Rankin&gt;Rankin &quot;Chancery, Royal&quot; ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Dorothy Whitelock]] says of the work that it is &quot;unique among post-Conquest monastic histories&quot;.&lt;ref name=QTexts&gt;Quoted in Royal Historical Society ''Texts and Calendars II'' p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; It was written to help buttress the claims of Ely to a [[Liberty (division)|judicial liberty]],&lt;ref name=CamIntroxlix/&gt; or the exercise of all the royal rights within a [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]].&lt;ref name=Warren46&gt;Warren ''Governance'' pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, the ''Liber'' collected together earlier sources used to help the abbey evade episcopal control, prior to the abbey becoming a bishopric. These documents may have been forged or had their contents doctored to help the abbey's cause. Because of the tendentious nature of the collection, the work is used by historians with great caution.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxlix&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xlix–l&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the untrustworthy nature of the ''Liber'' and the documents preserved therein, it remains a valuable source for the history of the time period it covers, as well as the internal history of the abbey and bishopric.&lt;ref name=CamIntroliii&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. liii–liv&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Antonia Gransden characterises the ''Liber'' as &quot;valuable for general history&quot;, but qualifies by saying that &quot;the whole lacks unity and has errors and confusing repetitions&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gransden270&gt;Gransden ''Historical Writing'' p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==

The work survives in two complete manuscripts (MS), that of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] MS O.2.1, usually known as the E manuscript; and one in the possession of [[Ely Cathedral|Ely Cathedral Chapter]], usually known as the F manuscript. The E manuscript dates from the late 12th century, and shows three different [[Hand (handwriting)|scribal hands]].{{efn|The manuscript is on [[vellum]] on 256 [[folio]]s in a single column with initials in green and red ink. Besides the ''Liber'', the manuscript also has 14 folios at the front which are unnumbered and consist of a [[Calendar of saints]] and a list of bishops and abbots of Ely. Then there follow the folios with the ''Liber'' itself, numbered 1-177. The last parts of the manuscript contains the ''[[Inquisitio Eliensis]]'' and short ''[[hagiography|vitae]]'' on the saints [[Ædelberga]], [[Ærcongota]], [[Ærmenilda]], [[Seaxburh of Ely|Sexburga]], [[Werburga]], and [[Wihtburh|Wihtburga]].&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxiii/&gt;}} The F manuscript dates to the early 13th century, with four scribal hands.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxiii&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxiii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This manuscript is on vellum also and consists of 190 folios, numbered 1-188 as two folio numbers have been used twice. The text is in two columns with initial letters mainly in green and red with some in blue. The first folio is not part of the ''Liber'' and consists of notes on various subjects, including the [[Confessor of the Faith|confessor]]s buried at Ely and the rights of the convent on the [[Isle of Ely]]. Folios 2-188v are the ''Liber'' proper which is followed by a charter from around 1200 and a note from the 15th century.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxiii/&gt;}} The E manuscript was given to Trinity College as part of the Gale Collection by [[Roger Gale (antiquary)|Roger Gale]] in 1738.&lt;ref name=TrinityCatalog&gt;Staff &quot;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130703165311/http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/james/show.php?index=629 Liber Eliensis]&quot; ''Trinity Library Catalogue''&lt;/ref&gt; The F manuscript has remained at Ely since its creation, and is the only manuscript at Ely still remaining from the medieval monastic library.&lt;ref name=Library4&gt;Owen ''Library and Muniments of Ely Cathedral'' p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the two complete manuscripts, a number of other manuscripts contain parts of the whole work. [[British Library]] MS [[Cotton library|Cotton]] Titus A.i, usually known as the G&amp;nbsp;manuscript, has part of Book II, and dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. British Library MS Cotton Domitian A.xv, known as the B manuscript, dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and includes some other material along with Book I and the same parts of Book II as in manuscript G. Another Cottonian manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Vespasian A.xix, has parts of Book III, and dates to between 1257 and 1286.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxv&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript is usually known as the A manuscript.&lt;ref name=Introxxv&gt;Fairweather &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts relate to each other cannot be made.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxlii&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xlii&lt;/ref&gt; Blake, in his edition of the ''Liber'', suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or an earlier version of that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxlvi&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xlvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Related manuscripts include [[Bodleian Library]] Oxford MS Laud 647, known as the O manuscript.&lt;ref name=Introxxv/&gt;{{efn|This manuscript is also on vellum in 188 folios in double columned text. The initials alternate in red and blue ink and are elaborately decorated. The actual ''Liber'' takes up folios 3-177v in this manuscript.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxvi/&gt;}} This is based on the ''Liber'', but reorganised into a listing of the acts of the various abbots and bishops and dates from the 14th century. Blake, in his edition of the ''Liber'', calls that and related works the ''Chronicon Abbatum et Episcoporum Eliensium''.&lt;ref name=CamIntroxxvi&gt;Blake &quot;Introduction&quot; ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxv–xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Another related work is contained in Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.41, which contains the ''Libellus'' of Æthelwold and an Ely cartulary. Two other related works containing just cartularies are British Library [[Cotton MS Tiberius]] A vi and Cambridge University Library Ely Diocesan Register Liber M.&lt;ref name=Introxxv/&gt;
