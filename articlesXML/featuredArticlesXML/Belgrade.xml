[[Lithic reduction|Chipped stone tools]] found at [[Zemun]] show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by [[hunter-gatherer|nomadic foragers]] in the [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] eras. Some of these tools belong to the [[Mousterian|Mousterian industry]], which are associated with [[Neanderthals]] rather than modern humans. [[Aurignacian]] and [[Gravettian]] tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Josip 2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Saric |first1=J. |doi=10.2298/STA0858009S |title=Paleolithic and mesolithic finds from profile of the Zemun loess |journal=Starinar |issue=58 |pages=9–9 |year=2008 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the [[Neolithic]] [[Starčevo culture]], which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapman 2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fragmentation in Archaeology: People, Places, and Broken Objects |last=Chapman |first=John |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-15803-9 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several Starčevo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of [[Starčevo]]. The Starčevo culture was succeeded by the [[Vinča culture]] (5500–4500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Starčevo settlements which is also named for a site in the Belgrade region ([[Vinča-Belo Brdo]]).

King [[Stefan Dragutin of Serbia|Stefan Dragutin]] (r. 1276–1282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, [[Stephen V of Hungary]] in 1284; it served as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Syrmia]], and Dragutin is regarded as the first [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian king]] to rule over Belgrade as a vassal to the Kingdom of Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201247|title=History (Medieval Serbian Belgrade)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the battles at [[Battle of Maritsa|Maritsa (1371)]] and [[Battle of Kosovo|Kosovo field (1389)]], Serbia began to crumble as the Ottoman Empire conquered its southern territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050991/Battle-of-the-Maritsa-River |title=Battle of Maritsa |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=10 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614084904/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050991/Battle-of-the-Maritsa-River |archivedate=14 June 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046112/Battle-of-Kosovo |title=Battle of Kosovo |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=10 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626175037/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046112/Battle-of-Kosovo |archivedate=26 June 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The north resisted through the [[Serbian Despotate]], which had Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under [[Stefan Lazarević]], son of Serbian prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]]. Lazarević built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the [[Despot Stefan Tower|Despot's tower]] and west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist the Ottomans for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population of 40,000 to 50,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSH&quot;/&gt;

In 1427, Stefan's successor [[Đurađ Branković]] had to return Belgrade to the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian king]], and [[Smederevo fortress|Smederevo]] became the new capital.

Seven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] and his 250,000 soldiers; subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to [[Istanbul]],&lt;ref name=&quot;beligrad_history&quot;/&gt; to an area that has since become known as the ''[[Belgrade forest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.co.uk/website/travel/Destination/content/default.aspx?titleid=104&amp;xid=idh573385336_0211|title=The Rough Guide to Turkey: Belgrade Forest|publisher=Rough Guides|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgrade was made the seat of the district ([[Sanjak]]), becoming the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;belgradenet-middleages&quot;/&gt; Ottoman rule also introduced [[Ottoman architecture]], including numerous mosques, increasing the city's [[Oriental]] influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;imperialrule&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201251|title=History (Turkish and Austrian Rule)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1594, a major [[Banat Uprising|Serb rebellion]] was crushed by the Ottomans.

With the [[Principality of Serbia|Principality]]'s full independence in 1878, and its transformation into the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly.&lt;ref name=&quot;bglib&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;20c&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201259|title=History (The Capital of Serbia and Yugoslavia)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia as a whole remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to [[Niš]], Serbia's second city, and in 1900 the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lahmeyer |first=Jan |url=http://www.populstat.info/Europe/yugoslft.htm |title=The Yugoslav Federation: Historical demographical data of the urban centers |publisher=www.populstat.info |date=3 February 2003 |accessdate=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Yet by 1905 the population had grown to more than 80,000, and by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, not counting [[Zemun]] which then belonged to [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Belgrade and Smederevo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]] shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] under General [[Oskar Potiorek]] on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Serbian troops]] under Marshal [[Radomir Putnik]]. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, between 6 and 9 October 1915, Belgrade fell to [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]] on 9 October 1915. The city was liberated by Serbian and [[French Army|French troops]] on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal [[Louis Franchet d'Espérey]] of France and [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia]]. Since Belgrade was decimated as the front-line city, [[Subotica]] overtook the title of the largest city in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom]] for a short while.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkanology.com/serbia/article_vojvodina.html|title=Serbia :: Vojvodina|publisher=Balkanology|accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new ''Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes'', renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1929. The Kingdom was split into [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]], and Belgrade, together with [[Zemun]] and [[Pančevo]], formed a separate administrative unit.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 86-17-09287-4: Kosta Nikolić, Nikola Žutić, Momčilo Pavlović, Zorica Špadijer: Историја за трећи разред гимназије, Belgrade, 2002, pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (incorporating the town of Zemun, formerly in Austria-Hungary), and 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;stan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===World War II===
On 25 March 1941, the government of [[regent]] [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Paul]] signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], joining the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military [[coup d'état]] led by Air Force commander General [[Dušan Simović]], who proclaimed [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] to be of age to rule the realm.

===Socialist Yugoslavia===
During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the [[SFR Yugoslavia|renewed Yugoslavia]], developing as a major industrial center.&lt;ref name=&quot;20c&quot;/&gt; In 1948, construction of [[New Belgrade]] started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Aligned Countries]] was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]] was built. In 1968, [[1968 student demonstrations in Belgrade|major student protests]] led to several street clashes between students and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.boell.eu/downloads/mai_68_uk.pdf |page=49 |last=Popov |first=Nebojša |title=Belgrade, June 1968 |journal=1968 revisited: 40 years of protest movements |publisher=Heinrich Böll Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618055051/http://www.boell.eu/downloads/mai_68_uk.pdf |archivedate=18 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakup of Yugoslavia===

In 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]], [[Operation Allied Force|NATO bombing]]s caused substantial damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were the buildings of several ministries, the [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]] building, several hospitals, the [[Hotel Jugoslavija]], the [[Ušće Tower|Central Committee building]], the [[Avala Tower]], and the [[NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|Chinese embassy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201271|title=NATO bombing|publisher=Official website|accessdate=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these buildings have been left in their bombed states to serve as a memorial for the bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timetravelturtle.com/2013/07/ruined-buildings-from-belgrade-bombing/|title=Ruins of buildings left from Belgrade bombing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential elections]], Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|ousting of president Milošević]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_category=90&amp;nav_id=44315 |title=Parties, citizens mark October 5 |publisher=B92 |date=5 October 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418190114/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_category=90&amp;nav_id=44315 |archivedate=18 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201275|title=October 5, 2000|publisher=City of Belgrade|accessdate=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary period===

In 2014, [[Belgrade Waterfront]] , a catalytic development, has been initiated headed by the [[Government of Serbia]] aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy by revitalizing the Sava amphitheater, a neglected stretch of land on the right bank of the Sava river, between the [[Belgrade Fair]] and [[Belgrade Main railway station]]. Around €3.5 billion will be invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Ekonomija/435629/Ovako-ce-izgledati-Beograd-na-vodi|title=Ovako će izgledati &quot;Beograd na vodi&quot; |publisher=Blic.rs|date=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and Belgrade
Tower.

==Geography==
Belgrade lies {{convert|116.75|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, [[Belgrade Fortress|Kalemegdan]], lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, [[New Belgrade|Novi Beograd]] (''New Belgrade'') was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with [[Zemun]]. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like [[Krnjača]], [[Kotež]] and [[Borča]], also merged with the city, while [[Pančevo]], a heavily industrialized satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of {{convert|360|km2|sqmi}}, while together with its metropolitan area it covers {{convert|3223|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.
{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|1150px|Panoramic view of  the confluence of the Sava River and the Danube from [[Belgrade Fortress]].}}
On the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is [[Torlak (Belgrade)|Torlak hill]] at {{convert|303|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of [[alluvial plain]]s and [[loam|loessial]] [[plateau]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201033 |publisher=City of Belgrade (official website) |title=Natural Features |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{cite conference |url=http://www.geo.uni.lodz.pl/~icuc5/text/P_1_10.pdf |title=Topoclimate and air pollution effects on respiratory diseases occurrences in Belgrade |first=Verica |last=Gburčik |author2=Valentina Gburčik|author3=Ljubinka Marčetić|author4=Slobodan Tošović |publisher=Institute of Public Health of Belgrade |format=PDF}}--&gt;

===Climate===

Belgrade lies in the [[humid subtropical]] (Cfa) just short of a [[Humid continental]] climate (Dfa), [[Köppen climate classification|climate zone]], with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from {{convert|1.4|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|23.0|°C|1}} in July, with an annual mean of {{convert|12.5|°C|1}}. There are, on average, 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30&amp;nbsp;°C, and 95 days when the temperature is above 25&amp;nbsp;°C. Belgrade receives about {{convert|690|mm|0}} of precipitation a year, with late spring being wettest. The average annual number of sunny hours is 2,112.

The highest officially recorded temperature in Belgrade was {{convert|+43.6|C}} on 24 July 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1334095.php/Record-breaking_heat_measured_in_Belgrade |agency=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] |title=Record-breaking heat measured in Belgrade |date=24 July 2007 |accessdate=10 August 2007 |publisher=[[Monsters and Critics]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714085754/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1334095.php/Record-breaking_heat_measured_in_Belgrade |archivedate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while on the other end, the lowest temperature was {{convert|-26.2|°C|0}} on 10 January 1893.&lt;ref name=climate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201193 |title=Climate |publisher=City of Belgrade (official website) |accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipalities===
{{See also|Subdivisions of Belgrade}}

The city is divided into 17 municipalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;municip&quot;/&gt; Previously, they were classified into 10 &quot;urban&quot; (lying completely or partially within borders of the city proper) and 7 &quot;suburban&quot; municipalities, whose centres are smaller towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bačić |first=B.

Most of the municipalities are situated on the southern side of the Danube and [[Sava]] rivers, in the [[Šumadija]] region. Three municipalities ([[Zemun]], [[Novi Beograd]], and [[Surčin]]), are on the northern bank of the Sava, in the [[Syrmia]] region, and the municipality of [[Palilula (Belgrade)|Palilula]], spanning the Danube, is in both the Šumadija and [[Banat]] regions.

Belgrade has wildly varying architecture, from the center of [[Zemun]], typical of a Central European town,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Comrie  |first=Nicholas |last2=Moore |first2=Lucy |title=Zemun: The Town Within the City |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/travel/index.php?nav_id=38986 |publisher=[[B92]] Travel |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the more modern architecture and spacious layout of [[Novi Beograd|New Belgrade]]. The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions.&lt;ref name=manevic&gt;{{cite web|last=Manević |first=Zoran |url=http://web.mit.edu/most/www/ser/Belgrade/zoran_manevic.html |title=Architecture and Building |publisher=[[MIT]] website |accessdate=19 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811101910/http://web.mit.edu/most/www/ser/Belgrade/zoran_manevic.html |archivedate=11 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish [[türbe]], while the oldest house is a modest clay house on [[Dorćol]], from late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mitrović |first=Prof. Dr. Mihajlo |url=http://www.ulus.org.rs/ENGLISH/Exhibitions/TriennialA/TriennialA.htm |title=Seventh Belgrade triennial of world architecture |publisher=ULUS |date=27 June 2003 |accessdate=19 May 2007}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from [[neoclassicism]], [[romanticism]], and [[academic art]]. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the [[National Theatre in Belgrade|National Theatre]], [[Old Palace (Belgrade)|Old Palace]], [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Belgrade)|Cathedral Church]] and later, in the early 20th century, the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]] and [[National Museum of Serbia|National Museum]], influenced by [[art nouveau]].&lt;ref name=manevic/&gt; Elements of [[Neo-Byzantine architecture]] are present in buildings such as [[Vuk's Foundation]], old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as [[St. Mark's Church, Belgrade|St. Mark's Church]] (based on the [[Gračanica monastery]]), and the [[Temple of Saint Sava]].&lt;ref name=manevic/&gt;

During the period of Communist rule, much housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in the [[brutalist architecture]] of the [[blokovi]] (blocks) of New Belgrade; a [[socrealism]] trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the [[Trade Union Hall (Belgrade)|Trade Union Hall]].&lt;ref name=manevic/&gt; However, in the mid-1950s, the [[modernism|modernist]] trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.&lt;ref name=manevic/&gt;

Many weekend visitors—particularly from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]—prefer Belgrade nightlife to that of their own capitals, due to a perceived friendly atmosphere, plentiful clubs and bars, cheap drinks, the lack of language difficulties, and the lack of restrictive night life regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;slovenci&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/pregled_stampe.php?yyyy=2004&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=21&amp;nav_id=158386|title=Slovenci dolaze u jeftin provod|publisher=[[Glas Javnosti]]|date=21 December 2004|language=Serbian|accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hrvati&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji-list.hr/newsroom/news/international/453911/print.do |title=U Beograd na vikend-zabavu|publisher=[[Večernji list]]|date=6 January 2006|language=Croatian|accessdate=15 June 2007|archiveurl=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/pregled_stampe.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=08&amp;nav_id=184523|archivedate=6 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgrade has an extensive public transport system based on buses (118 urban lines and more than 300 suburban lines), trams (12 lines), and [[trolleybus]]es (8 lines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsp.rs/english/statistic.htm |title=Statistics |publisher=Public Transport Company &quot;Belgrade&quot; |accessdate=19 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510071133/http://www.gsp.rs/english/statistic.htm |archivedate=10 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is run by [[GSP Beograd]] and [[Lasta Beograd|SP Lasta]], in cooperation with private companies on various bus routes. The [[BusPlus]] ticketing system based on [[contactless smart card]]s began operating in February 2012. Belgrade also has a [[commuter rail]] network, [[Beovoz]], now run by the city government. The main railway station connects Belgrade with other European capitals and many towns in Serbia. Travel by [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] is also popular, and the capital is well-served with daily connections to every town in Serbia and to many other European destinations through the [[Belgrade Bus Station|central bus station]].

The city is placed along the [[Pan-European corridors]] [[Pan-European Corridor X|X]] and VII.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beograd-invest&quot;/&gt; The motorway system provides for easy access to [[Novi Sad]] and [[Budapest]], in the north; [[Niš]] to the south; and [[Zagreb]], to the west. Situated at the confluence of two major rivers, the Danube and the Sava, Belgrade has 7 bridges—the two main ones are [[Branko's bridge]] and the [[Gazela Bridge]], both of which connect the core of the city to [[New Belgrade]]. With the city's expansion and a substantial increase in the number of vehicles, congestion has become a major problem; this is expected to be alleviated by the construction of a [[Belgrade bypass|bypass]] connecting the [[E70 in Serbia|E70]] and [[E75 in Serbia|E75]] motorways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankwatch.org/project.shtml?w=147584&amp;amp;s=1961998 |title=Belgrade Bypass, Serbia |publisher=CEE Bankwatch network |accessdate=19 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304135012/http://www.bankwatch.org/project.shtml?w=147584&amp;amp;s=1961998 |archivedate=4 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, an &quot;inner magistral semi-ring&quot; is planned, including a new [[Ada Bridge]] across the Sava river, which is expected to ease [[commuting]] within the city and unload the Gazela and Branko's bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebrd.com/projects/eias/34913s.pdf |title=1. faza prve deonice Unutrašnjeg magistralnog poluprstena |publisher=Belgrade Direction for Building and Real Estate Land/EBRD |date=1 July 2005 |accessdate=15 September 2007 |language=Serbian |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809064808/http://www.ebrd.com/projects/eias/34913s.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beovoz]] is the [[regional rail|suburban/commuter railway]] network that provides [[mass-transit]] services in the city, similar to Paris' [[Réseau Express Régional|RER]] and Toronto's [[GO Transit]]. The main usage of today's system is to connect the suburbs with the city centre.

Belgrade was one of the last big European capitals and cities with over a million people to have no metro/subway or other [[rapid transit]] system. The [[Belgrade Metro]] is considered the third most important project in the country, after work on roads and railways. The two projects of highest priority are the [[Belgrade bypass]] and the [[Pan-European Corridor X]].
