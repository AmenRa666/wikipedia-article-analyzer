'''Cherry Springs State Park''' is a {{convert|82|acre|adj=on}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Potter County, Pennsylvania|Potter County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the United States. The park was created from land within the [[Susquehannock State Forest]], and is on [[Pennsylvania Route 44]] in [[West Branch Township, Potter County, Pennsylvania|West Branch Township]]. Cherry Springs, named for a large stand of [[Prunus serotina|Black Cherry]] trees in the park, is atop the [[dissected plateau|dissected]] [[Allegheny Plateau]] at an elevation of {{convert|2300|ft|0}}. It is popular with astronomers and stargazers for having &quot;some of the darkest night skies on the east coast&quot;  of the United States, and was chosen by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of &quot;25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks&quot;.&lt;ref name =mustsee&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/index.htm | title = Find a Park: 25 Must-see Parks | accessdate = May 26, 2015 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded inhabitants of the area were the [[Susquehannock]]s, followed by the [[Seneca nation]], who hunted there. The first settlement within the park was a log [[tavern]] built in 1818&amp;nbsp;along a trail; the trail became a [[toll road|turnpike]] by 1834&amp;nbsp;and a hotel replaced the tavern in 1874, then burned in 1897. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the [[old-growth forest]]s were [[Clearcutting|clearcut]]; the state forest was established in 1901&amp;nbsp;and contains [[secondary forest|second growth woodlands]]. &quot;Cherry Springs Scenic Drive&quot; was established in 1922, and the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] built much of Cherry Springs State Park during the [[Great Depression]], including a picnic pavilion listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP). An annual &quot;Woodsmen's Show&quot; has been held in the park each August since 1952.

Cherry Springs State Park was named Pennsylvania's first [[Dark-sky preserve|dark sky park]] by the DCNR in 2000. The adjoining [[Cherry Springs Airport]], built in 1935, was closed and its land was added to the park in 2006, to expand its stargazing area. On June 11, 2007,&amp;nbsp;the [[International Dark-Sky Association]] named it the second &quot;International Dark Sky Park&quot;; under optimum conditions the [[Milky Way]] casts a discernible shadow. Cherry Springs has received national press coverage and hosts two [[star party|star parties]] a year, which attract hundreds of astronomers. There are regular stargazing and educational programs for the public at the park, and the Woodsmen's Show attracts thousands each summer. Cherry Springs also offers rustic camping, [[picnic]] facilities, and trails for [[mountain biking]], [[hiking]], and [[Snowmobile|snowmobiling]]. The surrounding state forest and park are home to a variety of flora and fauna.

==History==

===Native Americans===
Archeological evidence shows that humans have lived in what is now Pennsylvania since at least 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC.

Historical records show that the earliest known inhabitants of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]] [[drainage basin]], which includes Cherry Springs State Park, were the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Susquehannock]]s.

After the departure of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who lived in long houses, primarily in what is now [[upstate New York]], and had a strong [[confederation|confederacy]] which gave them power beyond their numbers.&lt;ref name = &quot;indians&quot;/&gt; The [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], members of the Iroquois Confederacy, hunted in the area of what is now Cherry Springs State Park.

The Seneca allowed very few travelers to pass through the area and kept non-native settlement to a minimum.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; The [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763) led to the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin, and more departed after the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783).&lt;ref name = &quot;indians&quot;/&gt; The United States acquired the Last Purchase, including what is now Cherry Springs State Park, from the Iroquois in the second [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)|Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] in October 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;path&quot;/&gt; In the years that followed, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;indians&quot;/&gt;

Large areas of forest were harvested by [[charcoal|colliers]] to fire [[bloomery|iron furnaces]]. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first [[Conestoga wagon]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;timber&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Tavern at Cherry Springs State Park.JPG|thumb|The [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] built this replica of the Cherry Springs Hotel, the tavern built by Jonathan Edgcomb in 1818.]]
The area surrounding Cherry Springs State Park has been a wilderness for much of its history. A [[bridle path]] was cut through the woods in 1806–1807, and was widened to accommodate wagons in 1812.&amp;nbsp;(Modern [[Pennsylvania Route 44]], which passes through the park, follows the course of this path between [[Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania|Jersey Shore]] and [[Coudersport, Pennsylvania|Coudersport]].) In 1818&amp;nbsp;the Ceres Land Company, which owned much of the land in Potter County and sought to open the area to settlement, hired an early settler, Jonathan Edgcomb, to build a [[tavern]] or hotel for travelers at the site of the park. The hotel was in a very remote location {{convert|16|mi}} south of Coudersport, and its visitors were few, occasional wandering travelers or Native Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;cssp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last= Morey|first= Tim|author2=Harrison, Maxine| year= 2002|title= Cherry Springs State Park: Hidden Resource in the Dark (part of the &quot;Emerald Gems&quot; series)|journal= Pennsylvania Recreation &amp; Parks|volume= 33|issue=  2|publisher= Pennsylvania Recreation and Park Society| location= [[State College, Pennsylvania]]|issn= 0742-793X|url= http://www.kwastronomy.com/History_of_Cherry_Springs_Park.htm|accessdate= October 14, 2008}} ''Note'': URL is to an authorized reprint of the article as &quot;History of Cherry Springs State Park&quot; on Kevin Wigell's Astronomy Page&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgcomb and his wife received {{convert|100|acre}} of land in exchange for building the hotel and running it for three years. When the contract expired in 1821, they sold their land and left the area, but the hotel and land that Edgcomb had cleared became known as &quot;Edgcomb's Clearing&quot;. The Jersey Shore and Coudersport [[Toll road|Turnpike]] was constructed along the wagon path between 1825&amp;nbsp;and 1834, and tolls were collected for travel on the road until 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; The park is in [[West Branch Township, Pennsylvania|West Branch Township]], which was incorporated from [[Eulalia Township, Pennsylvania|Eulalia Township]] in 1856.&lt;ref name = &quot;potter&quot;/&gt; A post office was opened at Edgcomb's Clearing in 1873; the locals petitioned the [[United States Post Office]] to change the name to &quot;Cherryville&quot;, for a nearby group of [[Prunus serotina|Black Cherry]] trees. However, since there was already a Cherryville, Pennsylvania, post office in [[Lehigh Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh Township]] in [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]], the name &quot;Cherry Spring&quot; was chosen as a compromise. In time an &quot;s&quot; was added, hence the name &quot;Cherry Springs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; There are also at least two [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] in the park.&lt;ref name = &quot;park map&quot;/&gt;

In 1874&amp;nbsp;a new, larger hotel was built on the other side of the road from the original tavern.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; It provided accommodations for wealthy summer visitors from Coudersport. This part of Potter County became known for an abundance of [[game (food)|game]] and fish, and attracted hunters and anglers who also stayed at the Cherry Springs Hotel. This era as a &quot;sportsmen's paradise&quot; was not to last, as the more profitable lumber industry came to West Branch and surrounding townships, which were home to &quot;some of the tallest, straightest timber left standing&quot; along the [[East Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

When lumbermen reached the Cherry Springs area in the late 1880s, eastern white pine and eastern hemlock covered the surrounding mountains. [[Lumberjack]]s harvested the trees and sent them down the creeks to the West Branch Susquehanna River to the [[Susquehanna Boom]] and [[sawmill]]s at [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]. [[Clearcutting]] allowed silt to choke the streams, and nothing was left except the dried-out tree tops, which became a fire hazard. As a result, large swaths of land burned and were left barren,&lt;ref name=&quot;cssp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;history&quot;/&gt; and much of the central part of the state became known as the &quot;Pennsylvania Desert&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;seasons doaf&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Owlett| first = Steven E.| title = Seasons Along The Tiadaghton: An Environmental History of the Pine Creek Gorge| year = 1993| chapter = The Death of a Forest| pages = 53–62| edition = 1st| publisher = Interprint| location = Petaluma, California| isbn = 0-9635905-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cherry Springs Hotel itself burned in 1897&amp;nbsp;and the property was abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

Like many state parks in north central Pennsylvania, development of the facilities at Cherry Springs was the work of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), a work relief program for young men from unemployed families. Established in 1933&amp;nbsp;as part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D.

In addition to the two CCC camps active at the park, Cherry Springs also was home to Camp Elliott, which was run by the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters (precursor to the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources|Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] (DCNR)) for college students and other unemployed men. In 1935&amp;nbsp;they built an [[Aerodrome|airfield]], [[Cherry Springs Airport|Cherry Springs Intermediate Field]], just north of the park. The {{convert|40|acre|adj=on}} airfield was originally built for emergency landings and later became a small airport.&lt;ref name = &quot;cssp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;history&quot;/&gt; In 1936&amp;nbsp;it had a [[sod]] [[runway]] of dimensions {{convert|2400|by|500|ft}}, and a hangar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Civil Aeronautics Bulletin| publisher = United States [[Civil Aeronautics Authority|Civil Aeronautics Administration]]| date = 1936| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_OO3AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Cherry+Spring+Airport&amp;q=%22Cherry+Springs%22| page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' entry into the [[World War II|Second World War]] led to the end of the CCC and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;npsccc&quot;/&gt;

In the post-war era, the park was long known chiefly for its isolated location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952&amp;nbsp;it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the [[Secondary forest|second growth forests]] in the area. The festival, originally sponsored by the Penn-York Lumbermen's Club, features lumberjack competitions as a reminder of the past, as well as displays of new equipment.&lt;ref name = &quot;history&quot;/&gt; In 1987&amp;nbsp;the Galeton [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]] took over sponsorship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://greenfreelibrary.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewer.aspx?img=14509737&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=5&amp;currentPage=10| title = Woodsman's Carnival set| date = May 27, 1987| page = 2| work = Wellsboro Gazette| accessdate = April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed the event the Woodsmen's Show in 1990.&lt;ref name = &quot;history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;1990 show&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://greenfreelibrary.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewer.aspx?img=18601372&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=2&amp;currentPage=0| title = Woodsmen's show set in Galeton| date = July 25, 1990| page = 8| work = Wellsboro Gazette| accessdate = April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the CCC and its work in the park were honored. Cherry Springs State Park was one of several to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Civilian Conservation Corps with a CCC reunion in the summer of 1983.&lt;ref name = &quot;cupper&quot;/&gt; On May 11, 1987, the Cherry Springs Picnic Pavilion was listed on the NRHP.&lt;ref name=&quot;milner&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- NRHP Ref Number 87000052 --&gt; None of the other remaining CCC structures in the park had retained its historic integrity sufficiently to be included on the NRHP.&lt;ref name = &quot;ECW&quot;/&gt;

===Dark skies===
[[File:M20-Combine1B.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Trifid Nebula]] (M20) in Sagittarius, as seen from the park ]]Astronomers and stargazers appreciate Cherry Springs State Park for the darkness and clarity of its skies, which make it &quot;perhaps the last best refuge of the natural night sky&quot; in the eastern half of the United States.&lt;ref name = &quot;darksky&quot;/&gt; The sky at Cherry Springs has been classified as a 2&amp;nbsp;on the [[Bortle Dark-Sky Scale]], meaning it has almost no [[light pollution]].&lt;ref name = &quot;bortle&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/info/wind/documents/cherry-springs-state-park-light-pollution-analysis-05-29-08.pdf| title = Cherry Springs State Park: Light Pollution Analysis and Recommendations| publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources| date = May 27, 2008| author = Clanton &amp; Associates| accessdate = March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such &quot;truly dark, starry skies are unavailable to two-thirds of the world's population, including 99&amp;nbsp;percent of people in the continental U.S. and Western Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;fermata&quot;/&gt; With optimum conditions, 10,000&amp;nbsp;stars are visible with the [[naked eye]] at the park, clouds appear only as black holes in the starry sky, and the [[Milky Way]] is so bright that it casts a discernible shadow.&lt;ref name = &quot;bortle&quot;/&gt; In contrast, big city residents can see a few dozen stars at best, and even those in rural areas can typically only see 2,000–3,000&amp;nbsp;stars. The Milky Way cannot be seen by most in the eastern US, even when there is no moonlight to obscure it.&lt;ref name = &quot;fermata&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The quality of the night skies at the park and its growing popularity for stargazing are the result of several factors. Cherry Springs is in the midst of the largely undeveloped {{convert|262000|acre|adj=on}} Susquehannock State Forest, and is on a summit {{convert|2300|ft|0}} above sea level. Because it is on the Allegheny Plateau, there are no mountain peaks to block the sky, and the Astronomy Field offers a 360&amp;nbsp;degree unobstructed view. The closest city is Williamsport, {{convert|60|mi}} to the southeast. Surrounding communities sit in deep valleys, so the intervening terrain screens much of the light they produce; the park has no artificial [[skyglow]] in any direction. Cherry Springs is generally fog-free and its latitude puts it in excellent position to observe the [[Galactic Center]] of the Milky Way. The remote location also means there is little commercial air traffic to interfere with [[astrophotography]], while PA Route 44 still offers relatively easy access to the park from [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]].&lt;ref name = &quot;history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;dark skies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt;

In addition to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on [[night vision]] and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen [[berm]]s covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid for many of these improvements since 1999.&lt;ref name = &quot;history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;dark skies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;awesome&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = 'Awesome': Stargazers revel in Cherry Springs’ dark skies| last = Lamey| first = Jessica| date = June 29, 2008| pages = E1, E3| work = [[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]]| url = http://www.sungazette.com/page/content.detail/id/512360.html?nav=5013| accessdate = March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2006&amp;nbsp;acquisition of the Cherry Springs airport, a new Public Programming field has been established on the former airstrip. This field is northeast of PA Route 44 and is intended for educational programs or stargazing, but not for those who spend the night. Overnight observers and those with large telescopes use the Astronomy Field southwest of the highway. Nighttime visitors may only use flashlights with red filters, and may only point them at the ground. The Astronomy Field has further restrictions on lights, and parts of the park are light-free zones.&lt;ref name = &quot;dark skies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;awesome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;sky and telescope&quot;/&gt;

To help preserve the dark skies at Cherry Springs State Park, Tri-County Rural Electric company installs light-shielding caps on outdoor lights at local homes for free.&lt;ref name = &quot;history&quot;/&gt; In 2001&amp;nbsp;the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed the &quot;Outdoor Lighting Control Act&quot;, which both established the park as a &quot;Dark Sky Preserve&quot; and required minimal and shielded lighting at all new state facilities to reduce light pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2001&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=0300&amp;pn=2860| title = An Act Providing for management of outdoor night lighting (House Bill No. 300, Session of 2001)| publisher = The General Assembly of Pennsylvania| date = November 13, 2001| accessdate = March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A design guide for the Pennsylvania Wilds region, which includes the park, emphasizes the importance of maintaining dark skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.clintoncountypa.com/PA%20Wilds/PA%20Wilds%20Guide/PA%20Wilds%20Design%20Guide2.pdf| title = Pennsylvania Wilds Design Guide&quot; A Design Guide for Community Character Stewardship| author = The Pennsylvania Wilds Planning Team| publisher = [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania]]| date = February 13, 2009| accessdate = March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DCNR spent $396,000 in June 2007 to buy [[mineral rights]] under {{convert|1980|acre}} of the park and state forest to prevent [[natural gas]] drilling and associated development there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09123/967360-113.stm| title = Goddard State Park's gas wells may be first of hundreds: Where mineral rights are privately owned, Pennsylvania officials can't prevent drilling| date = May 3, 2009| first = Don| last = Hopey| work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| accessdate = May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[wind farm]] has been proposed on a site {{convert|13.7|mi}} from the park. In 2008&amp;nbsp;Potter County passed an ordinance that [[wind turbine]] lights shall not &quot;interfere with the state-designated Dark Skies Preserve at Cherry Springs State Park&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pottercountypa.net/planning/saldo/Article12.doc| title = Potter County Wind Energy Ordinance| date = 2008| publisher = [[Potter County, Pennsylvania]]| accessdate = March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the DCNR commissioned a study on the wind farm's impact, which concluded the red warning lights on the wind turbines would not impact the darkness of the sky and would only be directly visible from the Astronomy Field under rare conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bortle&quot;/&gt; Others in the astronomy community challenged these conclusions and feared that new lights on &quot;several dozen wind turbines near the park&quot; will degrade observations and astrophotography.&lt;ref name = &quot;sky and telescope&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/21914474.html| title = Cherry Springs Earns Dark-Sky Status| author = Beatty, Kelly| work = [[Sky and Telescope]]| date = June 27, 2008| accessdate = March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also recommended that the DCNR shield and redirect lights at the nearby [[Denton Hill State Park]] downhill ski area to make the sky even darker at Cherry Springs.&lt;ref name = &quot;bortle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = State: Proposed wind farm would not affect dark skies at Cherry Springs State Park| date = June 29, 2008| page = E3| work = [[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]]| url =http://www.sungazette.com/page/content.detail/id/512363.html| accessdate = March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomical observing===
[[File:Cherry Springs telescopes.jpg|thumb|Telescopes belonging to amateur astronomers await nightfall]]
The staff at Cherry Springs State Park did not intend for it to become an attraction for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997&amp;nbsp;or 1998&amp;nbsp;Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a telescope at the park at about 1&amp;nbsp;AM.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/travel/escapes/14dark.html| title = Dark Sky, Bright Lights Over Pennsylvania| first = Dave| last = Caldwell| date = September 14, 2007| accessdate = February 1, 2009| work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;pittsburgh&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Pennsylvania peak is heaven for stargazers| last = Nephin| first = Dan| date = September 15, 2006| url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06258/721452-37.stm| agency= [[Associated Press]] |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate = March 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Harrison asked why the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, one of the best locations east of the [[Mississippi River]] for [[Amateur astronomy|stargazing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt;

An increasing number of astronomers began to come to Cherry Springs, most in the 14-day dark sky period around the [[new moon]], between the last quarter and first quarter phases. The park is open year-round and between 60&amp;nbsp;and 85&amp;nbsp;nights each year have ideal conditions,&lt;ref name = &quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; when the [[apparent magnitude]]s of the faintest stars visible can range from 7.1&amp;nbsp;to 7.5.&lt;ref name = &quot;bortle&quot;/&gt; The park's Astronomy Field has been upgraded to accommodate these astronomers. In 2005&amp;nbsp;a rotating {{convert|15|ft|adj=on}} slotted observatory dome, two {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} clamshell domes, and a {{convert|10|by|12|ft|adj=on}} sky shed were added, as well as a small amphitheater for programs. The four structures protect telescopes from the wind and thermal currents. The next year concrete pads {{convert|4|and|6|ft|}} in diameter were placed at random in the field, and electrical pedestals, each with six outlets, were added to power telescopes and computers.&lt;ref name = &quot;dark skies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;progress&quot;/&gt; In 2009, [[Wi-Fi]] internet access was added to the Astronomy Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.astrohbg.org/CSSP/Information.html| title = 2009 Cherry Springs Star Party| publisher = The Astronomical Society of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania| accessdate = May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodsmen's Show===
[[File:Phot cherryshow2.jpg|thumb|A chainsaw event at the Woodsmen's Show]]
The Woodsmen's Show attracts thousands of visitors to Cherry Springs State Park on the first weekend in August. It has been held every year since 1952, and has been sponsored by the [[Galeton, Pennsylvania|Galeton]] Rotary Club since 1987. In 2008&amp;nbsp;events at the three-day show included tree-felling, cross-cutting, [[logrolling (sport)|log rolling]], axe-throwing, [[horse pulling]], spring board chopping, the standing block chop, and [[chainsaw]] competitions and demonstrations.

===Camping, picnicking, and trails===
[[File:Cherry Springs State Park Camping Area 2.jpg|thumb|right|The camping area at the park, with picnic tables]]
The park has 30&amp;nbsp;camping sites which can each accommodate a tent, or a [[recreational vehicle]] (RV) up to {{convert|30|ft}} long. The sites all have a fire ring, lantern hanger, and picnic table, and are classified as rustic because they have no running water. The camping area, which is southeast of Pennsylvania Route 44, is open from April to December and does not accept reservations. The park has two modern latrines, one in the camping area and the other at the Astronomy Field. There is also a [[holding tank dump station]] for RVs.&lt;ref name=&quot;cssp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;park map&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;moon&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=-5EWcHhCUSwC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=cherry+Springs+Camping+moon| title = Pennsylvania Camping: The Complete Guide to Tent and RV Camping| series = Moon Outdoors| last = Miller| first = Jason| first2 = Heidi Ruby|last2=Miller| others = Miller, Jason Jack (photographer)| publisher = Avalon Travel Publishing| date = 2006| isbn = 978-1-56691-986-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/cherrysprings/index.htm | title = Cherry Springs State Park | accessdate = November 12, 2014| publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Astronomy Field is not an official camping area, overnight observers may set up tents and vehicles there in which to camp.&lt;ref name = &quot;dark skies&quot;/&gt; In addition to the picnic tables and small pavilion in the camping area, the main picnic area at Cherry Springs is on the southwest side of Route 44, in and around the large historic, CCC-built pavilion.
