'''''Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution''''' is a book written by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]] first published in 1976. It proposed a solution to five murders in Victorian [[London]] that were blamed on an unidentified [[serial killer]] known as &quot;[[Jack the Ripper]]&quot;.

Knight presented an elaborate [[conspiracy theory]] involving the [[British royal family]], [[freemasonry]] and the painter [[Walter Sickert]]. He concluded that the victims were murdered to cover up a secret marriage between the second-in-line to the throne, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]], and Annie Elizabeth Crook, a working class girl. There are many facts that contradict Knight's theory, and his main source, Joseph Gorman (also known as Joseph Sickert), later retracted the story and admitted to the press that it was a hoax. Most scholars dismiss the theory and the book's conclusion is now widely discredited.

Nevertheless, the book was popular and commercially successful, going through 20 editions.&lt;ref&gt;Knight's literary agent, Andrew Hewson, quoted in Rice, Karen (16 December 2001) &quot;Jack the Ripper 'revlations'{{sic}} exposed as same old story.&quot; ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It was the basis for the graphic novel and [[From Hell (film)|film]] ''[[From Hell]]'', as well as other dramatisations, and has influenced crime fiction writers, such as [[Patricia Cornwell]] and [[Anne Perry]].

==Origins==
Between August and November 1888, at least five brutal murders were committed in the [[Whitechapel]] district of London. Although Whitechapel was an impoverished area and violence there was common, these murders can be linked to the same killer through a distinctive ''[[modus operandi]]''. All the murders took place within the distance of a few streets, late at night or in the early morning, and the victims were all women whose throats were cut. In four of the cases, their bodies were mutilated, or even [[Disembowelment|eviscerated]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans and Skinner, pp. 399–402 and Knight, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of internal organs from three of the victims led to contemporary proposals that &quot;considerable anatomical knowledge was displayed by the murderer, which would seem to indicate that his occupation was that of a butcher or a surgeon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Winslow, the examining pathologist, quoted in Haggard, Robert F. (1993). [http://www.essaysinhistory.com/articles/2012/90 &quot;Jack the Ripper As the Threat of Outcast London&quot;]. ''Essays in History''. Volume 35. Corcoran Department of History at the [[University of Virginia]]. Accessed 17&amp;nbsp;July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Media organisations and the police received many letters and postcards purportedly written by the killer, who was dubbed &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; after one of the signatories. Most of the anonymous confessional letters were dismissed by the police as hoaxes but one, known as the [[From Hell letter|&quot;From Hell&quot; letter]] after a phrase used by the writer, was treated more seriously; it was sent with a small box containing half of a preserved human kidney. It is not clear, however, whether the kidney truly came from one of the victims or was a medical specimen sent as part of a macabre joke.&lt;ref&gt;DiGrazia, Christopher-Michael (March 2000). [http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-cmdlusk.html &quot;Another Look at the Lusk Kidney&quot;]. ''Ripper Notes''. Published online by [[Casebook: Jack the Ripper]]. Accessed 17&amp;nbsp;July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Gunter (2008). [http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfn198 &quot;A kidney from hell? A nephrological view of the Whitechapel murders in 1888&quot;]. ''Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation'' vol. 23 pp. 3343–3349 (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 222; Marriott, pp. 166, 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite an extensive police investigation, the killer was never found and his identity is still a mystery. Both at the time and subsequently, many amateur and professional investigators have proposed solutions but no single theory is widely accepted.

===Claims of Thomas Stowell===
In 1970, British surgeon [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] published an article entitled &quot;Jack the Ripper&amp;nbsp;– A Solution?&quot; in the November issue of ''[[The Criminologist (crime journal)|The Criminologist]]''. In the article, Stowell proposed that the Ripper was an aristocrat who had contracted [[syphilis]] during a visit to the [[West Indies]], that it had driven him insane, and that in this state of mind he had perpetrated the five canonical Jack the Ripper murders.&lt;ref name=Stowell/&gt; Although Stowell did not directly name his suspect in the article, he described in detail the suspect's family and his physical appearance and nicknames, all of which pointed to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] grandson, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]].&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, pp. 209–213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Stowell wrote that following a double murder on 30&amp;nbsp;September 1888, his suspect was restrained by his own family in an institution in the south of England, but later escaped to commit a final murder on 9&amp;nbsp;November before ultimately dying of syphilis. To back up his theory, Stowell drew comparisons between the evisceration of the women and the disembowelment of deer shot by the aristocracy on their estates.&lt;ref name=Stowell/&gt; Stowell said his information came from the private notes of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], a reputable physician who had treated members of the royal family.&lt;ref name=Stowell&gt;Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) &quot;Jack the Ripper&amp;nbsp;– A Solution?&quot;. ''The Criminologist'' vol. 5 pp. 40–51 quoted in Rumbelow, pp. 209–212&lt;/ref&gt; Stowell knew Gull's son-in-law, [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], and was an executor of Acland's estate.&lt;ref&gt;Begg, pp. 288–289 and Knight, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Albert Victor late 1880s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]], c. 1888]]
[[File:William gull.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was a notable physician who retired through ill health in 1887.]]

Stowell's article attracted intense attention,&lt;ref name=Time&gt;See for example: &quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943254,00.html Who Was Jack the Ripper?]&quot; (9 November 1970). ''Time Magazine''. Accessed 17 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; and placed Albert Victor among the most notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so could not have known about Albert Victor's death.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of [[pneumonia]], and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression, it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he would probably have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, pp. 211–212 and Trow, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.&lt;ref name=marriott&gt;Marriott, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, on 30&amp;nbsp;September 1888, when [[Elizabeth Stride]] and [[Catherine Eddowes]] were killed in the early morning, Albert Victor was at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]], the royal retreat in Scotland, over 500&amp;nbsp;miles (over 800&amp;nbsp;km) from London.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5&amp;nbsp;November 1970, Stowell wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' denying that it was his intention to imply Prince Albert Victor was Jack the Ripper. The letter was published on 9&amp;nbsp;November,&lt;ref&gt;Stowell, T. E. A. (9&amp;nbsp;November 1970). &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;. ''[[The Times]]'' p. 9; Issue 58018; col. F&lt;/ref&gt; the day after the elderly Stowell's own death from natural causes. The same week, Stowell's son reported that he had burned his father's papers, saying &quot;I read just sufficient to make certain that there was nothing of importance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;PHS (14&amp;nbsp;November 1970). &quot;The Times Diary: Ripper file destroyed&quot;. ''The Times'' p. 12; Issue 58023; col. E&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of Joseph Gorman===
Though Stowell's hypothesis was incorrect, his article rekindled interest in the Jack the Ripper case,&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 the [[BBC]] launched a television series, ''Jack the Ripper'', which investigated the [[Whitechapel murders]]. The series mixed documentary and drama; it featured real evidence but was hosted by [[Z-Cars|fictional detectives Barlow and Watt]], played by [[Stratford Johns]] and [[Frank Windsor]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 16 and Rumbelow, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The series was made into a book, ''The Ripper File'', by [[Elwyn Jones (writer)|Elwyn Jones]] and [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] in 1975. The sixth and final programme included a testimony by Joseph Gorman, who called himself Joseph Sickert and claimed to be the illegitimate son of noted painter [[Walter Sickert]]. Gorman claimed that Sickert had told him a story that implicated not only the royal family but also a host of other famous people in the murders.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gorman, Gull committed the murders with the help of accomplices. Stowell had mentioned rumours implicating Gull in his article, but had dismissed them as unfair and false.&lt;ref&gt;Begg, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorman said that his [[Catholic]] grandmother had secretly married Albert Victor, and that his mother, as the legitimate daughter of Albert Victor, was the rightful heir to the throne. He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged as part of a conspiracy to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight, pp. 24–39&quot;&gt;Knight, pp. 24–39&lt;/ref&gt; In the original television series, the story is depicted as the belief of Gorman but not of the detectives. Captivated by Gorman's story, journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further,&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually published his research as the book ''Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution'' in 1976.

==Content==

===Gorman's story===
[[File:Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] was Prime Minister at the time of the murders.]]

The book begins with Knight explaining how he came to meet Joseph Gorman, and then he tells Gorman's story which &quot;did not come in clear, precise, chronological order but I had to glean it from rambling and sometimes vague discussion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Gorman says that Albert Victor's mother, Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], introduced Walter Sickert to her son in the hope that Sickert would teach Albert Victor about art. Gorman claims that Albert Victor met one of Sickert's models, Annie Elizabeth Crook, a Catholic shop girl, at Sickert's studio at 15 [[Cleveland Street, London]]. They had an affair, he says, and married in a secret ceremony with Sickert and Annie's friend, [[Mary Jane Kelly]], acting as witnesses. Gorman alleges that Albert Victor and Annie's daughter, Alice Margaret Crook, was born on 18&amp;nbsp;April 1885, and that Albert Victor settled Annie and Alice into an apartment in Cleveland Street. In April 1888, Gorman continues, Queen Victoria and the British Prime Minister [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] discovered Albert Victor's secret. Gorman accuses Salisbury of ordering a raid on the apartment because he was afraid that public knowledge of a potential Catholic heir to the throne would result in a revolution. Gorman claims that Albert Victor was placed in the custody of his family, while Annie was placed in the custody of Sir William Gull, who certified her insane; she spent the next 30 years drifting in and out of institutions before dying in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 22–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Gorman alleges, Kelly was looking after the daughter, Alice, both during and after the raid. Gorman asserts that at first Kelly was content to hide the child, but then she, along with her friends [[Mary Ann Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman]] and [[Elizabeth Stride]], decided to [[blackmail]] the government. Gorman accuses Salisbury of conspiring with his fellow freemasons, including senior policemen in the [[London Metropolitan Police]], to stop the scandal by staging the murders of the women. Gorman says Salisbury assigned the task to Gull, who lured the four women into a carriage individually where Gull murdered them with the assistance of coachman [[John Netley]] and [[Sir Robert Anderson]], Assistant Commissioner of [[Scotland Yard]]. Gorman claims a fifth victim, [[Catherine Eddowes]], was killed accidentally in a case of mistaken identity because she used the alias Mary Ann Kelly and was confused with Mary Jane Kelly. Gorman alleges that Netley tried to kill the young Alice twice but after the second unsuccessful attempt several witnesses chased Netley, who threw himself into the [[Thames]] and drowned. Gorman completes the story by saying that Alice lived well into old age, later becoming Walter Sickert's mistress, and that Alice and Walter Sickert are his parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight, pp. 24–39&quot;/&gt;

===Knight's investigation===
Knight explains that at first he did not believe Gorman's sensational story, which seemed &quot;arrant, if entertaining, nonsense&quot;, but was so entranced by it that he had to investigate further.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 30 and 40&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the progress of his investigation, Knight reveals a series of coincidences: both Albert Victor's mother and Alice Crook were deaf;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; both Albert Victor's mother and Walter Sickert were Danish;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Sickert is obsessed by the Ripper;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; the murders ended with the death of Mary Kelly;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; there was growing republican sentiment at the time of the murders,&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 80–85&lt;/ref&gt; as well as anti-Catholic prejudice;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 90–92&lt;/ref&gt; a woman named &quot;Elizabeth Cook&quot;, who Knight claims could be Annie Elizabeth Crook misspelt, did live at 6 Cleveland Street;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Annie Crook was institutionalised;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; rumours of the time link Prince Albert Victor to a [[Cleveland Street scandal|scandal in Cleveland Street]];&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Gull was fond of grapes, and one of the victims may have been eating some at the time of her death;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 240–245&lt;/ref&gt; Gull matches the description of an unnamed physician accused by clairvoyant [[Robert James Lees]], who claimed to have identified the Ripper by using psychic powers.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 193–203&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes convinced that Gorman's story is true.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of tangible evidence, he claims, is due to a government cover-up and deliberate misdirection of the police investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 106–141&lt;/ref&gt; To back up the claims of a [[Masonic conspiracy theories|masonic conspiracy]], he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged [[Masonic ritual and symbolism|masonic ritual]] murders,&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 151–177&lt;/ref&gt; and accuses Sir [[Charles Warren]], [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of Police]], of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;When graffiti mentioning &quot;Juwes&quot; was found near the site of one of the murders, Warren ordered it washed away before it could be photographed. He later said he feared [[anti-Semitic]] riots if the words were reported. Knight claims that &quot;Juwes&quot; is not a misspelling of &quot;Jews&quot; but is a reference to &quot;three apprentice Masons&amp;nbsp;... who are the basis of Masonic ritual&quot; (Knight, p. 179).&lt;/ref&gt; Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders,&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 205–207&lt;/ref&gt; was a freemason.&lt;ref&gt;Stowell's will quoted in Knight, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Reviewers at the time of first publication met the book with undisguised scepticism and satire, but felt that Knight presented his unlikely case with ingenuity. [[Quentin Bell]] wrote in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'': &quot;[The book] begins bravely and fairly by presenting the greater part of the author's case and admitting at once that 'it all sounds terribly unlikely'. It does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quentin Bell|Bell, Quentin]] (30 July 1976). &quot;A right royal cover-up&quot;. ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''. p. 953&lt;/ref&gt; ''Medical History'' stated: &quot;Despite the author's ingenuity the case does not stand up to careful and critical analysis and is no more 'final' than its many predecessors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (1977). ''Medical History''. vol. 21 p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, scholars from multiple disciplines have rejected Gorman's story as a ridiculous fantasy, and highlight many facts which contradict the version of events presented by Knight.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. M. S. (2006). &quot;Sir William Withey Gull (1816–1890)&quot;. ''European Neurology'' vol. 55 pp. 53–56 (Subscription required) {{doi|10.1159/000091430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 110; Begg, pp. x–xi; Cook, p. 9; Cornwell, pp. 133–135; Fido, pp. 185–196; Harrison, pp. 142–143; Hyde, p. 58; Knight, p. 180; Marriott, pp. 267–268; Meikle, pp. 146–147, 178, 188; Ridley, pp. 266–267; Roland, pp. 142–147; Rumbelow, pp. 209–244 and Trow, pp. 152–158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whiteway/&gt;

Annie Crook was a real person and did have a daughter, Alice, born on 18&amp;nbsp;April 1885 at St Marylebone Workhouse, and Joseph Gorman was Alice's son. However, there is no evidence in support of Gorman's claim that his father was Walter Sickert.&lt;ref name=baron&gt;Baron, Wendy (September 2004). [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36083 &quot;Sickert, Walter Richard (1860–1942)&quot;]. ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Accessed 17&amp;nbsp;July 2009. (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Gorman was one of five children born within the marriage of Alice Margaret Crook and William Gorman.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Christopher (2004). [http://www.casebook.org/ripper_media/book_reviews/non-fiction/castofthousands.crook.html &quot;Jack the Ripper: A Cast of Thousands&quot;]. ''Casebook: Jack the Ripper''. Accessed 17&amp;nbsp;July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Trevor Marriott, an expert on the Jack the Ripper case, Alice &quot;must have been conceived between 18&amp;nbsp;July and 11&amp;nbsp;August 1884&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marriott, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Victor was in [[Heidelberg]] from June to August 1884; hence, he was not in London at the time of Alice's conception and could not have been her father.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 88 and Marriott, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Alice's father was left blank on her birth certificate,&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office, England and Wales (April–June 1885). Civil Registration Indexes: Births. Marylebone vol. 1a, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; but in adulthood, Alice claimed her father was William Crook.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, pp. 228, 231&lt;/ref&gt; William Crook was also the name of her grandfather. Ripper expert [[Don Rumbelow]] has suggested that the name of Alice's father was omitted from her birth certificate either because she was illegitimate or to conceal an incestuous relationship between her mother, Annie, and grandfather, William.&lt;ref name=rum&gt;Rumbelow, pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of any marriage between Albert Victor and Annie Crook;&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 88 and Knight, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; even if such a marriage had taken place, it would have been invalid under British law due to the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], which voids any marriage contracted by a member of the royal family without the consent of the Sovereign. Any child of an invalid marriage is deemed illegitimate and excluded from the [[line of succession]].&lt;ref name=rumbelow232and233/&gt; Gorman claimed that his grandmother was Catholic, although records prove this to be untrue.&lt;ref name=rumbelow232and233&gt;Begg, p. 293; Rumbelow, pp. 232–233; Wilson and Odell, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; If she had been and if she had married Albert Victor, he and their child would be excluded from inheriting the throne under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excludes Catholics from the line of succession.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

There are further multiple problems with Gorman's version of events. An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street could not have been raided in April 1888, since by that time Nos. 4–14 Cleveland Street had been demolished, and the house no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;Begg, p. 293; Rumbelow, p. 232; Wilson and Odell, pp. 209–210&lt;/ref&gt; Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron, such as Albert Victor,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; but were paupers who occasionally lived in [[workhouse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, pp. 241–242&lt;/ref&gt; Annie was not institutionalised for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, pp. 226, 229–231&lt;/ref&gt; The Ripper victims were not known to be acquainted with each other or Annie Crook, who lived on the other side of Central London.&lt;ref&gt;Begg, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Even if they had known her or her child, it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed, so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke, which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Rumbelow, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Gull did recover, but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 180–182, 201&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, neither Lord Salisbury,&lt;ref&gt;''Freemason'', 29&amp;nbsp;August 1903, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; nor Sir James Anderson, nor Sir William Gull were freemasons,&lt;ref&gt;Peabody, David (July 2002) [http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-2/p-48.php &quot;Exploding the Ripper Masonic link&quot;]. ''MQ Magazine'' issue 2, p. 48. Accessed 11 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects, nor did he drown in the Thames.&lt;ref name=p216&gt;Knight, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The [[forensic evidence]] indicates that the bodies of the victims were not moved, and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Fido, p. 195; Marriott, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage.&lt;ref name=marriott/&gt; Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street,&lt;ref&gt;Begg, p. 293 and Rumbelow, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no proof that he knew the Princess of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 292 and Knight, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson was in [[Switzerland]] at the time of the double murder, and so was not one of the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 247 and [[Nigel Cawthorne|Cawthorne, Nigel]] (2000) &quot;Afterword&quot; in: Knight, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Walter Sickert 1884.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Walter Sickert]], c. 1884]]

Knight appreciated that there were problems with Gorman's claims, but he &quot;either misinterpreted, or deliberately ignored&quot; them.&lt;ref name=whiteway&gt;Whiteway, Ken (2004). &quot;A Guide to the Literature of Jack the Ripper&quot;. ''Canadian Law Library Review'' vol. 29 pp. 219–229&lt;/ref&gt; Knight admitted that parts of Gorman's story were wrong but claimed that such mistakes were &quot;stronger support of the fact that he was telling the truth&quot;.&lt;ref name=p216/&gt; Realising that Anderson's absence in Switzerland meant that Anderson could not have been an accomplice, Knight considered Walter Sickert a much more likely culprit than Anderson, and suggested that he was the &quot;third man&quot; to participate in the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 246–262&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the first accusation made against Sickert. He had been previously mentioned as a potential suspect in [[Donald McCormick]]'s 1959 book ''The Identity of Jack the Ripper''.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sickert was in France with his mother and brother in the late summer of 1888, and is unlikely even to have been in London at the time of at least four of the murders.&lt;ref name=sturgis&gt;Sturgis, Matthew (3&amp;nbsp;November 2002). &quot;Making a killing from the Ripper&quot;. ''[[The Sunday Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; After Knight implicated Sickert, Joseph Gorman withdrew his testimony, admitting to ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' newspaper that &quot;it was a hoax&amp;nbsp;... a whopping fib&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunday Times'', 18&amp;nbsp;June 1978, quoted in Fido, p. 195 and Rumbelow, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight's friend and fellow Ripper aficionado [[Colin Wilson]] thought the story was &quot;obvious nonsense&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Odell, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; but shortly after Knight's tragically early death from a brain tumour he wrote in his defence: &quot;he wrote the book with his tongue in his cheek, then found himself caught up in a success that prevented him from retracting or quietly disowning it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson and Odell, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Despite its many inconsistencies, Knight's and Gorman's conspiracy theory has captured the imagination of other authors, who have made further modifications to the story. For example, Melvyn Fairclough's ''The Ripper and the Royals'' (London: Duckworth, 1991) asserted that [[Lord Randolph Churchill]] was the &quot;third man&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Begg, p. 292 and Trow, pp. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; although Fairclough later disowned his own book and told reporters that &quot;he no longer believes the theory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edge, Simon (15 December 2001). &quot;'My grandfather was the heir to the throne and Jack the Ripper killed to cover it up'&quot;. ''[[Daily Express]]&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Parlour, Sue Parlour and Kevin O'Donnell, authors of ''The Jack the Ripper Whitechapel Murders'' (St. Osyth, Essex: Ten Bells Publishing, 1997), supposed that [[Mary Jane Kelly]] was pregnant with Albert Victor's child instead of Annie Crook. These, and other books which promote Sickert from a knowing accomplice to being Jack the Ripper himself, such as [[Jean Overton-Fuller]]'s ''Sickert and the Ripper Crimes'' (Oxford: Mandrake, 1990) and [[Patricia Cornwell]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Killer]]'' (2002), are marketed as non-fiction books, but they are dismissed almost universally as derivative fantasies based on Knight's initial flawed analysis.&lt;ref name=whiteway/&gt;&lt;ref name=baron/&gt;&lt;ref name=sturgis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Begg, pp. x–xi, 295–296; Meikle, p. 197; Roland, pp. 132–137 and Rumbelow, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

The conspiracy theory outlined in ''Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution'' is fictionalised in the play ''Force and Hypocrisy'' by Doug Lucie. Four films have used elements of the theory: ''[[Murder by Decree]]'', ''[[Jack the Ripper (1988 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'', ''[[The Ripper (film)|The Ripper]]'', and the [[Hughes Brothers]]' ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'', which was based on a [[graphic novel]] of [[From Hell|the same name]] by [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Eddie Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;Meikle, pp. 224–234&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight's theory features in the final book of [[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Riverworld]] series, ''[[Gods of Riverworld]]'', and novels utilising Knight's book as a base include [[Robin Paige]]'s ''Death at Whitechapel'' (New York: Berkley Publishing Group, 2000) and [[Anne Perry]]'s ''The Whitechapel Conspiracy'' (London: Headline, 2001).&lt;ref name=whiteway/&gt;
