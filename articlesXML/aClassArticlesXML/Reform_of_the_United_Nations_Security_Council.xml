[[File:United Nations Security Council.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[United Nations Security Council]] Chamber in New York, also known as the ''Norwegian Room'']]

'''Reform of the [[United Nations Security Council]]''' ('''UNSC''') encompasses five key issues: categories of membership, the question of [[United Nations Security Council veto power|the veto]] held by the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council and its working methods, and the Security Council-General Assembly relationship. Member States, regional groups and other Member State interest groupings developed different positions and proposals on how to move forward on this contested issue.&lt;ref&gt;Also see [http://www.reformtheun.org/index.php?module=uploads&amp;func=download&amp;fileId=4097 letter from the Chairman], Zahir Tanin, of the intergovernmental negotiations on the question of equitable representation and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council&lt;/ref&gt;

Any reform of the Security Council would require the agreement of at least two-thirds of UN member states, and that of all the permanent members of the UNSC enjoying the veto right.

==History==
The composition of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] was established in 1945. Since then the geopolitical realities have changed drastically, but the Council has changed very little. The victors of [[World War II]] shaped the [[United Nations Charter]] in their national interests, dividing the permanent seats, and associated veto power, among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/security-council/security-council-reform.html &quot;Security Council Reform&quot;]. Global Policy Forum. Retrieved 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Any reform of the Security Council would require an amendment to the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sc/about/faq.shtml#reform|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the United Nations Security Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 108 of the Charter states:

{{Quote|Amendments to the present Charter shall come into force for all Members of the United Nations when they have been adopted by a vote of two thirds of the members of the General Assembly and ratified in accordance with their respective constitutional processes by two thirds of the Members of the United Nations, including all the permanent members of the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter18.shtml#article108 UNSC Article 108]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the [[enlargement of the United Nations]] membership and increasing self-confidence among the new members, going hand in hand with processes of [[decolonization]], old structures and procedures were increasingly challenged. The imbalance between the number of seats in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and the total number of member States became evident, and the only significant reform of the Security Council occurred in 1965:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/2046(XX)&amp;Lang=E&amp;Area=RESOLUTION |title=English General Assembly Resolutions Resolutions of previous sessions 1965 |publisher=United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt; this included an increase in the non-permanent membership from six to 10 members.&lt;ref name=weiss&gt;Weiss, Thomas G. [http://www.ony.unu.edu/The%20Illusion%20of%20UN%20Security%20Council%20Reform.pdf The Illusion of UN Security Council Reform], Washington Quarterly, Autumn 2003&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] elected as [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] in 1992, the reform discussions of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] were launched again as he started his new term with the first-ever summit of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and then published &quot;An Agenda for Peace&quot;. His motivation was to restructure the composition and arguably anachronistic procedures of the UN organ to recognize the changed world.&lt;ref name=weiss/&gt;

By 1992, Japan and Germany had become the second and third largest financial contributors to the United Nations, and started to demand a permanent seat. Also [[Brazil]] (fifth largest country in terms of territory) and [[India]] (second largest country in terms of population) as the most powerful countries within their regional groups and key players within their regions saw themselves with a permanent seat. This group of four countries formed an interest group later known as the [[G4 nations|G4]].

On the other hand, their regional rivals were opposed to the G4 becoming permanent members with a veto power. They favored the expansion of the non-permanent category of seats with members to be elected on a regional basis. Italy, Pakistan, Mexico and Egypt started to form an interest group, known as the &quot;[[Coffee Club]]&quot; and later &quot;[[Uniting for Consensus]]&quot;.

Simultaneously, the [[United Nations Regional Groups#African Group|African Group]] started to demand two permanent seats for themselves, on the basis of historical injustices and because much of the Council's agenda is concentrated in that continent. Those two seats would be permanent African seats, that would rotate between African countries chosen by the African group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforunreform.org/system/files/Managing+Change+-+1.+Reform+of+the+Security+Council.pdf Microsoft Word – FINAL C.rtf]. (PDF). Retrieved 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existing permanent members, each holding the right of veto on [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] reform, announced their positions reluctantly. The United States supported the permanent membership of Japan and India, and a small number of additional non-permanent members. The United Kingdom and France essentially supported the G4 position, with the expansion of permanent and non-permanent members and the accession of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan to permanent member status, as well as more African countries on the Council. China supported the stronger representation of [[Developing country|developing countries]], voicing support for India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2233806.ece]. Retrieved 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has also endorsed India's candidature for a permanent seat on the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/153566/china-russia-support-indias-unsc.html]. Retrieved 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Assembly Task Force==
The General Assembly Task Force on Security Council Reform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformtheun.org/index.php?module=uploads%26func=download%26fileId=3220 |title=\ Tracking Developments -&gt; Ensuring Transparency and Accountability |publisher=Reformtheun.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; has delivered a Report (on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council) recommending a compromise solution for entering intergovernmental negotiations on reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformtheun.org/index.php?module=uploads%26func=download%26fileId=3221 |title=\ Tracking Developments -&gt; Ensuring Transparency and Accountability |publisher=Reformtheun.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report builds on existing transitional/intermediary approaches to suggest a &quot;timeline perspective&quot;. The &quot;timeline perspective&quot; suggests that Member States begin by identifying the negotiables to be included in short-term intergovernmental negotiations. Crucial to the &quot;timeline perspective&quot; is the scheduling of a mandatory review conference—a forum for discussing changes to any reforms achieved in the near-term, and for revisiting negotiables that cannot be agreed upon now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformtheun.org/index.php/eupdate/4290 |title=\ Task Force Suggests &quot;Timeline&quot; Solution for Security Council Reform, States Remain Divided |publisher=Reformtheun.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increasing membership==
{{Rquote|right|Asia’s inadequate representation poses a serious threat to the UN’s legitimacy, which will only increase as the world’s most dynamic and populous region assumes an increasingly important global role. One possible way to resolve the problem would be to add at least four Asian seats: one permanent seat for India, one shared by Japan and South Korea (perhaps in a two-year, one-year rotation), one for the ASEAN countries (representing the group as a single constituency), and a fourth rotating among the other Asian countries.|[[Jeffrey Sachs]] at [[Columbia University]]&lt;ref name=&quot;UN 70 reform&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/3-reforms-the-un-needs-as-it-turns-70/ |title=Archive: 3 reforms the UN needs as it turns 70 |accessdate=1 November 2016 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[World Economic Forum]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101124109/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/3-reforms-the-un-needs-as-it-turns-70/ |archivedate=1 November 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
===2005 Annan plan===
On 21 March 2005, the then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] called on the UN to reach a consensus on expanding the council to 24 members, in a plan referred to as &quot;In Larger Freedom&quot;. He gave two alternatives for implementation, but did not specify which proposal he preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&amp;storyID=7953909 |accessdate=22 November 2005 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two options mentioned by Annan are referred to as Plan A and Plan B:
* ''Plan A'' calls for creating six new permanent members, plus three new nonpermanent members for a total of 24&lt;ref&gt;Karen A. Mingst and Margaret P. Karns, The United Nations in the 21st Century (United States: Westview Press, 2012),51.&lt;/ref&gt; seats in the council.
* ''Plan B'' calls for creating eight new seats in a new class of members, who would serve for four years, subject to renewal, plus one nonpermanent seat, also for a total of 24.
In any case, Annan favored making the decision quickly, stating, &quot;This important issue has been discussed for too long. I believe member states should agree to take a decision on it—preferably by consensus, but in any case before the summit—making use of one or other of the options presented in the report of the High-Level Panel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/largerfreedom/sg-statement.html SG statement to GA, 21 March 2005]. United Nations. (21 March 2005). Retrieved 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The summit mentioned by Annan is the September 2005 [[2005 World Summit|Millennium+5 Summit]], a high level plenary meeting that reviewed Annan's report, the implementation of the 2000 [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]], and other UN reform-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-ngls.org/MDG/unaction.htm UN-NGLS Millennium Development Goals – MDG summit +5]. United Nations-ngls.org (31 May 2005). Retrieved 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniting for Consensus===
{{Main article|Uniting for Consensus}}
On 26 July 2005, five UN member countries, [[Italy]], [[Argentina]], Canada, [[Colombia]] and [[Pakistan]], representing a larger group of countries called ''Uniting for Consensus'', proposed to the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] another project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/ga10371.doc.htm 'Uniting For Consensus' Group Of States Introduces Text On Security Council Reform To General Assembly]. United Nations. (26 July 2005). Retrieved 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; that maintains five permanent members and raises the number of non-permanent members to 20.

On May 2011, 120 UN members states participated in a Uniting for Consensus meeting in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esteri.it/MAE/EN/Sala_Stampa/ArchivioNotizie/Approfondimenti/2011/05/20110516_rifonu.htm?LANG=EN |title=Riforma ONU: Frattini, il Consiglio di Sicurezza sia più rappresentativo |date=16 May 2011 |publisher=[[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] |language=Italian |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2011/05/15/news/consiglio_di_sicurezza_onu_roma_con_120_voti_sfida_berlino-16271793/ |title=Consiglio di sicurezza Onu: Roma con 120 voti sfida Berlino |author=Vincenzo Nigro |date=15 May 2011 |publisher=[[La Repubblica]] |language=Italian |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G4 Nations.svg|thumb|left|200px|The [[G4 nations]]: [[Brazil]], [[Germany]], [[India]], and [[Japan]]. The G4 support one anothers' bids for permanent membership, though they are strongly opposed by certain [[Uniting for Consensus|regional rivals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforunreform.org/node/386 |title=Countries Welcome Work Plan as Security Council Reform Process Commences New Phase &amp;#124; Center for UN Reform Education |publisher=Centerforunreform.org |accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One proposed change is to admit more permanent members. The candidates usually mentioned are [[Brazil]], [[Germany]], [[India]], and [[Japan]]. They comprise the group of [[G4 nations]], mutually supporting one another's bids for permanent seats. The United Kingdom, France and Russia support G4 membership in the U.N. Security Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;voa&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=UN Security Council Reform May Shadow Annan's Legacy|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-11-01-voa46.cfm|date=1 November 2006|first=Andre|last=de Nesnera|publisher=Voice of America|archivedate=2 November 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102142909/http://voanews.com/english/2006-11-01-voa46.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sort of reform has traditionally been opposed by the [[Uniting for Consensus]] group, which is composed primarily of nations who are regional rivals and economic competitors of the G4. The group is led by Italy and Spain (opposing Germany), [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] (opposing Brazil), [[Pakistan]] (opposing India), and [[South Korea]] (opposing Japan), in addition to [[Turkey]], [[Indonesia]] and others. Since 1992, Italy and other members of the group have instead proposed semi-permanent seats or the expansion of the number of temporary seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/reform/cluster1/2005/04italianmodel.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515123627/http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/reform/cluster1/2005/04italianmodel.pdf |date=15 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the leading candidates for permanent membership are regularly elected onto the Security Council by their respective groups: Japan was elected for eleven two-year terms, Brazil for ten terms, and Germany for three terms. India has been elected to the council seven times in total, with the most recent successful bid being in 2010 after a gap of almost twenty years since 1991–92.

As of 2013, the current &quot;P5&quot; members of the Security Council, along with the G4, account for eight of the world's [[List of countries by military expenditures|ten largest defense budgets]], according to [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|SIPRI]]. They also account for 9 of the 10 largest economies by both nominal GDP and Purchasing Power Parity GDP.

===Germany===
{{Main article|Germany and the United Nations}}
{{DEU}} is the third largest contributor to the U.N. regular budgets next to Japan, and as such, argues for a permanent Security Council seat. Germany has been elected to the Security Council as a non-permanent member three times as a [[German Reunification|unified state]], as well as three times when it was divided (twice for the [[West Germany|West]], once for the [[East Germany|East]]).

France has explicitly called for a permanent seat in the UN for its close EU partner: &quot;Germany's engagement, its ranking as a [[great power]], its international influence—France would like to see them recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council&quot;, French president [[Jacques Chirac]] said in a speech in Berlin in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/807923.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Chirac pushes two-speed Europe | date=27 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former German [[Chancellor of Germany (1949–)|Chancellor]], [[Gerhard Schröder]], also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid.&lt;ref name=&quot;voa&quot;/&gt; Former President [[Fidel V.

The former German Foreign Minister [[Joschka Fischer]] said that Germany would also accept a common European seat, but as long as there is little sign that France and the UK will give up their own seats, Germany should also have a seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;voa&quot;/&gt;

The German campaign for a permanent seat was intensified in 2004. Schröder made himself perfectly clear in August 2004: &quot;Germany has the right to a seat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1302199,00.html German Hopes for U.N.

Retrieved 14 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Its bid is supported by Japan, India, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and Russia, among other countries. Current German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], who had initially been quiet on the issue, re-stated Germany's bid in her address to the UN General Assembly in September 2007. In July 2011, Merkel's trip to Kenya, Angola, and Nigeria was thought to be motivated, in part, by the goal of seeking support from African countries for Germany's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Allan Odhiambo |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011 |url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Germany+shops+for+UN+seat++business++in+Africa+visit/-/539546/1199806/-/v0u8d9/-/ |title=Germany shops for U.N. seat, business in Africa visit |work=Business Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan has been one of the largest [[Official development assistance]] donor countries. Thus, Japan, along with India, are considered the most likely candidates for two of the new permanent seats. China has stated that it was ready to support India's move for a permanent seat on the UNSC if India did not associate its bid with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2233806.ece | location=Chennai| work=The Hindu | first=Ananth | last=Krishnan | title={{-'}}China ready to support Indian bid for UNSC{{'-}} | date=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be contrary to the Indian stand since Japan and India are both members of the G4 and support each other's candidature. Japan has been elected to the Security Council for eleven terms as a non-permanent member.

Algeria has gained a great deal of respect for its neutrality over the years and its great commitment to African development; [[Egypt]] has the second largest economy in Africa as well as having the biggest military on the continent, was one of the founding members of the United Nations and enjoys great influence in Africa and in the Arab world as well as hosting the Headquarter of the [[Arab League]]; Ethiopia was also one of the founding members of the United Nations and holds the seat of the [[African Union Commission]]; South Africa has the third largest economy on the continent; and Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, has the continent's largest economy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26913497|title=Nigeria becomes Africa's biggest economy - BBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the largest contributors of military and civilian personnel to UN peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.providingforpeacekeeping.org/2015/04/24/peacekeeping-contributor-profile-nigeria/|title=Peacekeeping Contributor Profile: Nigeria|date=24 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veto reform==
{{Main article|United Nations Security Council veto power}}
The UNSC &quot;power of veto&quot; is frequently cited as a major problem within the UN. By wielding their veto power (established by [[Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter]]), any of the UNSC's five permanent members can prevent the adoption of any (non-&quot;procedural&quot;) UNSC draft resolution not to their liking. Even the mere threat of a veto may lead to changes in the text of a resolution, or it being withheld altogether (the so-called &quot;pocket veto&quot;). As a result, the power of veto often prevents the Council from acting to address pressing international issues and affords the &quot;[[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|P5]]&quot; great influence within the UN institution as a whole.

For example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on most major Cold War conflicts, including the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. Resolutions addressing more current problems, such as the conflict between [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Iran]]'s suspected development of nuclear weapons, are also heavily influenced by the veto, actual or threatened.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Additionally, the veto applies to the selection of the UN's [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]], as well as any amendments to the UN Charter, giving the P5 great influence over these processes. Recently China also exercised its VETO on India's Resolution to put Masood Azhar on list of Global terrorist list. He is proclaimed head of Jaish E Mohammad a terror Outfit which is already designated as Global terrorist group by UNSC.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/technical-hold-on-indias-move-to-get-jem-chief-masood-azhars-un-terror-listing-already-extended/articleshow/54628637.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions on improving the UN's effectiveness and responsiveness to international security threats often include reform of the UNSC veto. Proposals include: limiting the use of the veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nonkilling.org/center/download/global-nonkilling-working-papers-11-1950-how-the-opportunity-for-transitioning-to-u-n-collective-security-was-missed-for-the-first-time |title = 1950–How the opportunity for transitioning to U.N. Collective was missed for the first time|last = Schlichtmann|first = Klaus|journal = Global Nonkilling Working Papers #11 (April 14, 2016)}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the [[United Nations Charter]] grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.

==Overall positions on reforming the Security Council==
===United States===
According to a formal statement by the [[United States Department of State]]:
{{quotation|The United States is open to UN Security Council reform and expansion, as one element of an overall agenda for UN reform. We advocate a criteria-based approach under which potential members must be supremely well qualified, based on factors such as: economic size, population, military capacity, commitment to democracy and human rights, financial contributions to the UN, contributions to UN peacekeeping, and record on counterterrorism and nonproliferation. We have to look, of course, at the overall geographic balance of the Council, but effectiveness remains the benchmark for any reform.|[[Bureau of Public Affairs]], 20 June 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/2005/48332.htm|title=U.S. Priorities for a Stronger, More Effective United Nations|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=20 June 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115054909/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/2005/48332.htm|archivedate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to a formal statement by President of the United States Barack Obama in an address to a Joint Session of the [[Indian Parliament]]:
{{quotation| We salute India's long history as a leading [[United Nations peacekeeping#Participation|contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions]]. And we welcome India as it prepares to take its seat on the United Nations Security Council. As two global leaders, the United States and India can partner for global security—especially as India serves on the Security Council over the next two years. Indeed, the just and sustainable international order that America seeks includes a United Nations that is efficient, effective, credible and legitimate. That is why I can say today, in the years ahead, I look forward to a reformed United Nations Security Council that includes India as a permanent member. The United Nations exists to fulfill its founding ideals of preserving peace and security, promoting global cooperation, and advancing human rights. These are the responsibilities of all nations, but especially those that seek to lead in the 21st century. And so we look forward to working with India—and other nations that aspire to Security Council membership—to ensure that the Security Council is effective; that resolutions are implemented, that sanctions are enforced; that we strengthen the international norms which recognize the rights and responsibilities of all nations and all individuals.|[[Barack Obama]], 9 November 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/08/remarks-president-joint-session-indian-parliament-new-delhi-india &quot; Barack Obama in an address to a Joint Session of the Parliament of India&quot;], Lok Sabha, India, 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===United Kingdom and France===
The United Kingdom and France hold similar views on reform to the United Nations Security Council. According to a formal statement made by [[10 Downing Street]]:
{{quotation|
Reform of the UNSC, both its enlargement and the improvement of its working methods, must therefore succeed. We reaffirm the support of our two countries for the candidacies of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan for permanent membership, as well as for permanent representation for Africa on the Council.
We regret that negotiations towards this goal remain in deadlock and are therefore ready to consider an intermediate solution. This could include a new category of seats, with a longer term than those of the current elected members and those terms would be renewable; at the end of an initial phase, it could be decided to turn these new types of seats into permanent ones.
We will work with all our partners to define the parameters of such a reform.
UNSC reform requires a political commitment from the member states at the highest level. We will work in this direction in the coming months with a view to achieving effective reform.| Part of a joint UK-France Summit Declaration—27 March 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page15144|title=Joint UK-France Summit Declaration|date=27 March 2008|publisher=British Prime Minister's Office|accessdate=15 December 2008|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130109092234/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page15144|archivedate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Russia===
As stated by then [[President of Russia]] Dmitry Medvedev at the General Debate of the 64th Session of the United Nations General Assembly:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/64/generaldebate/pdf/RU_en.pdf |title=Statement by Dmitry A. Medvedev, President of the Russian Federation at the 64th Session of the UN General Assembly |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The UN must rationally adapt itself to new world realities. It should also strengthen its influence and preserve its multinational nature and integrity of the UN Charter provisions. The reform of the UN Security Council is an essential component of its revitalization. The time has come to speed up the search for a compromise formula of its expansion and increased efficiency of its work.|[[Dmitry Medvedev]], 23 September 2009}}

===India===
As per the official website of India's Permanent Mission to UN:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.int/india/india_and_the_un_unreform.html |title=India's position on UN Reform Process |publisher=Un.int }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Activities of the Security Council have greatly expanded in the past few years. The success of Security Council's actions depends upon political support of the international community. Any package for restructuring of the Security Council should, therefore, be broad-based. In particular, adequate presence of developing countries is needed in the Security Council. Nations of the world must feel that their stakes in global peace and prosperity are factored into the UN's decision making. Any expansion of permanent members' category must be based on an agreed criteria, rather than be a pre-determined selection. There must be an inclusive approach based on transparent consultations. India supports expansion of both permanent and non-permanent members' category. The latter is the only avenue for the vast majority of Member States to serve on the Security Council. Reform and expansion must be an integral part of a common package.|India's Permanent Mission to UN}}

According to a formal statement by [[List of Prime Ministers of India|13th]] [[Prime Minister of India]] Manmohan Singh at the General Debate of the 59th Session of the United Nations General Assembly:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.int/india/2004/ind984.pdf |title=Prime Minister of India's Address at the 59th Session of United Nations General Assembly, New York |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|It is common knowledge that the United Nations is often unable to exert an effective influence on global economic and political issues of critical importance. This is due to its what may be called as &quot;democracy deficit&quot;, which prevents effective multilateralism, a multilateralism that is based on a democratically-evolved global consensus. Therefore, reform and restructuring of the United Nations system can alone provide a crucial link in an expanding chain of efforts to refashion international structures, imbuing them with a greater degree of participatory decision-making, so as to make them more representative of contemporary realities. The expansion of the Security Council, in the category of both permanent and non-permanent members, and the inclusion of countries like India as permanent members, would be a first step in the process of making the United Nations a truly representative body.|[[Manmohan Singh]], 23 September 2004}}

According to a formal statement by [[List of Prime Ministers of India|14th]] [[Prime Minister of India]] Narendra Modi at the General Debate of the 69th Session of the United Nations General Assembly:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/full-text-of-pm-modi-s-speech-at-unga-114092800002_1.html |title=Prime Minister of India's Address at the 69th Session of United Nations General Assembly, New York |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|We must reform the United Nations, including the Security Council, and make it more democratic and participative. Institutions that reflect the imperatives of 20th century won't be effective in the 21st. It would face the risk of irrelevance; and we will face the risk of continuing turbulence with no one capable of addressing it.
Next year we will be seventy, we should ask ourselves whether we should wait until we are 80 or 100. Let us fulfill our promise to reform the United Nations Security Council by 2015. Let us fulfil our pledge on a post-2015 Development Agenda so that there is new hope and belief in us around the world. Let us make 2m5 also a new watershed for a sustainable world. Let it be the beginning of a new journey together.}}

===Brazil===
As stated by then [[President of Brazil]] Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at the General Debate of the 63rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.int/brazil/speech/008d-CS-agnu-Open%20debate%20230908.html |title=Statement by H.E. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil |publisher=Un.int |date=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The United Nations has spent 15 years discussing the reform of its Security Council. Today's structure has been frozen for six decades and does not relate to the challenges of today's world. Its distorted form of representation stands between us and the multilateral world to which we aspire. Therefore I am much encouraged by the General Assembly's decision to launch negotiations in the near future on the reform of the Security Council.|[[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], 23 September 2008}}

===South Africa===
According to a formal statement by South Africa's International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane speaking in the South African parliament in Cape Town:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.globaltimes.cn/africa/2011-06/660842.html|title=&quot;Statement by South Africa's International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane&quot;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) urgently requires reform to rectify inequitable power relations. We reiterate that the reform of the UNSC is urgent and would go a long way in rectifying inequitable power relations within the Security Council.| [[Maite Nkoana-Mashabane]], 1 June 2011}}

===Portugal===
As stated by former [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] José Sócrates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36178&amp;Cr=general+assembly&amp;Cr1= |title=European leaders press for 'long overdue' UN reform to match changing world |publisher=United Nations |date=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The 15-member Security Council must be enlarged so that it is more representative, transparent and efficient. In our view it is illogical that countries like Brazil or India that have today an irreplaceable economic and political role are still not permanent members of the Security Council. Africa also deserves consideration to take due account of the remarkable political and economic progresses that we have witnessed in that vast continent.|[[José Sócrates]], September 2010}}

===Lithuania===
According to a formal statement by [[Antanas Valionis]], former Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the General Debate of the 58th session of the [[United Nations]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/webcast/ga/58/statements/litheng031001.htm|title=Lithuania|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|The Security Council must be able to take leadership in maintaining international peace and security. Thus Lithuania supports substantial reform for the better, equitable representation in both categories, permanent or non-permanent, through the inclusion of Germany and Japan, as well as certain other leading countries from other regions.|[[Antanas Valionis]], July 2003}}
