On March 9, RSMC Nadi started to monitor a tropical depression had developed within an [[South Pacific Convergence Zone|active convergence zone]], about 150&amp;nbsp;km (95&amp;nbsp;mi) to the northwest of [[Noumea, New Caledonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt; During that day an [[trough (meteorology)|upper level trough]] moved over New Zealand which brought the [[jet stream]] over New Caledonia. As a result, this made the depression hard to locate with satellite imagery.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt; However, later that day despite the system being poorly organized, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical cyclone and named it Zaka.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt; As they named it RSMC Nadi reported that the system had reached its peak 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65&amp;nbsp;km/h (40&amp;nbsp;mph) with further development of the system restricted by strong vertical wind shear.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=RSMC Nadi Best Track Data for the 1995-96 season|url=ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/ibtracs/original-bt-data-files/nadi/RSMC%20Nadi%209596%20BT%20Data.txt.txt|accessdate=June 3, 2011|author=RSMC Nadi&amp;nbsp;— Tropical Cyclone Centre|date=September 17, 2008|work=Fiji Meteorological Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on March 10, the JTWC designated Zaka as Tropical Cyclone 20P, while it had its peak 1-minute windspeeds of 75&amp;nbsp;km/h (45&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=&quot;JTWCATCR&quot;/&gt; RSMC Nadi then issued their final advisory at 0600&amp;nbsp;UTC, as Zaka had weakened into a tropical depression and was moving into TCWC Wellingtons area of responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington BT&quot;/&gt; TCWC Wellington and the JTWC monitored Zaka for another day before it was last noted during March 11 as it became an extratropical cyclone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington BT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weekly tropical cyclone summary #241 March 3&amp;nbsp;- 10 1996|author=Beven, Jack|url=https://groups.google.com/group/sci.geo.meteorology/browse_thread/thread/7eaa7d69ea90b3fd/ff35e614adb9b50b?|date=December 24, 1994|publisher=Google Groups|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaka dumped {{Convert|376|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain on Vanuatu in just 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weatherwatch|author=Thwaytes, Robin|date=March 12, 1996|newspaper=The Guardian|pages=Features: T14}} (Accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, the JTWC started to monitor an area of disturbed weather that had developed within the Australian region about 900&amp;nbsp;km (560&amp;nbsp;mi), to the southeast of [[Port Moresby]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;21P&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/1996/1996s-bsh/bsh211996.txt|accessdate=June 25, 2011|author2=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|title=Tropical Cyclone 21P (Atu) best track analysis|author=Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Centre|date=December 17, 2002|publisher=United States Navy, United States Airforce}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few days, the system remained weak and gradually moved southeast before it crossed 160°E and moved into the basin on March 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;21P&quot;/&gt; During the next day, both the JTWC and RSMC Nadi started to monitor the system as a tropical depression as it moved through the [[Loyalty Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington BT&quot;/&gt; On March 11, the depression intensified into a tropical cyclone as it moved southeastward, prompting RSMC Nadi to name it Atu at 1800&amp;nbsp;UTC.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt; Early on March 12, the JTWC reported that Atu had reached its peak 1-minute windspeeds of 100&amp;nbsp;km/h (65&amp;nbsp;mph).

On March 19, the JTWC started to monitor a tropical disturbance that was located about 1145&amp;nbsp;km (710&amp;nbsp;mi) to the northwest of [[Suva|Suva, Fiji]].&lt;ref name=&quot;23P&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1996|title=Tropical Cyclone 23P (Beti) best track analysis|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/1996/1996s-bsh/bsh231996.txt|author=Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Centre|author2=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=June 16, 2011|publisher=United States Navy, United States Airforce}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next couple of days the system moved towards the south and gradually developed further in an area of low vertical windshear, before the system was designated as Tropical Depression 23P by the JTWC and RSMC Nadi on March 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;JTWCATCR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;23P&quot;/&gt; Over the next couple of days, 23P moved further towards the south, before the depression started to move towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt; Later that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt; During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the [[Coral Sea]] on March 24, after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of [[Pentecost Island|Pentecost]] and [[Malekula Island|Malekula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington BT&quot;/&gt; As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly intensified further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington BT&quot;/&gt; As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt; As a result, the system started to move towards the south-southeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington BT&quot;/&gt;

Over the next couple of days Beti continued to intensify as it moved towards New Caledonia, before the JTWC reported at 1800&amp;nbsp;UTC on March 26, that Beti had reached its peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 195&amp;nbsp;km/h (120&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=&quot;23P&quot;/&gt; Six hours later, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had peaked as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 165&amp;nbsp;km/h (105&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington BT&quot;/&gt; Later on March 27, Severe Tropical Cyclone Beti made landfall on the [[New Caledonia|Grande Terre island]] of New Caledonia near its peak intensity and quickly weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt; During the next day, Beti moved towards the southeast under the influence of the trough, reemerging into the Coral Sea as a weakening tropical cyclone that had started to transition into an extratropical cyclone.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt; Later on March 28, RSMC Nadi passed the primary warning responsibility of the cyclone to TCWC Wellington, before the JTWC issued their final advisory on Beti as it had become extratropical.&lt;ref name=&quot;95-96 SS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington BT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;23P&quot;/&gt; Over the next few days, TCWC Wellington continued to monitor Beti's remnants, as they came under the influence of a high pressure area and moved around New Zealand's East Coast, before they were last noted on April 2 while located about 1400&amp;nbsp;km (870&amp;nbsp;mi) to the southeast of Wellington.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington BT&quot;/&gt;
