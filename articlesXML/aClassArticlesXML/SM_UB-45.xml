'''SM ''UB-45''''' was a [[German Type UB II submarine|Type UB II]] [[submarine]] or [[U-boat]] built for and operated by the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during [[World War I]]. ''UB-45'' operated in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Black Sea]]s, and was sunk by a [[mine (naval)|mine]] in November 1916.

''UB-45'' was ordered in July 1915 and was [[keel laying|laid down]] at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]] in September. ''UB-45'' was about {{convert|37|m|ftin}} in length and [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] between {{convert|270|and|305|t|LT}}, depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She was equipped to carry a complement of four torpedoes for her two bow [[torpedo tube]]s and had an {{convert|5|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[deck gun]]. As part of a group of six submarines selected for Mediterranean service, ''UB-45'' was broken into railcar-sized components and shipped to [[Pula|Pola]] where she was assembled and then launched and [[Ship commissioning|commission]]ed in May 1916.

In five patrols in her six-month career, ''UB-45'' sank four ships of {{GRT|15,361|disp=long}}. In early November 1916, ''UB-45'' was departing from the base at [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]], when the U-boat struck a mine and sank rapidly. Fifteen of the twenty men on board were killed in the attack; one of the five crewmen rescued from ''UB-45'' later died from his injuries. ''UB-45''{{'}}s wreck was located and raised by the [[Bulgarian Navy]] in the 1930s with an eye toward rebuilding the submarine. Engineers from AG Weser determined that restoration of the submarine was feasible, but this was never accomplished. Remains recovered from the wreck were buried in Varna after a funeral procession through town in November 1938.

== Design and construction ==
The [[German Type UB II submarine|German UB II]] design improved upon the design of the [[German Type UB I submarine|UB I boats]], which had been ordered in September 1914.&lt;ref name=Con-174&gt;Gardiner, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; In service, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow. A major problem was that, because they had a single [[propeller shaft (ship)|propeller shaft]]/engine combo, if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled.&lt;ref name=Miller-48&gt;Miller, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; To rectify this flaw, the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine), which also increased the U-boat's top speed.&lt;ref name=Will-13&gt;Williamson, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The new design also included more powerful batteries,&lt;ref name=Miller-48 /&gt; larger [[torpedo tube]]s, and a [[deck gun]].&lt;ref name=Tarrant-172&gt;Tarrant, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; As a UB II boat, ''U-45'' could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts, and nearly ten times as much fuel.&lt;ref name=Tarrant-172 /&gt; To contain all of these changes the [[submarine hull|hull]] was larger,&lt;ref name=Miller-48 /&gt; and the surface and submerged [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was more than double that of the UB I boats.&lt;ref name=Tarrant-172 /&gt;

The German Imperial Navy ordered ''UB-45'' from [[AG Weser]] on 31 July 1915 as one of a series of six UB II boats (numbered from {{SMU|UB-42||2}} to {{SMU|UB-47||2}}).&lt;ref name=Tarrant-172 /&gt; ''UB-45'' was {{convert|36.90|m|ftin}} long and {{convert|4.37|m|ftin}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]]. She had a [[submarine hull|single hull]] with [[saddle tank (submarine)|saddle tank]]s and had a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|3.68|m|ftin}} when surfaced. She displaced {{convert|305|t|LT}} while submerged but only {{convert|272|t|LT}} on the surface.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=23-25}}

The submarine was equipped with twin [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler]] [[diesel engine]]s and twin [[Siemens-Schuckert]] [[electric motor]]s—for surfaced and submerged running, respectively. ''UB-45'' had a surface speed of up to {{convert|8.82|kn}} and could go as fast as {{convert|6.22|kn}} while underwater.&lt;ref name=Tarrant-172 /&gt; The U-boat could carry up to {{convert|27|t|LT}} of diesel fuel, giving her a range of {{convert|6,940|nmi}}at {{convert|5|kn}}. Her electric motors and batteries provided a range of {{convert|45|nmi}}at {{convert|4|kn}} while submerged. ''UB-45'' was equipped with two {{convert|50|cm|in|1|sp=us|adj=on}} bow [[torpedo tube]]s and could carry four [[torpedo]]es. The U-boat was also armed with one {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} Uk L/30 deck gun.{{sfn|Gröner|1991|pp=23-25}}

''UB-45'' was laid down by AG Weser at its [[Bremen]] shipyard on 3 September 1915.&lt;ref name=UB-45 /&gt; As one of six U-boats selected for service in the Mediterranean while under construction, ''UB-45'' was broken into railcar-sized components and shipped overland to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] port of [[Pula|Pola]].&lt;ref name=Hal-383&gt;Halpern, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller-49&gt;Miller, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Shipyard workers from Weser assembled the boat and her five sisters at Pola,&lt;ref name=Hal-383 /&gt; where she was launched on 12 May 1916.&lt;ref name=UB-45 /&gt;

== Service career ==
SM ''UB-45'' was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 26 May 1916 under the command of ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' Karl Palis.&lt;ref name=UB-45 /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The 31-year-old Palis had been in the Navy's April 1904 cadet class with 20 other future U-boat captains, including [[Wilhelm Canaris]].&lt;br /&gt;For Palis information, see: {{cite Uboat.net

}} Palis had previously commanded {{SMU|UC-12||2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was assigned to the Navy's [[Pola Flotilla]] ({{lang-de|Deutsche U-Halbflotille Pola}}).&lt;ref name=UB-45 /&gt; Although the flotilla was based in Pola, the site of the main [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] base, boats of the flotilla operated out of the Austro-Hungarian base at [[Cattaro]] which was located farther south and closer to the Mediterranean. German U-boats typically returned to Pola only for repairs.&lt;ref name=Halp-384&gt;Halpern, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-July, ''UB-45''{{'}}s first success occurred when in three days she sank two steamers.&lt;ref name=UB45-ships /&gt; The first, ''Virginia'', was sunk on the 16th while carrying salt destined for [[Calcutta]]. Two men on board the 4,279-ton British ship were lost when she went down {{convert|42|nmi}} off [[Cape Matapan]].&lt;ref name=virg&gt;{{cite Uboat.net
|name=Virginia
|id=7303
|type=1ship
|accessdate=13 February 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the French ship ''Ville de Rouen'' was sunk {{convert|120|nmi}} southwest of Cape Matapan.&lt;ref name=ville&gt;{{cite Uboat.net
|name=Ville De Rouen
|id=6352
|type=1ship
|accessdate=13 February 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4,721-ton ''Ville de Rouen'' would be ''UB-45''{{'}}s largest victim.&lt;ref name=UB45-ships /&gt;

[[Romania during World War I|Germany's conquest of Romania]] provided the German Imperial Navy with sufficient [[fuel oil]] for submarines to operate in the [[Black Sea]]. ''UB-45'' and three of her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and, en route, had to navigate through the [[Dardanelles]], which had been heavily [[mine (naval)|mined]] by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the middle of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The other three boats were {{SMU|UB-42||2}}, {{SMU|UB-44||2}}, and {{SMU|UB-46||2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''UB-45'' joined the [[Constantinople Flotilla]] ({{lang-de|U-boote der Mittelmeerdivision in Konstantinopal}}) on 12 August.&lt;ref name=UB-45 /&gt;

The German submarines in the Black Sea accomplished little, sinking only six ships between August and the end of the year;&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; ''UB-45'' accounted for two of these while in the Black Sea. On 31 August, ''UB-45'' sank the 2,660-ton Italian steamer ''Tevere'' off [[Poti]]. ''Tevere'' had been requisitioned&lt;!--source does not explain further--&gt; by the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and was in use as a [[transport ship]] at the time.&lt;ref name=tev&gt;{{cite Uboat.net
|name=Tevere
|id=5957
|type=1ship
|accessdate=13 February 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the U-boat torpedoed the 3,701-ton ''Gioconda'', another Russian transport, {{convert|45|nmi}} off [[Trabzon|Trebizond]].&lt;ref name=gio&gt;{{cite Uboat.net
|name=Gioconda
|id=2459
|type=1ship
|accessdate=13 February 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;''Gioconda'' was towed into Trebizond and converted to a landing platform, making the ship an apparent total loss.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gioconda'' was the last ship sunk by ''UB-45''.&lt;ref name=UB45-ships /&gt;

[[File:SM UB-45 funeral.jpg|thumb|left|The 13 November 1938 funeral procession for ''UB-45''{{'}}s crewmen after the U-boat's 1936 recovery.]]
At 14:30 on 6 November, ''UB-45'' was departing [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]], under escort by the Bulgarian [[torpedo boat]] ''Strogi'' that had cleared a path through Russian [[mine (naval)|mine]]s.&lt;ref name=Mess-166&gt;Messimer, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Messimer identifies the Bulgarian ship as the destroyer ''Stragi''. ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921'' (pp. 411–12) reports no such ship, but does report a Bulgarian [[torpedo boat]] named ''Strogi''.&lt;/ref&gt; At what was thought to be the edge of the minefield, ''UB-45'' swung around ''Strogi''{{'}}s port side directly into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A [[Hertz horn mine]] exploded between ''UB-45''{{'}}s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. ''UB-45'' sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the [[conning tower]] and two on deck, all of whom were injured;&lt;ref name=Mess-166 /&gt; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack.&lt;ref name=UB-45 /&gt; One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.&lt;ref name=Mess-166 /&gt;

In 1932, the [[Bulgarian Navy]] conceived a plan to search for the wreck of ''UB-45'' with the intent of raising it for restoration as a training vessel, or, at the very least, to recover the sunken U-boat's {{convert|8.8|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} deck gun. An additional consideration was the recovery of the remains of ''UB-45''{{'}}s crew. On 19 July 1934, after a two-year search, Bulgarian [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s discovered the location of the wreck, which was resting at position {{coord|43|12|N|28|09|E}}, near the then Bulgarian–Romanian border. ''UB-45''{{'}}s wreck was raised in an operation that cost several times less than the cost of a new 8.8-centimeter gun. The remains recovered were buried on 26 February 1936 in a Varna cemetery, after a procession through the town.&lt;ref name=Voenno&gt;{{cite journal | last = Panayotov | first = Atanas |title=Why were the underwater activities not resumed in Bulgaria in the period 1936-1939? | journal = Военноисторически Сборник | language = Bulgarian | issn = 0204-4080 | year = 2006 | issue = 4 | oclc = 5312775 | pages = 45–48 |url=http://vi-books.com/vis/vis6/vis6.4/vis6.4.pdf | format = pdf|accessdate=25 February 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers from AG Weser, ''UB-45''{{'}}s German builder, inspected the hulk and determined that repair of the wreck was feasible.&lt;ref name=Voenno /&gt; A restoration of the submarine to operating condition, as either a training vessel or a military, would cost 21 million [[Bulgarian lev|leva]] (about US$250,000 in 1936 dollars), significantly less than the 56 to 65 million leva ($680,000 to $790,000) that a comparable new submarine would cost.&lt;ref name=Voenno /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In 1936, 100 [[Bulgarian lev|leva]] equalled about US$1.22. See: Brandt, p. xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Bulgarian Navy opted to order new submarines from Germany rather than repair ''UB-45''.&lt;ref name=Voenno /&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Bulgarian submarine order was cancelled by Germany after the start of [[World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''UB-45''{{'}}s deck gun was reused, however, and one of the U-boat's diesel engines was restored to operating condition and used on the training ship ''Assen''.&lt;ref name=Voenno /&gt;
