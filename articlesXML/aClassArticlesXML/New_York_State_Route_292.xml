'''New York State Route&amp;nbsp;292''' ('''NY&amp;nbsp;292''') is a short [[state highway]] in the [[Hudson Valley]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] in the United States, bridging [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] and [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]] counties. The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with [[New York State Route 311|NY&amp;nbsp;311]] in the town of [[Patterson, New York|Patterson]], and the northern terminus is at a junction with [[New York State Route 55|NY&amp;nbsp;55]] in the [[Pawling (town), New York|town of Pawling]]. NY&amp;nbsp;292 traverses mostly rural areas as it heads northwestward through Patterson and Pawling. Along the way, NY&amp;nbsp;292 passes along the southern and western edges of [[Whaley Lake]].

The portion of NY&amp;nbsp;292 between West Patterson and Whaley Lake originated as a dirt road named the Patterson–Dutchess County Line Road. This road was reconstructed in 1919 and became part of [[New York State Route 39 (1920s)|NY&amp;nbsp;39]], a highway extending from [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] to Patterson by way of West Pawling, in the 1920s. In the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]], the segment of NY&amp;nbsp;39 from [[East Fishkill, New York|East Fishkill]] to West Patterson was incorporated into the new [[New York State Route 52|NY&amp;nbsp;52]]. By the end of the 1930s, the portion of NY&amp;nbsp;52 from Stormville to West Patterson was renumbered to [[New York State Route 216|NY&amp;nbsp;216]]. In 1970, NY&amp;nbsp;216 was truncated to its current length and NY&amp;nbsp;216's former alignment from West Pawling to Patterson was renumbered to NY&amp;nbsp;292.

==Route description==

NY&amp;nbsp;292 begins at [[New York State Route 311|NY&amp;nbsp;311]] near the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Patterson, New York|Patterson]]. It heads west initially, paralleling the [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]]–[[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]] county line as it passes south of the Patterson Veteran Memorial Park and intersects [[County Route 63 (Putnam County, New York)|County Route&amp;nbsp;63]] (CR&amp;nbsp;63). It crosses a minor stream and briefly turns towards the southwest. After passing through the hamlet of West Patterson, NY&amp;nbsp;292 turns northwest, crosses the stream once again, and enters [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]]. Just north of the county line in the [[Pawling (town), New York|Pawling]] hamlet of Holmes, the route intersects with [[County Route 30 (Dutchess County, New York)|CR&amp;nbsp;30]]. Near Holmes, the highway heads due north and passes between two small ponds.&lt;ref name=rd /&gt;

The route continues onward, traveling north through a rural, wooded area of Pawling with little development before curving west to pass along the southern edge of [[Whaley Lake]]. At the southwestern tip of the lake, NY&amp;nbsp;292 turns north, paralleling the western and northern shores of the lake as it heads toward the hamlet of West Pawling. North of the lake in West Pawling, NY&amp;nbsp;292 turns east onto a former routing of [[New York State Route 55|NY&amp;nbsp;55]] for a short distance before ending at modern NY&amp;nbsp;55 in the northwest corner of Pawling.&lt;ref name=rd&gt;{{Google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=from:+RT-292%20@41.512445,%20-73.617494+to:+RT-292%20@41.583834,%20-73.659644 |title=overview map of NY 292 |accessdate=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:New York State Route 292.jpg|thumb|right|NY&amp;nbsp;292 just east of where the route leaves Old [[New York State Route 55|NY&amp;nbsp;55]]|alt=A road in a forested area. The surrounded land is covered with a layer of snow.]]
Part of the highway was once part of the Patterson–Dutchess County Line Road, a {{convert|1.61|mi|2|sing=on}} dirt road that extended from Banks Corner to Whaley Lake. Plans were finalized in 1919 to rebuild the previously inadequate road; the project cost an estimated $43,500 ($517,298 2007 USD), including $15,225 ($181,054 2007 USD) of Putnam County's portion of the construction. In May 1919, the ''[[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] News'' reported, &quot;On the road between Sodom and Pawling turn left and run through Patterson and continue to West Patterson. From West Patterson a new road about one and one-half miles in length is under construction which connects with a good macadam road passing Whaley Pond and running to Stonehouse, thence continuing ... to Newburgh.&quot; The new road was completed in November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Historic Patterson|title=From Dirt Roads to the Interstate Highway|year=|publisher=The Town of Patterson NY|accessdate=December 21, 2008|url=http://www.historicpatterson.org/Exhibits/ExhHighways.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NY&amp;nbsp;292 was originally part of [[New York State Route 39 (1920s)|NY&amp;nbsp;39]] in the 1920s, which ran from [[Patterson, New York|Patterson]] to [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] via West Patterson and East Fishkill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/unitedstates1926ra_009.html |title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas (eastern New York) |publisher=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1926 |accessdate=February 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]], the portion of NY&amp;nbsp;39 between East Fishkill and the western fringe of Patterson was redesignated as part of the new [[New York State Route 52|NY&amp;nbsp;52]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Leon A. |last=Dickinson |title=New Signs for State Highways |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 12, 1930 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between Patterson and [[New York State Route 22|NY&amp;nbsp;22]], old NY&amp;nbsp;39 was renumbered to [[New York State Route 311|NY&amp;nbsp;311]].&lt;ref&gt;''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930–31 and 1931–32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930–31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]&lt;/ref&gt;

NY&amp;nbsp;52 was realigned {{circa|1937}} to follow its current alignment between [[Stormville, New York|Stormville]] and [[Lake Carmel, New York|Lake Carmel]]. The former routing of NY&amp;nbsp;52 between Stormville and Patterson became part of [[New York State Route 216|NY&amp;nbsp;216]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Standard Oil Company]] |year=1936 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=Standard Oil Company |year=1937 |cartography=General Drafting}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route remained unchanged until January&amp;nbsp;1, 1970, when NY&amp;nbsp;216 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in [[Poughquag, New York|Poughquag]]. As part of the truncation, its former alignment from West Pawling to Patterson was renumbered to NY&amp;nbsp;292.&lt;ref name=&quot;1970log&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.greaternyroads.info/pdfs/state70.pdf |title=Official Description of Touring Routes in New York State |date=January 1, 1970 |author=[[State of New York Department of Transportation]] |format=PDF |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
