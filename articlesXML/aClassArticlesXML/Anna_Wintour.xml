'''Anna Wintour''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|t|ər}}; born 3 November 1949) is a British-American&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/obama-anna-wintour-ambassador-uk-397574 &quot;Obama supporter Anna Wintour reportedly considered for ambassadorial post by administration&quot;], hollywoodreporter.com; accessed 10 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Rovzar, [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2008/11/anna_wintour_rest_of_city_turn.html &quot;Anna Wintour, Rest of City Turn Out to Vote&quot;], nymag.com, November 2008; accessed 11 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; journalist and editor. She has been editor-in-chief of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' since 1988.

In 2013, she became artistic director for [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]], ''Vogue''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s publisher. With her trademark [[pageboy]] [[bob cut|bob haircut]] and dark sunglasses, Wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world, widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger [[fashion designer|designers]]. Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname &quot;[[nuclear winter|Nuclear Wintour]]&quot;.

The eldest daughter of [[Charles Wintour]], editor of the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' (1959–76), her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. She became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her career in [[fashion journalism]] began at two British magazines. Later, she moved to the United States, with stints at ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' and ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]]''. She returned to London for a year to turn around British ''Vogue'', and later assumed control of the franchise's magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it. [[Animal rights]] activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.

A former personal assistant, [[Lauren Weisberger]], wrote the 2003 best selling ''[[roman à clef]]'' ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', later made into a successful [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|film]] starring [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Miranda Priestly]], a fashion editor, believed to be based on Wintour. In 2009, she was the focus of another film, [[R.J. Cutler]]'s documentary ''[[The September Issue]]''.

==Family==
Wintour was born in London in 1949, to [[Charles Wintour]] (1917–1999), editor of the ''Evening Standard'', and Eleanor &quot;Nonie&quot; Trego Baker (1917-1995), an American, the daughter of a Harvard law professor. Her parents married in 1940 and divorced in 1979. Wintour was named after her maternal grandmother, Anna Baker (née Gilkynson), a merchant's daughter from Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer2&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wq3WpfuFc1oC&amp;pg=PA2 2]. &quot;Eleanor Baker, an American, met Wintour at Cambridge University in England in the fall of 1939 ... [Her mother], Anna Gilkyson Baker, for whom Anna Wintour was named, was a charming, matronly, somewhat ditzy society girl from Philadelphia's [[Pennsylvania Main Line|Main Line]] ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Audrey Slaughter, a magazine editor who founded publications such as ''[[Honey (UK magazine)|Honey]]'' and ''Petticoat'', is her stepmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer99&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 99. &quot;...[H]er animosity intensif[ied] after her father married Slaughter.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Media in Britain&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Media in Britain|last=Tunstall|first=Jeremy|year=1983|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-05816-0|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p4J80JqdUZgC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Audrey+Slaughter%22%2Bhoney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eo8Oj1EnEp&amp;sig=Le8_KvxWLb93SpVdLNSMiOPai0I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vUcRTMXmD8OclgfQlvDpBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Audrey%20Slaughter%22%2Bhoney&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 June 2010|quote=...[F]or example a newish magazine is often identified with a particular editor; an example is the association of Audrey Slaughter in the 1960s and 70s with a succession of young women's publications — ''Honey'', Petticoat'', and ''Over 21''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late-18th-century novelist [[Elizabeth Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Lady Elizabeth Foster]], Duchess of Devonshire, was Wintour's great-great-great-grandmother, and [[Foster baronets|Sir Augustus Vere Foster]], the last Baronet of that name, was a granduncle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lady Foster&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Georgiana Duchess of Devonshire|last=Masters|first=Brian|year=1981|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London, UK|isbn=0-241-10662-1|pages=298–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had four siblings. Her older brother, Gerald, died in a traffic accident as a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer6&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 6&lt;/ref&gt; One of her younger brothers, [[Patrick Wintour|Patrick]], is also a journalist, currently political editor of ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patrick Wintour&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour Patrick Wintour, chief political correspondent]; ''The Guardian''; retrieved 6 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; James and Nora Wintour have worked in London local government and for international non-governmental organisations, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camden News Journal story&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Osley|first=Richard|title=Former Camden Town Hall director Jim Wintour 'quit over pension' – Housing boss feared new tax proposal|url=http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2010/may/former-camden-town-hall-director-jim-wintour-%E2%80%98quit-over-pension%E2%80%99-housing-boss-feared-n|newspaper=[[Camden New Journal]]|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010|quote=Mr Wintour, who is brother of Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
In her youth, Wintour was educated at the independent [[North London Collegiate School]], where she frequently rebelled against the [[Social aspects of clothing#Private dress codes|dress code]] by taking up the [[hemline]]s of her skirts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer15&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 15&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 14, she began wearing her hair in a [[bob cut|bob]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer21&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of [[Cathy McGowan (presenter)|Cathy McGowan]] on ''[[Ready Steady Go!]],''&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer22&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and from the issues of ''[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]'' which her grandmother sent from the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;The September Issue 19:05&quot;&gt;''The September Issue'', 0:19.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Growing up in [[Swinging London|London in the '60s]], you'd have to have had Irving Penn's sack over your head not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion,&quot; she recalled.&lt;ref name=&quot;September Issue 18:35&quot;&gt;''The September Issue'', 0:18.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer22&quot;/&gt;

At the age of 15, she began dating well-connected older men. She was involved briefly with [[Piers Paul Read]], then 24.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer31-35&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 31–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In her later teens, she and gossip columnist [[Nigel Dempster]] became a fixture on the London club circuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer36-37&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===From fashion to journalism===
&quot;I think my father really decided for me that I should work in fashion,&quot; she recalled in ''[[The September Issue]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The September Issue 19:05&quot;/&gt; He arranged for his daughter's first job, at the influential [[Biba]] boutique, when she was 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer42-44&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at [[Harrods]]. At her parents' behest, she also took fashion classes at a nearby school. Soon she gave them up, saying, &quot;You either know fashion or you don't.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer51&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Another older boyfriend, [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]], gave her her first experience of magazine production at his popular and controversial ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer58-62&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 58–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, when ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harper's Bazaar UK]]'' merged with ''Queen'' to become ''Harper's &amp; Queen'', Wintour was hired as one of its first editorial assistants, beginning her career in [[fashion journalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer63&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; She told her co-workers that she wanted to edit ''Vogue''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer70&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, she discovered model [[Annabel Hodin]], a former North London classmate. Her connections helped her secure locations for innovative shoots by [[Helmut Newton]], [[Jim Lee (Photographer and Film Director)|Jim Lee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Jo|title=A Scooterman's Portfolio|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2005/sep/11/photography.fashion|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 September 2005|accessdate=25 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other trend-setting photographers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer81&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 81. &quot;She quickly built up a reputation of being able to round up the best people and locations, mainly because of her connections through her father, pals like Nigel Dempster, and other well-placed people she met socially.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; One recreated the works of [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and [[Manet]] using models in [[go-go boots]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Met bio&quot;&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art; 12 January 1999; [http://www.metmuseum.org/Press_Room/full_release.asp?prid={44C504B8-C28F-11D3-936E-00902786BF44} Anna Wintour elected honorary trustee]. Retrieved 6 December 2006. {{wayback|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Press_Room/full_release.asp?prid={44C504B8-C28F-11D3-936E-00902786BF44} |date=20071119020206 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; After chronic disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer96&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; she quit and moved to New York with her boyfriend, freelance journalist Jon Bradshaw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer100&quot;&gt;Oppenhimer, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York City===
In her new home, she became a junior fashion editor at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' in New York City in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Met bio&quot; /&gt; Wintour's innovative shoots led editor Tony Mazzola to fire her after nine months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer109&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; She was introduced to [[Bob Marley]] by one of Bradshaw's friends, and disappeared with him for a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer107&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Bradshaw helped her get her first position as a fashion editor, at ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'', a women's adult magazine started by [[Kathy Keeton]], then wife of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' publisher [[Bob Guccione]]. She has rarely discussed working there, due to that connection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer118&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first job at which she was able to hire a personal assistant, which began her reputation as a demanding and difficult boss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer120&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1978, Guccione shut down the unprofitable magazine. Wintour decided to take some time off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a relationship with French record producer [[Michel Esteban]], for two years dividing her time with him between Paris and New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer152&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to work in 1980, succeeding [[Elsa Klensch]] as fashion editor for a new women's magazine named ''Savvy''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot;&gt;Larson, Christina; April 2005; [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0504.larson2.html From Venus To Minerva]; ''Washington Monthly''. Retrieved 11 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It sought to appeal to career-conscious professional women, who spent their own money,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer159&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; the readers Wintour would later target at ''Vogue''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot;&gt;Fortini, Amanda; 10 February 2005; [http://www.slate.com/id/2113278/ Defending ''Vogue'''s evil genius]; Slate.com; retrieved 6 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, she became fashion editor of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;Met bio&quot;/&gt; There, the fashion spreads and photo shoots she had been putting together for years finally began attracting attention. Editor Edward Kosner sometimes bent very strict rules for her and let her work on other sections of the magazine. She learned through her work on a cover involving [[Rachel Ward]] how effectively celebrity covers sold copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer188&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Anna saw the celebrity thing coming before everyone else did,&quot; Grace Coddington said three decades later.&lt;ref name=&quot;September Issue 1:12:00&quot;&gt;''The September Issue'', 1:12:00.&lt;/ref&gt; A former colleague arranged for an interview with ''Vogue'' editor [[Grace Mirabella]] that ended when Wintour told Mirabella she wanted her job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Gray profile 4&quot;&gt;Gray, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer190&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condé Nast===
She went to work at ''Vogue'' later when Alex Liberman, editorial director for [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]], publisher of ''Vogue'', talked to Wintour about a position there in 1983. She eventually accepted after a bidding war that doubled her salary, becoming the magazine's first creative director, a position with vaguely defined responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer207&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Her changes to the magazine were often made without Mirabella's knowledge, causing friction among the staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer208-10&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, pp. 208-10.&lt;/ref&gt; She began dating child psychiatrist [[David Shaffer]], an older acquaintance from London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer193&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; They married in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer223&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Wintour attained her first editorship, taking over British ''Vogue'' after [[Beatrix Miller]] retired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer230&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in charge, she replaced many staffers and exerted far more control over the magazine than any previous editor had, earning the nickname &quot;Nuclear Wintour&quot; in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer243&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Those editors who were retained began to refer to the period as &quot;The Wintour of Our Discontent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer240&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Her changes moved the magazine from its traditional eccentricity to a direction more in line with the American magazine. Wintour's ideal reader was the same woman ''Savvy'' had tried to reach. &quot;There's a new kind of woman out there,&quot; she told the ''Evening Standard.'' &quot;She's interested in business and money. She doesn't have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot;/&gt;

In 1987, Wintour returned to New York to take over ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]].'' Its circulation had long lagged behind rival ''[[Architectural Digest]],''&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer269&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; and Condé Nast hoped she could improve it. Again, she made radical changes to staff and look, canceling $2&amp;nbsp;million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time 1988&quot;&gt;Zuckerman, Lawrence; 13 June 1988; [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967685-1,00.html The Dynamic Duo at Condé Nast], time.com; retrieved 8 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She put so much fashion in photo spreads that it became known as ''House &amp; Garment'', and enough celebrities that it was referred to as ''Vanity Chair'', within the industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot;/&gt;
[[File:November 1988 Vogue cover.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Wintour's first ''Vogue'' cover|alt=November 1988 cover of American Vogue magazine, showing model Michaela Bercu, shot from just below the waist in natural outdoor light, wearing a $10,000 jewel-encrusted Christian LaCroix T-shirt with faded 450 jeans. The top headline on the cover reads &quot;The real cost of looking good&quot;]]
Those changes worsened the magazine's problems. When the title was shortened to just ''HG'', many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside for the real thing to arrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer269&quot;/&gt; Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine's traditional advertisers pulled out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer271&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten months later, she finally became editor of ''Vogue''. Under Mirabella, it had become more focused on lifestyles as a whole and less on fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot;/&gt; Industry insiders worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot;/&gt; After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight [[head shot]]s of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those [[Diana Vreeland]] had done years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot;/&gt; She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with the high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a [[Peter Lindbergh]] photograph of 19-year-old [[Michaela Bercu]] in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by [[Christian Lacroix]] worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot;/&gt; (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).

In 2012, Wintour reflected on the cover:{{quote|It was so unlike the studied and elegant close-ups that were typical of Vogue’s covers back then, with tons of makeup and major jewelry. This one broke all the rules. Michaela wasn't looking at you, and worse, she had her eyes almost closed. Her hair was blowing across her face. It looked easy, casual, a moment that had been snapped on the street, which it had been, and which was the whole point. Afterwards, in the way that these things can happen, people applied all sorts of interpretations: It was about mixing high and low, Michaela was pregnant, it was a religious statement. But none of these things was true. I had just looked at that picture and sensed the winds of change. And you can’t ask for more from a cover image than that.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintour on Bercu cover&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wintour|first=Anna|title=Honoring the 120th Anniversary: Anna Wintour Shares Her Vogue Story|url=http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/anna-wintour-on-her-first-vogue-cover-plus-a-slideshow-of-her-favorite-images-in-vogue/#1|publisher=''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''|date=14 August 2012|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Years later, Wintour admitted the photo had never been planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when ''Vogue'' put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, &quot;I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, 'This is something new. This is something different.'  The printers called to make sure that was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS News 2011 interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Vogue puts its 120-year history online|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-57340950/vogue-puts-its-120-year-history-online|newspaper=CBS News|date=11 December 2011|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. &quot;[I]t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for ''Vogue''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2015 New York interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=LaRocca|first=Amy|title=In Conversation With Anna Wintour|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/anna-wintour-amy-larocca-in-conversation.html|newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=4 May 2015|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Wintour's approach hit a nerve—this was the way real women put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts),&quot; one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a bathrobe and no apparent makeup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot; /&gt; Photographers, makeup artists, and hairstylists got credited along with the models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot;/&gt; In August 2014, [[Gigi Hadid]] paid tribute to Wintour's first cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/1019685/gigi-hadid-vogue-cover/|title=Gigi Hadid, Model of the Moment, Pays Tribute to Anna Wintour’s First ''Vogue'' Cover|last=Thomas|first=Mark Guiducci, Sean|website=Vogue|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
Under her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under Vreeland. ''Vogue'' held its position as market leader against three contenders: ''Elle''; ''Harper's Bazaar'', which had lured away [[Liz Tilberis]], Wintour's most prominent deputy, and ''[[Mirabella]]'', a magazine [[Rupert Murdoch]] created for Wintour's fired predecessor. Her most serious competitor was within the company: [[Tina Brown]], editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and later ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer293-96&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, pp. 293-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the decade, another of Wintour's inner circle left to run ''Harper's Bazaar''. [[Kate Betts]], seen as Wintour's likely successor, had broadened the magazine's reach by commissioning stories with a more hard-news edge, about women in politics, street culture, and the financial difficulties of some major designers. She had also added the &quot;Index&quot; section, a few pages of tips meant to be torn out of the magazine. At staff meetings, she earned Wintour's respect as the only person who publicly challenged her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Gray profile 2&quot;&gt;Gray, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two began to disagree about the magazine's direction. Betts felt ''Vogue''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s fashion coverage was getting too limited. Wintour in turn thought that the stories with [[popular culture]] angles Betts was assigning were beneath readers, and began pairing Betts with [[Plum Sykes]], whom Betts reportedly detested as a &quot;pretentious airhead.&quot; Eventually, she left, complaining to the ''New York Times'' that Wintour had not even sent her a baby gift. Wintour wrote an editor's letter that complimented Betts and wished her well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Gray profile 3&quot;&gt;Gray, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
Betts was one of several longtime editors to leave ''Vogue'' around the new millennium. A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city's upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements didn't last, a new group of core editors formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Observer Plum Sykes story&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Snyder|first=Gabriel|title=Bright Young Thing, Plum Sykes, Abandons Vogue, Sort Of|url=http://www.observer.com/node/43767|work=The New York Observer|date=17 December 2000|accessdate=11 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100513182359/http://www.observer.com/node/43767| archivedate= 13 May 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year was generally difficult, as the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|economy worsened]]. After ruffling feathers at the Milan shows in February, the April issue's cover image of [[LeBron James]] and [[Gisele Bündchen]] brought criticism for its evocation of [[racial stereotypes]]. The next month a lavish [[Karl Lagerfeld]] gown she wore to the Met's Costume Institute Gala was called &quot;the worst fashion ''faux pas'' of 2008.&quot; In the fall, ''Vogue Living'' was suspended indefinitely, and ''Men's Vogue'' cut back to two issues a year as an [[outsert]] or supplement to the women's magazine. At the end of the year, December's cover highlighted a disparaging comment [[Jennifer Aniston]] made about [[Angelina Jolie]], to the former's displeasure.

In 2013, [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]] announced she would be taking on the position of artistic director for the company's magazines while remaining at ''Vogue''.

A company spokesman told ''The New York Times'' the position was created to keep Wintour. She described it as &quot;an extension of what I am doing, but on a broader scale.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT artistic director story&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Eric|title=Condé Nast Adds to Job of Longtime Vogue Editor|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/business/media/conde-nast-creates-new-job-for-anna-wintour.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 March 2013|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But since then, &quot;Wintour isn't just redeemed.

She had two children by [[David Shaffer]] following their 1984 marriage: Charles (Charlie) born 1985, and Katherine (known as Bee) born 1987.

===Personal fashion preferences===
Because of her position, Wintour's wardrobe is often closely scrutinised and imitated. Earlier in her career, she mixed fashionable T-shirts and vests with [[designer jeans]]. When she started at ''Vogue'' as creative director she switched to [[Chanel]] suits with miniskirts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer207&quot;/&gt; She continued to wear them during both pregnancies,&lt;ref name=&quot;Acid Queen&quot;/&gt; opening the skirts slightly in back and keeping her jacket on to cover up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer229&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Wintour was listed as &quot;one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s&quot; by the ''Guardian'' in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 50 best-dressed over 50s|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/gallery/2013/mar/29/50-best-dressed-over-50s|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London, UK|first1=Jess|last1=Cartner-Morley|first2=Helen|last2=Mirren|first3=Arianna|last3=Huffington|first4=Valerie|last4=Amos|date=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to biographer [[Jerry Oppenheimer]], her ubiquitous sunglasses are actually corrective lenses, since she suffers from deteriorating vision as her father did.

Now she's having fun again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Gray profile 4&quot;/&gt;

===Politics===
Wintour has been a supporter of the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic Party]] since [[Hillary Clinton]]'s 2000 Senate run and [[John Kerry]]'s 2004 presidential run and serving [[Barack Obama]]'s 2008 and 2012 presidential runs as a &quot;[[Bundler (campaigning)#Bundling|bundler]]&quot; of contributions. In 2008 and 2012, she co-hosted fundraisers with [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], the latter being a 50-person, $40,000-a-plate dinner at Parker's [[West Village]] town house with [[Meryl Streep]], [[Michael Kors]], and Trey Laird, an advertising executive, among the attendees. She has also teamed with [[Calvin Klein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] on fundraisers during Obama's first term and [[Donna Karan]] has been amongst the attendees.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Jeremy W., [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/fashion/for-anna-wintour-power-is-always-in-vogue.html &quot;Power Is Always in Vogue&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 15 June 2012.

She was talking animatedly to a man I presumed to be her boyfriend, although her giant Chanel sunglasses prevented me from being able to tell if she was amused, indifferent or sobbing. The press loved to compare the antics and attitudes of Anna and Miranda, but I found it impossible to believe that anyone could be quite as unbearable as my boss.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; where it is said she and Miranda dislike each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisberger348&quot;&gt;Weisberger, 348. &quot;'Maybe I should try to work for one of her enemies? They'd be happy to hire me, right' &quot;Sure. Send your resume over to Anna Wintour—they've never liked each other very much.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel, Miranda has many similarities to Wintour—among them, she is British, has two children,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisberger38–9&quot;&gt;Weisberger, 38–39. &quot;I had Googled her and was surprised to find Miranda Priestly was born Miriam Princhek in [[East End of London|London's East End]] ...

And luck is probably the only way to explain why I get to sort another person's sweat- and food-stained clothing each morning before eight and arrange to have it cleaned. Oh wait! I think what actually makes me luckiest of all is getting to talk to breeders all over the tristate area for three straight weeks in search of the perfect French bulldog puppy so two incredibly spoiled and unfriendly little girls can each have their own pet.

Priestly has some positive qualities. Andrea notes that she makes all the magazine's key editorial decisions by herself&lt;ref name=Weisberger208&gt;Weisberger, 208. &quot;Miranda was as far as I could tell, a truly fantastic editor.

Although the various fashion editors called in the clothes they wanted to shoot, Miranda alone selected the looks she wanted and which models she wanted wearing each one ... [T]hat made her, in my mind, the main reason for the magazine's stunning success each month. ''Runway'' wouldn't be ''Runway'' — hell, it wouldn't be much of anything at all – without Miranda Priestly.

===Film adaptation===

During the film's production in 2005, Wintour was reportedly threatening prominent fashion personalities, particularly designers, that ''Vogue'' would not cover them if they made cameo appearances in the movie as themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radarmagazine.com/exclusives/2005/11/the-devil-you-know-on-line-one.php |title=The Devil You Know, On Line One|origyear=November 2005|date=30 January 2008|publisher=RadarOnline|accessdate=25 June 2010}}{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She denied it through a spokesperson who said she was interested in anything that &quot;supports fashion.&quot; Many designers are mentioned in the film. Only one, [[Valentino (designer)|Valentino Garavani]], appeared as himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radar&quot; /&gt;

The film was released, in mid-2006, to great commercial success.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxofficemojo&quot;&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=devilwearsprada.htm The Devil Wears Prada] at boxofficemojo.com.

Wintour reportedly said the film would probably go straight to DVD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amiel&quot;/&gt; It made over $300&amp;nbsp;million in worldwide box office receipts. Later in 2006, in an interview with [[Barbara Walters]] that aired the day of the DVD's release, Wintour said she found the film &quot;really entertaining&quot; and praised it for making fashion &quot;entertaining and glamorous and interesting ... I was 100 percent behind it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbara Walters&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Walter|first=Barbara|title=Anna Wintour: Always in Vogue|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2716887&amp;page=3|agency=ABC News|date=12 December 2006|accessdate=18 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That opinion of the movie has not yet led her to forgive Weisberger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer328&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 328.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was reported that the novelist's editor told her to start her third novel over, Wintour's spokesman suggested she &quot;should get a job as someone else's assistant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd Grove&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Grove |first=Lloyd |authorlink=Lloyd Grove |title=Author Goes From 'Prada' To Nada |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/2006/05/02/2006-05-02_author_goes_from__prada__to_.html |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=2 May 2006 |accessdate=24 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614065406/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/2006/05/02/2006-05-02_author_goes_from__prada__to_.html |archivedate=14 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oppenheimer suggests ''The Devil Wears Prada'' may have done Wintour a favour by increasing her name recognition. &quot;Besides giving Weisberger her [[15 minutes of fame|fifteen minutes]],&quot; he says, &quot;[it] ... place[d] Anna squarely in the mainstream celebrity pantheon. [She] was now known and talked about over Big Macs and french fries under the Golden Arches by young [[fashion victim|fashionistas]] in Wal-Mart denim in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]] and [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer328&quot; /&gt;

When ''The September Issue'' was released three years later, critics compared it with the earlier, fictional film. &quot;For the past year or so, she's been on the media warpath to win back her image,&quot; said Paul Schrodt in ''[[Slant Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slant review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Schrodt|first=Paul|title=The September Issue|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=4472|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many considered the question of how similar she was to Streep's Priestly, and praised the film for showing the real person. [[Manohla Dargis]] at ''The New York Times'' said that Priestly had helped humanise Wintour, and &quot;the documentary continues this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dargis SI review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|authorlink=Manohla Dargis|title=The Cameras Zoom In on Fashion's Empress|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/movies/28issue.html?partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes&amp;ei=5083|work=The New York Times|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The movie offers insights that lift it beyond a realist version of ''The Devil Wears Prada,''&quot; agreed Mary Pols in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time SI review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Pols|first=Mary|title=''The September Issue'': Humanizing the Devil|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1918962,00.html|work=Time|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2005, two years after ''The Devil Wears Prada'', Oppenheimer's ''Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue's Editor in Chief'' was published. It painted a similar portrait of the real woman. According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his requests for an interview but discouraged others from talking to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimerxi&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, ''xi''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Wintour is often described as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. &quot;At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public,&quot; wrote ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;What lies beneath&quot; /&gt; &quot;I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional,&quot; Coddington says.&lt;ref name=&quot;60 Minutes 2&quot; /&gt; &quot;I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to,&quot; agrees ''Vogue'' publisher Tom Florio.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSI 11:55&quot;&gt;''The September Issue'', 0:11.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anna Wintour Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|thumb|upright|Wintour at the ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' party for the 2010 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].]]
She has said she admired her father Charles, known as &quot;Chilly Charlie&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Gray profile 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;60 Minutes 3&quot; /&gt; for being &quot;inscrutable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer243&quot; /&gt; Former coworkers told Oppenheimer of a similar aloofness on her part. But she is also known for volatile outbursts of displeasure, and the widely used &quot;Nuclear Wintour&quot; [[wikt:sobriquet|sobriquet]] is a result of both. She dislikes it enough to have asked ''The New York Times'' not to use it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer243&quot; /&gt; &quot;There are times I get quite angry,&quot; she admitted in ''The September Issue''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSI 1:11&quot;&gt;''The September Issue'', 1:11.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;I think she has been very rude to a lot of people in the past, on her way up – very terse,&quot; a friend told the ''Observer''. &quot;She doesn't do small talk.

On one occasion, she has had to pay for her treatment of employees. In 2004, a court ruled that she and Shaffer were to pay $104,403, and Wintour herself an additional $32,639, to settle a lawsuit brought against them by the New York State [[Workers' Compensation]] Board. They had failed to pay the $140,000 judgement it incurred on behalf of a former employee injured on the job, who did not have the necessary insurance coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSG&quot;&gt;Bastone, William; 18 May 2004; [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0518043anna1.html Wintour In $140,000 Worker's Comp Default]; ''The Smoking Gun''.

In the 2000s, her relationship with Bryan was credited with softening her personality at work. &quot;Even when she's in a bad mood, she has a different posture,&quot; someone described as a &quot;Wintour watcher&quot; told the ''[[New York Observer]]''. &quot;The consensus is that she's so much more mellow and easier to work for because she's probably getting laid.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Observer Plum Sykes story&quot; /&gt;

===Pro-fur stance===
She has often been the target of [[animal rights]] organisations like [[PETA]], who are angered by her use of fur in ''Vogue'', her pro-fur editorials and her refusal to run paid advertisements from animal rights organisations. Undeterred, she continues to use fur in photo spreads, saying there's always a way to wear it.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSI 5:33&quot;&gt;''The September Issue'', 0:05.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Nobody was wearing fur until she put it on the cover in the early 1990s,&quot; says Vogue co-worker Tom Florio. &quot;She ignited the entire industry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TSI 9:25&quot;&gt;''The September Issue'', 0:09&lt;/ref&gt;

She has &quot;lost count&quot; of the times she has been physically attacked by activists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lost count&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Fashion Diary: Why She's the No. 1 Target in the Glamour Business|last=Trebay|first=Guy|date=27 February 2006|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E4DE1631F934A15751C0A9609C8B63|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris in October 2005, she was hit with a tofu pie while waiting to get into the [[Chloé]] show.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today&quot;&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Anti-fur demonstrators hit 'Vogue' editor with a pie in Paris|url=

Others outside of the animal-rights community have raised the fur issue.

===Elitism===
Another common criticism of Wintour's editorship focuses on ''Vogue''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s increasing use of celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Acid Queen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Celebrities on cover&quot;&gt;Derrick, Robin; 6 November 2006; [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/in-vogue--for-90-years-423221.html In 'Vogue' for 90 Years]; ''The Independent''.

Likewise, [[Hillary Clinton]] was told not to wear a blue suit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot; /&gt; At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a ''Vogue''-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour is said to have personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Kate Moss]], [[Donald Trump]], and [[Diane von Fürstenberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Acid Queen&quot; /&gt; &quot;I don't think [[Diana Vreeland|Vreeland]] had that kind of concentration,&quot; says ''WWD'' publisher Patrick McCarthy. &quot;She wouldn't have dressed [[Babe Paley]]. Nor would Babe Paley have let her.&quot; By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in ''Vogue'' but more general-interest magazines like ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' and ''[[Us (magazine)|Us]]'', which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. &quot;The end result is that Anna can control it all the way to the selling floor,&quot; says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at [[style.com]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Anna 2&quot; /&gt; She has been credited with killing [[Grunge#Presentation and fashion|grunge fashion]] in the early 1990s, when it wasn't selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for ''Vogue''.

[[File:Anna Wintour 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Wintour (photographed by Ed Kavishe of [http://www.fashionwirepress.com/ Fashion Wire Press]&lt;!-- inline credit is required under the release for this image --&gt;) often insists on being seated apart from other fashion editors at shows.|alt=A seated woman wearing a white dress, holding a coffee cup and sunglasses, looking at the camera. The surrounding seats are empty.]]
Another ''Vogue'' writer has complained Wintour excluded ordinary working women, many of whom are regular subscribers, from the pages. &quot;She's obsessed only about reflecting the aspirations of a certain class of reader,&quot; she says. &quot;We once had a piece about breast cancer which started with an [[flight attendant|airline stewardess]], but she wouldn't have a stewardess in the magazine so we had to go and look for a high-flying businesswoman who'd had cancer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot; /&gt;

Wintour has been accused of setting herself apart even from peers. &quot;I do not think fiction could surpass the reality,&quot; a British fashion magazine editor says of ''The Devil Wears Prada.'' &quot;[A]rt in this instance is only a poor imitation of life.&quot; Wintour, the editor says, routinely requests to be seated out of sight of competing editors at shows. &quot;We spend our working lives telling people which it-bag to carry but Anna is so above the rest of us she does not even have a handbag.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Acid Queen&quot; /&gt;

At the 2008 [[Milan Fashion Week]] she requested that some key shows be rescheduled for earlier in the week so she and other U.S.-based editors could have time to return home before the Paris shows. This led to complaints. Other editors said they had to rush through the earlier shows, and lesser-known designers who had to show later were denied an important audience. [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] said Italian fashion was getting short shrift and Milan was becoming a &quot;circus without sense.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Italian fashion complaints&quot;&gt;Moore, Malcolm; 22 February 2008; &quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/labels/dolcegabbana/3364542/Dolce-and-Gabbana-slams-Milan-Fashion-Week.html Dolce &amp; Gabbana slams Milan Fashion Week]&quot;; ''The Daily Telegraph''. Retrieved 23 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Armani]], who at the time was co-chairing a Met exhibition on [[superhero]]es' costumes with Wintour, drew some attention for his personal remarks. &quot;Maybe what she thinks is a beautiful dress, I wouldn't think was a beautiful dress,&quot; he said. While he claimed he couldn't understand why people disliked her, saying he himself was indifferent, he expressed hope she hadn't made a comment once attributed to her &quot;the Armani era is over.&quot; He accused her of preferring [[French fashion|French]] and American fashion over Italian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armani comments&quot;&gt;Peck, Sally; 21 February 2008; &quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1579440/Giorgio-Armani-attacks-Vogues-Anna-Wintour.html Giorgio Armani attacks Vogue's Anna Wintour]&quot;; ''The Daily Telegraph''.

Her remarks about [[obesity]] have caused controversy on more than one occasion. In 2005, Wintour was heavily criticised by the New York chapter of the [[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]] after ''Vogue'' editor-at-large [[André Leon Talley]] said on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', at one point, Wintour demanded he lose weight. &quot;Most of the ''Vogue'' girls are so thin, tremendously thin&quot; he said, &quot;because Miss Anna doesn't like fat people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review; 19 September 2005; &quot;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_375745.html Vogue fat comment raises group's ire]&quot;; United Press International.

Wintour surprised observers when developing an association with the Kardashian family and Kanye West, which culminated in having the Kardashian-Wests on a Vogue cover; Wintour reportedly commented that having only &quot;deeply tasteful&quot; people in the magazine was boring, and her decision to resort to such personalities has led some to accuse the magazine of being &quot;desperate for buzz.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/3595368/anna-wintour-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-vogue-cover/&lt;/ref&gt;  Wintour has nevertheless continued the association with the less-than-&quot;deeply tasteful&quot; pair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vogue.com/13363097/anna-wintour-kanye-kim-kardashian-west-cfda-vogue-fashion-fund-la-dinner-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
Defences of Wintour have often come from others. Amanda Fortini at ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' said she was comfortable with Wintour's elitism since that was intrinsic to fashion:
{{quote|Most of us read ''Vogue'' not with the intention of buying the wildly expensive clothes, but because doing so educates our eye and hones our taste, similar to the way eating gourmet food refines the [[palate]]. This is a pleasure enabled by Wintour's ruthless aesthetic, her refusal to participate in the democratizing tendency of most of her competitors. To deny her that privilege is to deny her readers the privilege of fantasy in the form of beautifully photographed Paris couture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot; /&gt;}}
[[Emma Brockes]] sees this in Wintour herself: &quot;[Her] unwavering ability to look as if she lives within the pages of her magazine has a sort of honesty to it, proof that, whatever one thinks about it, the lifestyle peddled by Vogue is at least physically possible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;What lies beneath&quot;/&gt;
&quot;Print publications have to be as luxurious an experience as possible,&quot; Wintour explained in 2015. &quot;You have to feel it coming off the page. You have to see photographs and pieces that you couldn't possibly see anywhere else.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2015 New York interview&quot; /&gt;

Some friends see her purported coldness as just traditional British reserve,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amiel Maclean's&quot; /&gt; or shyness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Gray profile 2&quot; /&gt; Brockes says it may be mutual, &quot;partly a reflection of how awkward people are with her, particularly women, who get preemptively chippy when faced with the prospect of meeting Fashion Incarnate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;What lies beneath&quot;&gt;Brockes, Emma; 27 May 2006; &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/may/27/pressandpublishing.fashion What lies beneath]&quot;; ''The Guardian''.

{{quote|I have so many people here, Morley, that have worked with me for 15, 20 years, and, you know, if I'm such a bitch, they must really be a glutton for punishment because they're still here ...  If one comes across sometimes as being cold or brusque, it's simply because I'm striving for the best.&lt;ref name=&quot;60 Minutes 2&quot; /&gt;}}
She has made similar statements in defence of her reported refusal to hire fat people. &quot;It's important to me that the people that are working here, particularly in the fashion department,&quot; she says, &quot;will present themselves in a way that makes sense to the outside world that they work at ''Vogue.''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Gray profile 2&quot; /&gt;

Her defenders have called criticism [[sexism|sexist]]. &quot;Powerful women in the media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts,&quot; said ''The New York Times'' in a piece about Wintour shortly after ''The Devil Wears Prada''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Wintour film piece&quot;&gt;Carr, David; 10 July 2006; &quot;[http://plainsfeminist.blogspot.com/2006/07/devil-you-say.html The Devil Wears Teflon]&quot;; ''The New York Times'', retrieved from plainsfeminist.blogspot.com 10 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; When she took over at ''Vogue'', gossip columnist [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] reported rumours she had gotten the job through an affair with [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.|Si Newhouse]]. A reportedly furious Wintour made her anger the subject of one of her first staff meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot; /&gt; She still complained about it when accepting a media award in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oppenheimer286&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been called a feminist whose changes to ''Vogue'' have reflected, acknowledged, and reinforced advances in the status of women. Reviewing Oppenheimer's book in ''[[The Washington Monthly]]'', [[managing editor]] Christina Larson notes ''Vogue'', unlike many other women's magazines,{{quote|...doesn't play to its readership's sense of inadequacy ... Instead, it reminds women to take satisfaction, parading all manner of fineries (clothes, furniture, travel destinations) that a successful woman might buy, or at least admire. While it surely exists to sell ads ... it does so primarily by exploiting ambition, not insecurity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot; /&gt;}}
Wintour, unlike Vreeland, &quot;...shifted ''Vogue''{{'}}s focus from the cult of beauty to the cult of the creation of beauty.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot; /&gt; To her, the focus on celebrities is a welcome development as it means women are making the cover of ''Vogue'' at least in part for what they have accomplished, not just how they look.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot; /&gt;

Complaints about her role as fashion ''[[eminence grise]]'' are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. &quot;She's honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no,&quot; according to [[Karl Lagerfeld]]. &quot;She's not too pushy&quot; agrees [[François-Henri Pinault]], chief executive officer of [[PPR (company)|PPR]], [[Gucci]]'s parent company. &quot;She lets you know it's not a problem if you can't do something she wants.&quot; Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let [[Tom Ford]] go. Designers such as [[Alice Roi]] and [[Isabel Toledo]] have flourished without indulging Wintour or ''Vogue''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Anna 2&quot; /&gt; Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep ''Vogue'' independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an [[Giorgio Armani S.p.A.|Armani]] ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages,&lt;ref name=&quot;Acid Queen&quot; /&gt; although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time. &quot;Commercial is not a dirty word to me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Gray profile 4&quot; /&gt;

Wintour herself, when asked about it, dismisses the notion that she has all the power attributed to her. &quot;I don't think of myself as a powerful person,&quot; she told ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world's hundred most powerful women. &quot;You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to help others, and for that I'm extremely grateful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes power interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Goudreau|first=Jenna|title=Vogue's Anna Wintour: Intimidating, No. Powerful, Yes.|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2011/08/24/vogue-anna-wintour-intimidating-powerful-forbes-power-women-fashion/|newspaper=Forbes|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticisms like Beene's, she has defended the democratisation of what were once exclusive luxury brands. &quot;It means more people are going to get better fashion,&quot; she told [[Dana Thomas]]. &quot;And the more people who can have fashion, the better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dana Thomas book&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster |last=Thomas |first=Dana |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Press |isbn=978-1-59420-129-5 |page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;
