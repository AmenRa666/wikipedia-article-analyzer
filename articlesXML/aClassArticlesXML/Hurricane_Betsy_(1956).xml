'''Hurricane Betsy''' in 1956 was the first [[North Atlantic hurricane]] to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in Puerto Rico in 24&amp;nbsp;years. The third [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1956 Atlantic hurricane season]], Betsy developed from a [[tropical wave]] on August&amp;nbsp;9 to the east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It rapidly developed into a 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h) major hurricane before striking [[Guadeloupe]]. There, Betsy heavily damaged 1000&amp;nbsp;houses and left severe crop destruction, and there were 18&amp;nbsp;deaths in the territory. As Betsy continued into the northeastern Caribbean, it capsized a ship, killing its crew of two.

On August&amp;nbsp;12, Betsy struck southeastern Puerto Rico and quickly crossed the island. Damage was heaviest where it moved ashore and in the territory's central portion, and throughout Puerto Rico there were 15,023&amp;nbsp;houses that were destroyed by Betsy. Multiple locations reported heavy crop damage, including Camuy which reported a complete loss of the corn crop. Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to be observed from the [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] radar, and also resulted in the first [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane warning]] on the island to be released on television. The hurricane left $40&amp;nbsp;million in damage and 16&amp;nbsp;deaths, which prompted a federally declared disaster area. Locally the hurricane was known as the Santa Clara Hurricane. After exiting Puerto Rico, Betsy brushed the Bahamas before turning northeastward, becoming [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] on August&amp;nbsp;18. The remnants dissipated two days later to the south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Betsy 1956 track.png}}
Before Betsy's formation, the northeastward shift of the [[Azores High]] allowed for an increase in [[atmospheric instability]] across the tropical Atlantic, which made conditions for [[tropical cyclogenesis]] more favorable in early August.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; A [[tropical wave]] exited the west coast of Africa on August&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;ref name=&quot;perez&quot;/&gt; On August&amp;nbsp;9, a ship reported rough seas and winds of force&amp;nbsp;10 on the [[Beaufort scale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gordon E.

The flight reported how small the hurricane was, including a {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide [[eye (cyclone)|eye]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; After maintaining that intensity for about 24&amp;nbsp;hours, Betsy began weakening,{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} moving directly over [[Marie-Galante]] and southern [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; It entered the eastern Caribbean with winds of 90&amp;nbsp;mph (150&amp;nbsp;km/h) before it began a track to the west-northwest.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

On August&amp;nbsp;12, Hurricane Betsy passed about {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Saint Croix]] before striking southeastern [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; This made Betsy the first hurricane to strike the island since the [[1932 San Ciprian hurricane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=José A.

By that time, the storm had increased in size; the Hurricane Hunters reported that the gale force winds extended {{convert|125|mi|km|abbr=on}} to its north. The eye reformed on August&amp;nbsp;14, becoming well-organized and attaining a minimum [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|960|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. The next day, Betsy turned to the northeast due to an approaching [[trough (meteorology)|trough]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; Despite beginning a weakening trend, the pressure dropped further to {{convert|954|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} on August&amp;nbsp;17.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} The eye became increasingly poorly defined,&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; and Betsy weakened to a tropical storm on August&amp;nbsp;18 to the south of [[Nova Scotia]]. Turning to the east, it became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] later that day, eventually dissipating on August&amp;nbsp;20.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

==Impact==
[[File:Betsy 1956 rainfall.gif|right|thumb|Rainfall summary of Hurricane Betsy in Puerto Rico]]
When the first advisory was issued on Betsy, a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] was issued from Barbados to [[Antigua]]. Around that time, a hurricane watch was also issued for Puerto Rico and the [[United States Virgin Islands]], which was later upgraded to a hurricane warning.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; This was the first hurricane warning in Puerto Rico to be aired on television.&lt;ref name=&quot;perez&quot;&gt;{{cite web|page=30&amp;ndash;31|date=September 2002|title=Notes on the Tropical Cyclones of Puerto Rico, 1508-1970|author=Orlando Férez|accessdate=2011-10-15|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/data_sub/perez_21_34.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hurricane struck Guadeloupe with winds from 100&amp;ndash;120&amp;nbsp;mph (160&amp;ndash;195&amp;nbsp;km/h), which caused extensive damage to 1,000&amp;nbsp;houses. The communications throughout the territory were disrupted. The high winds destroyed upwards of 60% of the banana, breadfruit, coconut, and papaya crop, which severely impacted the economy. Across the [[French West Indies]], the hurricane resulted in 18&amp;nbsp;deaths and caused $10&amp;nbsp;million in damage, $3.5&amp;nbsp;million of which from crop damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; In nearby [[Dominica]], winds reached {{convert|69|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;perez&quot;/&gt; In Saint Croix, the hurricane dropped {{convert|3.20|in|mm|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;pr&quot;/&gt; while winds reached {{convert|86|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;perez&quot;/&gt; In the northeastern Caribbean, Betsy capsized a ship and killed its crew of two. Another ship in the region drifted for several days south of Saint Croix due to a damaged engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;wn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Weather Notes: Betsy's Roving Eye|date=August 1956|pages=311&amp;ndash;312|accessdate=2011-10-15|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/084/mwr-084-08-0311.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Betsy crossed Puerto Rico, it produced hurricane force winds across the entire territory except in the southwest corner. Sustained winds reached {{convert|73|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], and [[Ramey Air Force Base]] on the island's northwestern portion recorded {{convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gusts.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; The high winds downed a significant number of trees in the island's interior due to the funneling within valleys. In [[Aibonito, Puerto Rico|Aibonito]], the winds destroyed 1000&amp;nbsp;houses and damaged another 500, and in nearby [[Comerío, Puerto Rico|Comerío]] the winds severely damaged or destroyed 1285&amp;nbsp;dwellings. In [[Jayuya, Puerto Rico|Jayuya]] in the central portion of the island, the hurricane left severe crop damage, including a complete loss to the banana crop. However, damage was heaviest in [[Yabucoa, Puerto Rico|Yabucoa]] near where Betsy moved ashore,&lt;ref name=&quot;wn&quot;/&gt; due to a slight oscillation of the eye. High winds caused severe damage in a 20&amp;nbsp;mi (32&amp;nbsp;km) radius.&lt;ref name=&quot;perez&quot;/&gt; In Yabucoa, over 12,000&amp;nbsp;people were left homeless, and damage totaled $8&amp;nbsp;million. Damage was likewise severe where Betsy moved offshore in Camuy, with a complete loss to the corn crop, 95% of the avocado, 65% of breadfruit, and 50% of the coffee crop ruined.&lt;ref name=&quot;wn&quot;/&gt; The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in the central portion of the island,&lt;ref name=&quot;pr&quot;/&gt; with a peak 24‑hour total of {{convert|8.72|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Río Grande, Puerto Rico|Río Grande]].&lt;ref name=&quot;perez&quot;/&gt; The same station recorded a total of {{convert|9.07|in|mm|abbr=on}}, which was the highest total related to Betsy's passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Roth|date=2008-09-28|title=Hurricane Betsy - August 11-13, 1956|accessdate=2011-10-15|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/betsy1956.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across Puerto Rico, Betsy destroyed 15,023&amp;nbsp;houses and left $40&amp;nbsp;million in damage. There were sixteen deaths on the island,&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; which was less than expected due to well-heeded warnings.&lt;ref name=&quot;wn&quot;/&gt; There were also 24&amp;nbsp;injuries in the territory related to the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;pres&quot;&gt;{{Cite conference  | first = Frank  | last = Mújica-Baker   | title = Huracanes y Tormentas que han afectadi a Puerto Rico | publisher = Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, Agencia Estatal para el manejo de Emergencias y Administracion de Desastres | url = http://www.gobierno.pr/NR/rdonlyres/49EA64D0-305B-4881-8B85-04B518004BD5/0/Ciclones_en_PR.pdf | pages = 14 | accessdate = 2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betsy was the first hurricane on record to be observed from the San Juan radar.&lt;ref name=&quot;pr&quot;/&gt; On the island, it is known as the Santa Clara hurricane.&lt;ref name=&quot;perez&quot;/&gt; Due to the damage, U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] declared Puerto Rico as a disaster area on August&amp;nbsp;18, which allocated millions of dollars in assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;pres&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2004-12-08|title=Puerto Rico Hurricane|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|accessdate=2011-10-15|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/event.fema?id=1263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Puerto Rican governor allocated $6.7&amp;nbsp;million of funding to aid in rebuilding.&lt;ref name=&quot;pres&quot;/&gt;

In San Salvador in the Bahamas, the hurricane produced wind gusts of {{convert|132|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and sustained winds reached 100&amp;nbsp;mph (160&amp;nbsp;km/h). The strm dropped about {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall. Betsy destroyed several houses and wrecked the roofs of several churches. Hurricane Betsy left about $380,000 in damage in the Bahamas.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; While delivering relief supplies to San Salvador Air Force Base, a [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|Douglas C-124A-DL Globemaster II]] operated by the U.S. Air Force crashed. The plane had a right landing gear fail and as the result the plane skidded down the runway and came to a stop. One person was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2003-10-02|title=Accident description|accessdate=2011-10-15|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19650816-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to uncertainty in the storm's movement, officials issued a hurricane warning for southern Florida. Although Betsy remained far away from the state, its eye was observed on radar in Miami at a potentially record distance of {{convert|337|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Grand Banks]] offshore Canada, the hurricane sunk a ship, although the entire crew was rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Canadian Hurricane Centre|date=2010-11-09|title=1956-Betsy|accessdate=2011-10-14|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=E80F433C-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
