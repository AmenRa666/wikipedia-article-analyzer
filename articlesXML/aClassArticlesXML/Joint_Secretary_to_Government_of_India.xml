==History==
The post of Joint Secretary in Government of India was created in 1920s. In 1937, the [[Secretariat Building, New Delhi|Central Secretariat]] contained only 7 Joint Secretaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maheshwari 2001 666&quot; /&gt; However, until 1946, there were only 25 Joint Secretaries in Government of India.

According to [[A. D. Gorwala]], [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|ICS]] &quot;The Joint Secretaries ought to in reality be what the name implies, namely secretaries for the subject entrusted to them and joined to a more senior secretary for the convenience of administrative work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Tottenham&quot; /&gt;

Sir Richard Tottenham, [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|ICS]] had once expressed &quot;In my opinion there is, or should be, no distinction of function, but only of pay between a Joint and a Additional Secretary. Additional and Joint Secretaries should not be either cheap Secretaries or expensive Deputy Secretaries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Tottenham&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jayapalan|first=n.|title=Indian Administration 2 Vols. Set|year=2001|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distri|location=|isbn=9788171569212|pages=668|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
