The '''1846 Havana hurricane''' (also known as the '''Great Havana hurricane of 1846''' and '''San Francisco de Borja hurricane''') was the most intense [[tropical cyclone]] in recorded history for 78&amp;nbsp;years and the first known [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale|Category&amp;nbsp;5-strength hurricane]] to strike [[Cuba]]. The first indications of the formation of a disturbance were first noted on 5&amp;nbsp;October in the [[Caribbean Sea]], but little else was known until the storm approached Cuba on 10&amp;nbsp;October. There, it brought extreme winds and the lowest known [[atmospheric pressure]] of the time – 938&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (27.70&amp;nbsp;[[inch of mercury|inHg]]) – a record which remained unbroken until the development of [[1924 Cuba hurricane|a later cyclone in 1924]]. It soon curved toward [[Florida]], where it maintained its intensity, continuing to rapidly hasten northward along the [[East Coast of the United States]] to [[New England]]. It entered an [[extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical transition]] while situated over [[New York (state)|New York]] on 13&amp;nbsp;October, producing intense Category&amp;nbsp;2-force winds and unusually little precipitation. Eventually, the gale dissipated over [[the Maritimes|the Canadian Maritimes]] the following day as a markedly weaker storm.

In Cuba, the storm caused hundreds of deaths, capsized dozens of ships, obliterated buildings, uprooted trees, and ruined crops. Many towns were wholly destroyed or flattened and never recovered, while others disappeared entirely. Damage in the [[United States]] was considerably better-chronicled despite being less severe. In [[Key West]], widespread destruction was noted, with 40&amp;nbsp;deaths, many vessels rendered unfit, and widespread structural damage, with several buildings swept off of their foundations and hundreds of others flattened. Few supplies arrived in the following days and relief efforts were gradual, with few resources within the town's vicinity. Along other sections of the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern U.S. coast]], copious rainfall and moderate winds impacted agriculture, shipping, and residences. As the storm tracked along the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Middle-Atlantic coast]], similar effects were reported: there, the gale inundated many areas, impeded communications, destroyed railroads and canals, and flattened structures. Despite extensive damage, only two deaths were recorded outside Cuba and Florida. Along its entire track, the hurricane caused $338,000 in losses and at least 164&amp;nbsp;deaths.{{#tag:ref|All damage figures are in 1846&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollars|United States dollars (USD)]].|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}{{#tag:ref|A concrete death total cannot be established due to the hurricane's historical nature; the figure used is one from a modern study,&lt;ref name=&quot;DATCs&quot;/&gt; though unofficial sources indicate significantly higher totals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tannehill1938-156&quot;/&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

Unusual in many aspects, the 1846&amp;nbsp;Havana hurricane was the most intense of its time. Though [[atmospheric pressure]] readings in Cuba reached as low as 916&amp;nbsp;mbar (27.06&amp;nbsp;inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938&amp;nbsp;mbar (27.70&amp;nbsp;inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded pressure measurement until [[1924 Cuba hurricane|1924]], 78&amp;nbsp;years later. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category&amp;nbsp;5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba at such an intensity. As a result of the tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas. [[Sand Key Light|Sand Key]], which completely submerged during the course of the hurricane, wholly re-emerged by December of that year, albeit not in its original position; meanwhile, ecological damage remained evident for decades in Key West.

The hurricane's origins can be traced to the central [[Caribbean Sea]] on 5&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chenoweth2006-234&quot;&gt;Chenoweth 2006, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, its passage south of [[Jamaica]] was observed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tannehill1938-156&quot;&gt;Tannehill 1938, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; and soon later, the hurricane transited across the [[Cayman Islands]], producing relatively high winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-3&quot;/&gt; During the late evening of 10&amp;nbsp;October, winds began to increase on the island of [[Cuba]], culminating the following morning; while the strongest winds were originally in the storm's northeastern sector, they were later noted in its northwest. Its [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] presumably passed slightly east of [[Havana]] while maintaining an [[atmospheric pressure]] of 916&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (27.06&amp;nbsp;[[inch of mercury|inHg]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-151&quot;&gt;Ludlum 1963, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; This was accompanied by Category&amp;nbsp;5-force winds on the modern-day [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Landsea2012-883&quot;&gt;Landsea et al. 2012, p. 883&lt;/ref&gt; defined as 1-minute [[maximum sustained wind]]s of at least 157&amp;nbsp;mph (252&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;!-- NOTE: Infobox is rounded up to nearest five per standards --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SSHWS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Schott, Timothy|author2=Landsea, Christopher|author3=Hafele, Gene|author4=Lorens, Jeffrey|author5=Taylor, Arthur|author6=Thurm, Harvey|author7=Ward, Bill|author8=Willis, Mark|author9=Zaleski, Walt|title=The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/sshws.pdf|work=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=29 December 2013|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the reading, a 1993&amp;nbsp;analysis by weather historian José Fernández-Partagás calculated a corrected sea-level pressure at 938&amp;nbsp;mbar (27.70&amp;nbsp;inHg); even so, the value maintained the hurricane as the most intense in recorded history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partagás1993-1&quot;&gt;Partagás 1993, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It arrived at [[Key West]] the morning of 11&amp;nbsp;October, soon after its departure from Cuba, with undiminished intensity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-151&quot;/&gt; The storm gradually meandered toward [[Tampa Bay]], and eventually arrived on that afternoon of 11&amp;nbsp;October, its effects persisting through the following morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-152&quot;&gt;Ludlum 1963, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Winds, which initially swept northeasterly at [[Beaufort scale|force&amp;nbsp;4]] during the early evening, veered toward the southeast and peaked at force&amp;nbsp;8 the following morning. Weather historian [[David M. Ludlum|David Ludlum]] tracked the hurricane's path past [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Key]], noting the disturbance's northeastward curve as it neared [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-153&quot;&gt;Ludlum 1963, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Advancing northward over land, the once-powerful hurricane weakened, with somewhat higher atmospheric pressures and winds of less severity reported at [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Paralleling the coast while situated inland, it hastened quickly toward the north, swiftly passing through [[North Carolina]] and arriving in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region by 13&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-153&quot;/&gt; Southeasterly gusts persisted as the storm continued its northerly progression inland along the course of the [[East Coast of the United States]]. After reaching [[Washington, D.C.]], in the early morning, it arrived near [[New York City]] by sunrise, and transited across [[Boston]] during the afternoon of 13&amp;nbsp;October. The storm likely underwent an [[extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|extratropical transition]] by the time it arrived in [[New York (state)|New York]] state, elongating linearly east-to-west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-94&quot;&gt;Ludlum 1963, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The gale's winds swept toward the southeast with a brief hiatus in the early evening. As it neared [[New England]], it produced little precipitation yet intense gusts, which peaked at force&amp;nbsp;9-strength in the vicinity of [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-95&quot;&gt;Ludlum 1963, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclone's diameter over New England, at its largest point, reached {{convert|200|km|mi|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, accompanied by Category&amp;nbsp;2-force winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boose2001-40&quot;&gt;Boose et al. 2001, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The system was last sighted on the morning of 14&amp;nbsp;October, rapidly weakening as it meandered into [[the Maritimes|the Canadian Maritimes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boose2001-HTD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Boose|title=Hurricane Track Data|url=http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/data/p01/hf011/hf011-03-tracks.csv|work=Harvard University|publisher=Harvard Forest|accessdate=29 December 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
In [[Cuba]], the hurricane's impact was extremely severe: the storm destroyed nearly a hundred ships and likely killed hundreds of individuals across the island,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tannehill1938-156&quot;/&gt; and also inflicted extensive crop damage and widespread flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-69&quot;/&gt; The hurricane capsized nearly all crafts docked at [[Havana Harbor]], and of the 104&amp;nbsp;boats in the harbor prior to the storm's arrival, only 12&amp;nbsp;remained after it subsided. Between 40&amp;nbsp;and 50&amp;nbsp;other cargo vessels were impaired, with significant structural damage in the city proper also observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-151&quot;/&gt; Damage to houses, crops, and shipping was catastrophic throughout the island; the storm was reportedly the worst in Cuban history at the time,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz2007-16&quot;&gt;Schwartz 2007, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; more severe even than an earlier hurricane in 1844.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tannehill1938-156&quot;/&gt; Waves were high enough to reach the lanterns of the [[Morro Castle (fortress)|Morro Castle]] lighthouse. While no concrete death toll was established, reports indicated the deaths of several dozen individuals during the entire course of the storm,&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-3&quot;&gt;Malcolm 2010, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; while other records noted that hundreds of deaths had possibly occurred across the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tannehill1938-156&quot;/&gt;

Damage in the [[United States]], however, was better-documented. There, the disturbance washed away the island of [[Sand Key Light|Sand Key]] and resulted in the loss of many vessels in nearby [[Key West]] harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-152&quot;/&gt; Its [[storm surge]] scattered debris throughout the city and swept many structures afloat upon high waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-8&quot;/&gt; In all, approximately $200,000 in damage and 40&amp;nbsp;deaths were reported,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-152&quot;/&gt; representing four percent of the town's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-14&quot;/&gt; Elsewhere in the state, damage remained severe, with abnormal storm tides and widespread property destruction noted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-153&quot;/&gt; Shipping and agriculture took the brunt of the storm's impact in other southeastern states;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2009-119&quot;/&gt; there, it produced damage similar to that inflicted by an earlier 1824 hurricane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-153&quot;/&gt; Even farther north along the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Middle-Atlantic coast]], copious rainfall and intense gusts were observed, especially in the [[New England]] region. Winds uprooted trees, cracked canals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-95&quot;/&gt; damaged railroads, and demolished factories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boose2001-HRD&quot;/&gt; Rainfall totals, however, were generally low, indicative of a dry gale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-95&quot;/&gt; In all, the hurricane caused at least 164&amp;nbsp;deaths and $338,000 (1846&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage throughout its path,{{#tag:ref|Damage totals as follows: [[Fort Zachary Taylor]] endured $200,000 in damage at [[Key West]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-10&quot;/&gt; the $16,000 vessel ''Exchange'' was capsized, the $10,000 boat ''Commissary'' was sunk, the $45,000 ship ''Iris'' was grounded, the $22,000 craft ''Eben Preble'' was beached,&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer1998-72&quot;&gt;Singer 1998, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; the $5,000 vessel ''La Reunion'' was driven ashore, the $20,000 ship ''Villanueva'' was run aground, and the $20,000 boat ''Navigator'' was beached.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer1998-73&quot;&gt;Singer 1998, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} although some reports indicated hundreds of additional deaths across the island of Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tannehill1938-156&quot;/&gt;

=== Caribbean Sea ===

Early in its development, the hurricane passed near the [[Cayman Islands]], inundating all of [[Grand Cayman]], with its worst effects concentrated at the localities of Savannah and Newlands, both under a {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[storm surge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-3&quot;/&gt; Although residential damage was minimal, many grasslands were destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams1992-73&quot;&gt;Williams 1992, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrations coinciding with the birthday of [[Isabella II of Spain]] held in [[Havana|Havana, Cuba]], on 10&amp;nbsp;October were disrupted by heavy rains and strong winds, indicative of the hurricane's imminent arrival that evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-67&quot;&gt;Pérez 2001, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Following the storm's [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], the most severe damage as a result of the storm was observed from eastern regions of [[Pinar del Río Province|Pinar del Río]] to western [[Matanzas]]. Already soaked by weeks of constant rainfall, with swollen rivers, inundated roads, and spoiled tobacco crops,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-69&quot;&gt;Pérez 2001, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; existing problems were only further exacerbated; at [[Paso Real de San Diego]], [[cassava]], [[sweet potato]], and other [[vianda]] harvests were ruined. In Havana proper, {{convert|30|ft|m}} waves battered ships seeking refuge in [[Havana Harbor|the city's harbor]], grounded, driven away, capsized, and smashed, with much of their cargo, composing of cartons of sugar, bales of tobacco, and fragments of hemp, barrels, and cases strewn along the shore and sea. In all, the gale destroyed or seriously damaged 105&amp;nbsp;commercial ships, 70&amp;nbsp;sloops, pilot boats, and military craft, as well as 111&amp;nbsp;other vessels at sea;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-70&quot;&gt;Pérez 2001, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; as a result, shortages of many essential goods occurred in inland provinces. Damage in Cuban port cities was only further aggravated by the amount of debris produced by the destruction of ships, warehouses, and docks, which were in turn blown into harborside structures by powerful gusts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-71&quot;&gt;Pérez 2001, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Masonry buildings bore the brunt of the storm, with the recently overhauled Teatro Principal wholly obliterated,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-71&quot;/&gt; the city gas plant rendered unusable after its smokestack crumpled, and numerous churches flattened. [[Havana Cathedral]] experienced considerable damage to its roof, while the Montserrat Church was completely unroofed. The hurricane destroyed [[parish church]]es at [[Jesus del Monte, Cuba|Jesus del Monte]] and [[Guanabacoa]], while several hospitals, including the Real Hospital de San Lázaro, were also demolished, with its entrance wrecked, several wards and its infirmary building damaged, and its roofs crippled. Damage was so severe that some believed that the destruction was wrought by an earthquake. Residential damage was omnipresent, with 1,275 houses razed to the ground and another 1,040 damaged in Guanabacoa alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-72&quot;&gt;Pérez 2001, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The storm covered streets with planks, tiles, and other debris, uprooted and defoliated palm trees, ruined gardens, and damaged balconies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-73&quot;&gt;Pérez 2001, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The massive [[storm surge]] associated with the system annihilated and washed away most of  the huts and houses of [[Batabanó, Cuba|Batabanó]], with only 20&amp;nbsp;left standing. Food and water supplies were lost, while the retreating tides left behind inches of mud and mounds of debris in their wake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-74&quot;&gt;Pérez 2001, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Caimito, Cuba|Caimito]] and [[Rosario, Cuba|Rosario]], warehouses, their contents, piers, and wharves were all driven out into the neighboring ocean, and both towns were entirely flattened. The hurricane destroyed all the piers and nearly every building in [[Cabañas, Cuba|Cabañas]], and of the 23&amp;nbsp;houses built in [[Cojimar]], only seven weathered the storm. A majority of ships at Matanzas were destroyed, with numerous ships capsized or washed aground. Massive waves crashed ashore, crushing buildings and inundating low-lying areas in the city. Many wooden and stone buildings, already impaired by an earlier hurricane in 1844, were immediately destroyed by the surge's impact. Structures along the shoreline, in addition to towns along the courses of the [[Yumurí River|Yumurí]] and [[San Juan River (Cuba)|San Juan]] rivers, were driven out to sea. More than forty deaths occurred in the first round of flooding brought by the storm. At [[Güines]], the tempest wrecked all of the town's residences, public buildings, and businesses, and over a hundred individuals died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-74&quot;/&gt; Among the losses were two distilleries, a packing plant, a lumbermill, and a warehouse, and countless other buildings, while at Pinar del Río, flooding along mountainsides and nearby rivers swamped the city and other nearby communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-75&quot;&gt;Pérez 2001, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Havana, Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The Morro Castle lighthouse|alt=A black-and-white image of a lighthouse]]

Not a single residence remained undamaged after the hurricane's passage in [[Bejucal]], [[San Antonio de los Baños]], [[Santiago de Las Vegas]], and [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]], and those that were not destroyed were unroofed. [[Nueva Paz]] suffered the loss of 110&amp;nbsp;homes, while [[Madruga]] lost 100; only five remained standing at [[Managua]], and of the eight left at [[Quivicán]], all were severely damaged. At [[Jibacoa]], only 32&amp;nbsp;of the town's 82&amp;nbsp;residences survived the storm. The seaside town of [[Guanabo]] was entirely lost, with floodwaters driving the town to sea and leaving its residents homeless. The hamlets of Mantilla, La Chorrera, and Paula disappeared entirely, while [[Candelaria, Cuba|Candelaria]] was washed away with the loss of all its structures, of which a majority collapsed under the strength of the storm's powerful winds before being driven out to sea. Most structures in [[Cayajabos, Cuba|Cayajabos]], [[Boyeros]], and [[Aguacate, Cuba|Aguacate]] were flattened, while the villages of [[Alquízar]], [[Güira de Melena]], and Vereda Nueva essentially vanished after the storm passed through. Guatao was entirely destroyed, suffering the loss of its apparently indestructible church, while Quemado wholly vanished and only four houses endured the storm's impacts at San Antonio de los Baños.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pérez2001-75&quot;/&gt;

=== Southeastern United States ===
[[File:1846 hurricane Key West, Florida map.png|thumb|right|300px|Map depicting the extent of the hurricane's damage in Key West.|alt=A sketch detailing damage caused by the 1846 hurricane.]]
The impacts of the hurricane were extreme throughout the state of [[Florida]], especially in the [[Florida Keys]]. High winds washed away two lighthouses near [[Key West]], resulting in the deaths of all 16&amp;nbsp;people at [[Sand Key Light]] and 14&amp;nbsp;individuals at the [[Key West lighthouse]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-152&quot;/&gt; although keeper [[Barbara Mabrity]] survived, seven of her children died while taking refuge there during the hurricane.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeWire1995-124&quot;&gt;De Wire 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}}-[[storm surge]] in Key West proper swept through downtown and forced many to abandon their homes; many attempted to flee to higher ground but were still killed or injured. All wharves and warehouses in the town suffered some degree of damage, and of the approximately six hundred residences on the key, only six endured the storm's fury successfully, with the others unroofed or flattened by intense winds. [[Fort Zachary Taylor]], partially obliterated by the hurricane, endured over $200,000 in damage, while the nearby customs-house was also harmed. Uprooted trees and debris from destroyed houses rendered roads impassable. The storm also changed the landscape within the vicinity, washing away Sand Key entirety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-152&quot;/&gt; However, the island quickly resurfaced by that December, albeit {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} west of its original position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-10&quot;&gt;Malcolm 2010, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Every vessel at local harbor sustained serious damage; in addition, some 20&amp;nbsp;vessels were unaccounted for, and at least 40&amp;nbsp;deaths were documented,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-152&quot;/&gt; though another source suggested 50&amp;nbsp;lives were lost out at sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes2007-60&quot;&gt;Barnes 2007, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; An additional twelve died inland as a result death by being impaled, crushed, or drowned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-9&quot;&gt;Malcolm 2010, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Powerful winds and the storm's massive flood tide washed lumber and casks aboard ships. Massive pieces of timber, hurled across town, cracked walls and inflicted significant damage. Floodwaters {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep submerged already debris-clogged streets, with inundation as deep as {{convert|7.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the key's northeastern sector. There, the Lafayette Salt Company was swept away along with two military cemeteries. Floodwaters exhumed many skeletons and coffins in those graveyards, dispersing them across local forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes2007-60&quot;/&gt; In downtown, both the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] and [[Methodism|Methodist]] chapels collapsed, and warehouses were moderately damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-9&quot;/&gt; The town's new stone marine hospital, struck by the remnants of a wharf and a large raft, was nearly completely destroyed by the storm's intense winds. Lumber, crowbars, and cannon carriages from the construction site of Fort Zachary Taylor were scattered throughout the streets. High waters floated a camp stable {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} from its initial location, floating its horses and mules to safety. Four drowning deaths were chronicled at the fort, all having been swept away from the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-8&quot;&gt;Malcolm 2010, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Several wooden buildings along the shoreline, not tethered to the ground, drifted out to sea upon high waters due to the sheer force of the hurricane's gusts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-14&quot;&gt;Malcolm 2010, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable maritime losses were also noted nearby, with the deaths of three on the ''Lafayette'', which capsized offshore, one fatality each upon the ''Exchange'' and ''Frankford'', and 19&amp;nbsp;casualties on the ''Villa Nueva''; in addition, several other abandoned vessels were driven aground, apparently without any loss of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-9&quot;/&gt;

The storm's path of devastation extended northward through the state. In [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee County]], a plantation owner and his horse drowned attempting to cross the elevated waters of the [[Little Manatee River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes2007-60&quot;/&gt; To the north at [[Fort Brooke]], high winds felled several oak trees on the grounds of a local military installation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-152&quot;/&gt; wholly uprooting several others. Along [[Tampa Bay]], winds obliterated several houses and flattened fences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-153&quot;/&gt; To the northeast at [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], the storm was more severe, with the hurricane's winds having been &quot;beyond anything in the recollection of&amp;nbsp;... the oldest inhabitant [of the town].&quot; Storm tides exceeded the previously recorded [[high water mark]] by {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}, inundating numerous wharves and businesses along the path of Bay Street. By the time the storm's fury abated, the storm tossed wharves out to sea, wrecked structures along the [[St. Johns River]], and rendered nearby saw mills' lumber worthless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-153&quot;/&gt;

Even along other, farther north, portions of the southeastern coast, the gale remained intense. At [[Savannah, Georgia]], one fatality occurred at sea, and damage to fences, roofs, and trees was minor despite high winds,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-153&quot;/&gt; with debris from the remnants of [[melia azedarach|chinaberry trees]] littering the streets of the city. A schooner capsized at Union Wharf, and farther down the coast at [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Tybee Island]], another craft was washed aground. Within the vicinity of [[Darien, Georgia]], the gale's high tides swamped rice fields, also impeding the impending harvest along the [[Savannah River]] in [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2009-119&quot;&gt;Fraser 2009, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Although little rain fell farther north at [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], with merely {{convert|2.03|in|cm|abbr=on}} measured, gusts leveled wharves, uprooted trees, prostrated fences, and unroofed buildings. Despite copious rainfall measurements at [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], which received {{convert|4.50|in|cm|abbr=on}} of rainfall, damage was minimal and, for the most part, restricted to crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-153&quot;/&gt; The vessel ''Mutual Safety'' departed Charleston in the mid-afternoon of 10&amp;nbsp;October,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2009-118&quot;&gt;Fraser 2009, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; but soon encountered the storm and experienced severe damage. In an effort to save the vessel's passengers, it was deliberately run ashore near Jacksonville, Florida, without the loss of any passengers on board; however, the steamer itself was not salvageable. A dozen ships beached or capsized in Charleston's harbors, with many wharves demolished along the city's shoreline. The western part of Tradd Street, especially near Chisolm's Mill and South Bay's sidewalk, eroded as a result of wind and water, which also fractured the South Bay and East Battery walls. Gusts unroofed the Trinity Church along Hasell Street; the roof itself landed in an adjacent graveyard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2009-119&quot;/&gt; Despite extensive damage, only one death was noted in the city, that of a slave whose boat floundered at sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser2009-120&quot;&gt;Fraser 2009, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Unexpectedly low storm tides of {{convert|2|ft|in|abbr=on}} at [[Georgetown, South Carolina]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] inflicted no noteworthy damage. In general, however, the hurricane was reportedly the most severe since [[1824 Atlantic hurricane season|1824]] along the southeastern seaboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-153&quot;/&gt;

=== Mid-Atlantic and Northeast ===
[[File:1846 Emmons Agricultural Map of New York State - Geographicus - NewYork-emmons-1846.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of New York and portions of New England at the time of the hurricane|alt=A colored print map depicting several states and their boundaries]]
Not a single wharf at [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] escaped the hurricane's [[storm surge]], which inundated the length of [[Pratt Street]] along the shore; meanwhile, the [[Potomac River]] at [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Alexandria, Virginia]], attained its highest level in 20&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-94&quot;&gt;Ludlum 1963, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter two cities plagued by [[surface runoff]] on 13&amp;nbsp;October, following the storm's passage. The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] also bore the brunt of the storm's impact, having been swamped by potent rainfall as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz2007-61&quot;&gt;Schwartz 2007, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Low-lying areas along the [[Delaware River]], including [[New Castle, Delaware]], experienced storm tides not seen since the [[1775 Newfoundland hurricane]]. The floodwaters were high enough to even extinguish a fire in a stationary [[locomotive]] which had been impeded by the gale's rainfall. The local [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]'s steeple was tossed away by forceful gusts. To the north at [[Philadelphia]], the tempest was the most intense in 30&amp;nbsp;years, with its high tides engulfing every wharf in the city; a total of {{convert|1.25|in|cm|abbr=on}} of rain was measured at [[Pennsylvania Hospital]]. Despite widespread destruction along the Delaware River, damage to buildings in Philadelphia proper was less severe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-94&quot;/&gt; Heavy rainfall was also generated throughout western portions of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-95&quot;&gt;Ludlum 1963, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; In neighboring [[New Jersey]], considerable damage to structures, timber, land, and livestock was observed, with winds toppling several buildings and trees; widespread rainfall, meanwhile, flooded salt marshes, also drowning cattle and sheep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-94&quot;/&gt; High winds tangled poles and wires, in turn interrupting [[Telegraphy|telegraphic communications]] along the Washington-Baltimore-New York corridor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz2007-61&quot;/&gt;

Damage was similarly severe in [[New England]], despite the storm's [[extratropical cyclone#Extratropical transition|transition into a weaker extratropical cyclone]]. Despite being significantly farther east from [[New York City]], the storm produced severe impacts in the area. Significant damage was observed, with the waters of [[Upper New York Bay]] crashing over the [[Battery Park]] sea wall, washing away {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} of its length.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-95&quot;/&gt; Gusts caved in chimneys, uprooted trees, and sank several canal boats at the city's wharves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boose2001-HRD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Report Database|url=http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/sites/harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/files/data/p01/hf011/hf011-05-reports.txt|work=[[Harvard University]]|publisher=[[Harvard Forest]]|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], a rupture along the [[Erie Canal]] interrupted nearby traffic, and to the east in [[Dansville, Steuben County, New York|Dansville]], copious rainfall was also recorded. Approximately {{convert|1.25|in|cm|abbr=on}} of rain accompanied low [[atmospheric pressure]] readings throughout a wide area, with winds along the gale's eastern fringes, especially at [[Cape Cod|Cape Cod, Massachusetts]], remaining intense. In New England, it was generally considered to be the most severe storm since a previous disturbance in October&amp;nbsp;1841, despite having produced minimal rainfall totals throughout the region, including {{convert|0.33|in|cm|abbr=on}} at [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. Gusts felled trees paralleling both sides of a roadway from [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] to [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]]. Nearby at [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], winds flattened several factories, and also overturned a substantial number trees in the outskirts of [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-95&quot;/&gt; A newly built brick residence's walls in the southern end of the city collapsed; on the other side of the city, a sawing and planing mill was razed to the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boose2001-HRD&quot;/&gt;

Within the proximity of Boston at the towns of [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] and [[Southborough, Massachusetts|Southborough]], winds obliterated two factories. High winds at [[Grafton, Massachusetts|Grafton]] collapsed the railroad sheds under the ownership of the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]]. [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]] endured the loss of a mansion which was still under construction, and several smaller buildings were also blown down there and at [[Monson, Massachusetts|Monson]]. Winds upturned trees and toppled fences at [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], and nearby at [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]], a school building was crumbled into pieces by intense winds. At Springfield, winds unroofed a repair facility at a local railroad depot and a house at the [[Springfield Armory|town armory]]. Gusts destroyed railroad sheds and factories in [[Stoughton, Massachusetts|Stoughton]] and Worcester as well, and at [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]], winds crumbled a house into pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boose2001-HRD&quot;/&gt; Slightly to the south in [[Norwich, Connecticut]], fallen trees obstructed railroad tracks, and at [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], a railroad bridge was thrown farther upstream along the [[Connecticut River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludlum1963-95&quot;/&gt; Further railroad damage was noted to property owned by the [[Winchester and Potomac Railroad|Winchester and Potomac]], [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]], and other railroads throughout the region. Nearly all key bridges managed by those railroads were washed away, with many other track segments covered in debris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz2007-61&quot;/&gt; In all, the hurricane caused at least 164&amp;nbsp;deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;DATCs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rappaport, Edward N.|author2=Partagás, Jose Fernandez|title=The Deadliest Atlantic Tropical Cyclones, 1492–1996|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastdeadlyapp1.shtml?|work=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=22 April 1997|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath and records ==
[[File:Sand Key, Florida map pre-1846.png|thumb|right|190px|Map of Sand Key, Florida prior to the 1846 hurricane|alt=A sketch of an island's shape and its dimensions]]
Immediately following the storm's end, the [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Quartermaster]] permitted homeless citizens to rest in its local barracks. Food, water, and supplies were lacking, with most having been washed away, rendered unusable, or become inedible due to the storm's salty [[storm surge]]. The ''Morris'''s captain obtained supplies from a damaged vessel, sending them to a local Methodist minister. Efforts to reconstruct and recover from the disaster were not immediate due to the lack of available resources. With the loss of area lighthouses, local waters were difficult to navigate, with one shipwreck occurring as a result west of Key West; in response, a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} staff was placed at the former location of the now-destroyed [[Key West lighthouse]]. Many vessels were also lost near Sand Key Light,&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-10&quot;/&gt; and decades later, the tower, poorly maintained due to a lack of government funding, continued to deteriorate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-11&quot;/&gt;

The 1846 hurricane resulted in a variety of both geological, geographical, and ecological alterations. In [[Key West]], the local salt pond shifted from its original position, becoming a hindrance to local residents and requiring it to be filled up; eventually, the tourist district of Key West emerged over the former site of the salt pond. By December&amp;nbsp;1846, [[Sand Key Light|Sand Key]], which was inundated during the hurricane, resurfaced from the waters of the Atlantic. However, it was situated approximately {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} west of its location prior to the hurricane, and even months later, the lighthouse remained under {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} of seawater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-10&quot;/&gt; Years afterward, greenery on the key was sparse, and little native vegetation existed. Signs of ecological damage remained even in the early 1880s, evidenced by the presence of [[Juncaceae|rush]]es among the leaves of trees and bushes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm2010-11&quot;&gt;Malcolm 2010, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1846&amp;nbsp;Havana hurricane was likely of Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity, the earliest known [[tropical cyclone]] of its strength to strike [[Cuba]].&lt;!-- 1844 was probably a C4. In addition, this can be verified with indirect reasoning, given previous Cuban hurricanes --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Landsea2012-883&quot;/&gt; In 1993, the weather historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás analyzed an anomalous [[atmospheric pressure]] of 916&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (27.06&amp;nbsp;[[inch of mercury|inHg]]) measured at Havana upon the vessel ''Thames'', deeming it to be abnormally low and evaluating its true value to be closer to 938&amp;nbsp;mbar (27.70&amp;nbsp;inHg), making the hurricane the most intense in recorded history at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partagás1993-1&quot;/&gt; The exceptionally low pressure reading in Cuba surpassed a previous record of 948&amp;nbsp;mbar (28.00&amp;nbsp;inHg) set by an 1844&amp;nbsp;storm, with the new record eventually exceeded by the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]], which featured a manually recorded pressure reading of 932&amp;nbsp;mbar (27.52&amp;nbsp;inHg).&lt;ref name=&quot;Partagás1993-4&quot;&gt;Partagás 1993, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Although the [[1910 Cuba hurricane]] also exceeded the record and the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]] each had lower pressures in the [[HURDAT]] database, those pressure measurements were estimated. For the purposes of this article, all pressure records are not estimated.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}
