He was a contemporary with the [[Ancient Egypt|Ptolemaic Greek Queen]] [[Cleopatra]] VII and [[Roman Republic|Roman Triumvir]] [[Mark Antony]],&lt;ref name=&quot;tyndalehouse2&quot;/&gt; as Artavasdes I was mentioned in their diplomatic affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=nRKDGwn_CRkC&amp;pg=PA916&amp;dq=%22Artavasdes+I+of+Media+Atropatene%22&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Artavasdes%20I%20of%20Media%20Atropatene%22&amp;f=false] Politische Geschichte (Provinzen Und Randvalker Griechischer Balkanraum; Kleinasien); Temporini, Hildegard, Haas, and Wolfgang. (Published 1980) p.916&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family background and early life==
Artavasdes I was of [[Media (region)|Median]] and possibly of [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]] descent. He was the child born to [[Ariobarzanes I of Media Atropatene|Ariobarzanes I]] by an unnamed wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranicaonline1&quot;/&gt; His probable paternal uncle could have been [[Darius I of Media Atropatene|Darius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/1998-08/0903422361 |title=Settipani on Baldwin on the Commagenian DFA Link Part 2 of 3 |publisher=Archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=1998-08-17 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born and raised in the Kingdom of Media Atropatene. Artavasdes I is the namesake of his ancestor, [[Artabazanes]] a previous ruling King of Media Atropatene in the 3rd century BC, as the name ''Artavasdes'' is a variation of the name ''Artabazanes'' (see [[Asha]]).

According to modern genealogies the father of Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was a son of a previous ruling King [[Mithridates I of Media Atropatene]] and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the [[Artaxiad Dynasty]] who was a daughter of the Armenian King [[Tigranes the Great]] and his wife, [[Cleopatra of Pontus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], 36.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, ''Manual genealogy and chronology for the Christian Caucasus (Armenia, Georgia, Albania)'', p.p.81-82&lt;/ref&gt; which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Another possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name ''Artavasdes'' bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;tyndalehouse2&quot;/&gt;

==Reign as King==
Artavasdes I succeeded his father as King, when Ariobarzanes I died in 56 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranicaonline1&quot;/&gt; When [[Mark Antony]] led his campaign against the [[Parthian Empire]] in 36 BC, Artavasdes I was an ally of the King [[Phraates IV of Parthia]]. Antony led his troops from [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]] northward into [[Armenia]] and then invaded the domain of Artavasdes I. Antony did not want to attack Parthia from the west, which was the shortest way, but surprisingly from the north. Antony allegedly used this strategy on the advice of [[Artavasdes II of Armenia]], the enemy of Artavasdes I.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' 49.25.1&lt;/ref&gt; Antony moved with his army in fast marches to Phraaspa, the strong fortified capital of Media Atropatene, where Artavasdes I had got his family to safety. Meantime Artavasdes I had joined the army of Phraates IV.

Antony was not able to take Phraaspa and besieged the city, but Artavasdes I and the Parthian commander Monaeses destroyed two legions of Antony's general, Oppius Statianus, who had slowly followed with the siege machines of the Antony's troops. Antony could not capture Phraaspa without these machines. Therefore, he had to withdraw to [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] and Parthia was not invaded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Antony'' 38-40; Cassius Dio, ''Roman history'' 49.25-26; [[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'' 11, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

So Artavasdes I had maintained his ground against the Romans but his domain had been severely ravaged. Besides his stronger ally [[Phraates IV]] treated him condescending and gave him only little booty and was near depriving him of his dominion. Therefore, in 35 BC Artavasdes I offered Antony an alliance against Parthia, and Antony gladly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Antony'' 52.1-3; Cassius Dio, ''Roman history'' 49.33.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; To deepen this friendship [[Alexander Helios]], the son of Antony and Cleopatra VII, was betrothed to Artavasdes I’s daughter [[Iotapa (daughter of Artavasdes I)|Iotapa]], although both were infants in 34 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman history'' 49.40.2; Plutarch, ''Antony'' 53.12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 33 BC Antony met his coalition partner on the river [[Aras River|Araxes]]; they agreed that Antony should support Artavasdes I against Parthia and that the Median King should help Antony against [[Augustus|Octavian]]. They interchanged parts of their troops. The domain of Artavasdes I was enlarged with parts of Armenia. Antony had returned a [[Flag|standard]] that the Median king had taken from Oppius Statianus in 36 BC, and also took [[Iotapa (daughter of Artavasdes I)|Iotapa]] along with him. With the help of the Roman reinforcements Artavasdes I was initially able to repulse the Parthian attack. Before the [[Battle of Actium]], Antony called back his Roman troops without sending back the Median reinforcements. This time [[Phraates IV]] defeated Artavasdes I who was captured in 30 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman history'' 49.44.1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

During Artavasdes' imprisonment, a civil war between the Parthians later took place, which gave him the opportunity to escape prison. He took refuge with [[Augustus]], who received him with friendliness,&lt;ref&gt;Monumentum Ancyranum 33&lt;/ref&gt; gave him back his daughter [[Iotapa (daughter of Artavasdes I)|Iotapa]]&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman history'' 51.16.2&lt;/ref&gt; and made him a [[Client state|Client King]] of [[Lesser Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodor Mommsen]] concludes this from Cassius Dio, ''Roman history'' 54.9.2&lt;/ref&gt; He died around 20 BC probably in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Compare his [[epitaph]] found in Rome: CIL VI 1798&lt;/ref&gt; Artavasdes I was succeeded in the Kingship of Media Atropatene by [[Asinnalus of Media Atropatene|Asinnalus]].

==Issue==
Artavasdes I was a son-in-law of King [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene]]&lt;ref name=&quot;tyndalehouse1&quot;/&gt; and his wife, [[Isias|Isias Philostorgos]], as he married one of their daughters [[Athenais of Media Atropatene|Athenais]], a Princess from Commagene who was of Armenian and Greek descent.&lt;ref&gt;Her name is known from surviving numismatic evidence, as her royal title on coins is in Greek ''ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΑ ΑΘΗΝΑΙΣ'' or ''of Queen Athenais''&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps, Artavasdes I and Athenais may have been distantly related.

* Daughter, [[Iotapa (daughter of Artavasdes I)|Iotapa]] who was engaged to the Ptolemaic Greek Prince [[Alexander Helios]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/helios.htm |title=Ptolemaic Genealogy: Alexander Helios |publisher=Tyndalehouse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014080021/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/helios.htm |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who later married her maternal cousin, [[Mithridates III of Commagene]]&lt;ref name=&quot;tyndalehouse1&quot;/&gt;
* Son, [[Ariobarzanes II of Atropatene|Ariobarzanes II]]&lt;ref name=&quot;tyndalehouse1&quot;/&gt;
* Son, [[Darius II of Media Atropatene|Darius II]].&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, ''Comments on &quot;Iberian route&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; He married an [[Parthian Empire|unnamed Parthian Arsacid Princess]], by whom they had two sons: the Parthian Kings [[Artabanus III (of Parthia)|Artabanus III]] and [[Vonones II of Parthia|Vonones II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tyndalehouse1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tyndalehouse2&quot;/&gt;

==Inscription Evidence==
In [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], two Epitaph inscriptions have been found bearing the name of an Artavasdes. The Epitaphs are probably of the son and the grandson of a Median Atropatenian King called ''Ariobarzanes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranicaonlineiii&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azerbaijan-iii |title=Azerbaijan iii. Pre-Islamic History, Atropates, Persian satrap of Media, made himself independent in 321 B.C. Thereafter Greek and Latin writers named the territory as Media Atropatene or, less frequently, Media Minor: Parthian period |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is uncertain, if the ''Ariobarzanes'' refers to Ariobarzanes I or his grandson [[Ariobarzanes II of Atropatene|Ariobarzanes II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iranicaonlineiii&quot;/&gt; Artavasdes I is mentioned in paragraphs 27 and 33 of the [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]].
