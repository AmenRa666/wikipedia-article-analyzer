'''Saint Padarn's Church''' is a [[parish church]] of the [[Church in Wales]], and the largest [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] [[Church (building)|church]] in [[Mid Wales|mid-Wales]].

Founded in the early sixth century, St Padarn's Church has gone through many changes, from a Welsh monastic centre (a [[Clas (ecclesiastical settlement)|''clas'']]), a [[Benedictine]] [[priory]], a ''clas'' again, a royal [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rectory]], a church controlled by Chesterâ€™s [[Vale Royal Abbey]], and since 1538 a parish church under a [[vicar]]. It is at [[Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion|Llanbadarn Fawr]], near [[Aberystwyth]], in [[Ceredigion]], [[Wales]], [[United Kingdom]].

==History==

Although its origins are obscure, the site of the present ancient church has been used for [[Christian]] worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, probably by [[Padarn|Saint Padarn]],&lt;ref name=&quot;E. G. Bowen, 1979&quot;&gt;E.G. Bowen, ''A History of Llanbadarn Fawr'' (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; after whom it was named.&lt;ref&gt;Llanbadarn Fawr means &quot;great church of Padarn&quot;; cf. [[Llanbadarn Fawr, Powys]]; http://www.cpat.org.uk/ycom/radnor/llanbadarnfawr.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Morgan, ''Ceredigion: A wealth of History'' (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are certain elements which are reasonably clear.&lt;ref&gt;The standard history, E.G. Bowen, ''A History of Llanbadarn Fawr'' (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), remains useful though it is now outdated.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of the foundation in the sixth century===

[[File:Saint Patern.jpg|thumb|St Padarn, as portrayed in an [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[icon]]. It is likely that St Padarn, if indeed a bishop, would have worn [[chasuble]], [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and girdle, over the [[alb]] (the long white coat), a cappa (long black cloak) or (coloured) [[cope]], a crown-like [[mitre]] and a [[pallium]]. There is a good chance he carried a [[crozier]], and may also have worn a [[pectoral cross]], around his neck.]]

Whilst the exact date Saint Padarn founded the church is uncertain, it seems clear however that Llanbadarn Fawr was an early sixth-century foundation, a [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] [[Clas (ecclesiastical settlement)|''clas'']] church. The church may have been the seat of an [[abbot]] or [[bishop]] during the years immediately following Saint Padarn, who was traditionally said to be its first bishop&lt;ref name=&quot;D.P. Kirby 1994 pp. 365-177&quot;&gt;D. P. Kirby, &quot;The Coming of Christianity&quot; in J.L. Davies and D.P. Kirby (eds), ''Cardiganshire County History'' (Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society, 1994), vol I, pp. 365â€“177, at pp. 370â€“1.&lt;/ref&gt; (as a ''clas'' church, it was not a [[cathedral]] as we understand the term today, but closer to a [[collegiate church]]&lt;ref&gt;Church buildings embodying the functions of a cathedral first appear in [[Italy]], [[Gaul]], [[Spain]] and North [[Africa]] in the fourth century, but cathedrals did not become universal within the Western Catholic Church until the twelfth century. Also, as Pearson observed &quot;Before the eleventh century Welsh dioceses in the fixed territorial sense were not the norm: a major centre of ecclesiastical power, the ''clas'' church or ''monasterium'', exerted influence through daughter-houses, and the area of this influence waxed and waned with the power that the local ruler could exert over his neighbours. The term ''clas'', plural ''clasau'', probably derived from ''classis'', meaning a gathering or group of people, a ''corpus'' or ''collegium''. Perhaps of monastic origin, such churches were headed by either a bishop or an abbot, and were usually regarded as [[Mother Church|mother-churches]], although the term could be applied to smaller ecclesiastical institutions. ''Claswyr'', or those clerics who normally lived within the church, were usually styled canons; however, this title is a post-Norman usage which reflects the conditions of that period.&quot; See &quot;Introduction: The Welsh cathedrals 1066â€“1300&quot;, in M.J. Pearson (ed), ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066â€“1300: Volume 9, the Welsh Cathedrals (Bangor, Llandaff, St Asaph, St Davids)'' (Institute of Historical Research, London, 2003), pp. xixâ€“xxiv http://www.british-history.ac.uk/fasti-ecclesiae/1066-1300/vol9/xix-xxiv. Pearson relied on Giraldus Cambrensis, book III, page 153; ''Llyfr Iorwerth: a Critical Text of the Venodotian Code of Medieval Welsh Law mainly from B. M. Cotton Titus D. ii'', ed. A.R. William (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1960), pp. 43â€“4; N. Edwards and A. Lane, &quot;The archaeology of the early Welsh Church in Wales: an introduction&quot; in N. Edwards and A. Lane (eds), ''The Early Church in Wales and the West'' (Oxbow Books, Oxford, 1992), Oxbow Monograph xvi, pp. 1â€“10, at p. 3; J.W. Evans, &quot;The survival of the clas as an institution in medieval Wales: some observations on Llanbadarn Fawr&quot;, ibid. pp. 33â€“40, at pp. 33, 36; Sir John Edward Lloyd, ''History of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, 1911), vol I, p. 205; H. Pryce, &quot;Pastoral care in early medieval Wales&quot;, in J. Blair and R. Sharpe (eds), ''Pastoral Care before the Parish'' (Leicester University Press, Leicester, 1992), pp. 41â€“62, at pp. 48â€“50; Pearson, ''Bangor chapter'' pp. 168â€“9; Huw Pryce, ''Native Law and the Church in Medieval Wales'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993), pp. 165â€“74, 191â€“2 [accessed 10 April 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;), nor did it necessarily possess any substantial buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Generally, see Heather James, &quot;The Archaeology of Early Christianity in Cardiganshire&quot; in J.L. Davies and D.P. Kirby (eds), ''Cardiganshire County History'' (Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society, 1994), vol I, pp. 397â€“407. Bowen noted that there might have a dozen monks, living in individual beehive-shaped cells; E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the leading ''clasau'' of early Christian Wales, and the one we know most about, partly because of the significant role it played as a literary centre.

===Saint Padarn===

Very little is known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and almost nothing with any degree of certainty; the earliest literary reference to him is by [[Rhygyfarch]] in about 1097.&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Bowen, ''A History of Llanbadarn Fawr'' (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, 1979), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to construct a general outline of his life from the little that we do have.

Following the general custom of Europe in the late classical and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a [[saint]], along with several hundred other Welsh men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Generally, see Elissa R. Henken, ''Traditions of the Welsh Saints'' (D.S. Brewer, 1987); Elissa R. Henken, ''The Welsh Saints: A Study in Patterned Lives'' (Boydell &amp; Brewer, Woodbridge, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; But the date and circumstances of the foundation of the church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a ''Vita'' or Latin ''Life'', following the example of the ''Life of St David'' written at Llanbadarn about 1090.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Wade-Evans, ''Life of St. David'' (SPCK, London, 1923).&lt;/ref&gt; That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such ''lives''. They are not biographies as we understand them today.&lt;ref&gt;Hagiographic works, particularly those of the [[Middle Ages]], can often incorporate a valuable record of institutional and [[local history]], and evidence of popular [[cult (religious practice)|cult]]s, customs, and [[tradition]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead they were [[hagiography|hagiographies]], designed to elevate the saintâ€™s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas J. Heffernan, ''Sacred Biography: Saints and Their Biographers in the Middle Ages'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally Padarn was said to come originally from [[Brittany]], but he may have come from south-east Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Butler believes that he was probably born and educated in south-east Wales; Peter Bartrum, ''Early Welsh Genealogical Tracts'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1966), reprints ByS 21, which recounts the tradition that Padarn was, like David, descended from [[Ceredig|Ceredig ap Cunedda]], in Padarn's case through his mother Gwen ferch Ceredig ap Cunedda. This is certainly possible, and would have helped him secure a strong base from which to evangelise Ceredigion. See also Alban Butler and Paul Burns, ''Butler's Lives of the Saints: April'' (A. &amp; C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to be both abbot and bishop&lt;ref name=&quot;D.P. Kirby 1994 pp. 365-177&quot;/&gt; (the distinction was not so great then as it later became&lt;ref&gt;Dioceses were fluid at this time in Wales, and equally, a bishop did not necessarily have the territorial attributes the ecclesiastical rank was later to obtain. Bishops were, as Lewis described them, &quot;a kind of missionary bishop&quot;; Frank Lewis, &quot;The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages&quot; (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15â€“40, at p. 16; Sir John Edward Lloyd, ''History of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, 1912), vol I, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;) for many years, and from his base at what is now known as Llanbadarn Fawr (great or high church of St Padarn) he [[evangelisation|evangelised]] the neighbouring countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally with the help of the eight hundred and forty-seven monks (doubtless a grossly exaggerated number) he was said to have brought with him{{mdashb}}the accounts suggest that he founded a community 120 strong at Llanbadarn Fawr; this figure is almost certainly a gross exaggeration; as noted above, Bowen suggest that there might have a dozen monks; E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little more can be said of Padarn, though he later attracted the usual [[hagiography]], the ''Vita Sancti Paternus'', which recounts many supposed details of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et Genealogiae'' ed. A. W. Wade-Evans (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been more closely associated with late [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British civilization]] than some other early British saints,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rees, ''Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003), p. 225. The [[Anglo-Saxons]] gained control of what we now refer to as eastern England in the fifth century. In the mid-sixth century they started expanding into the Midlands, then in the seventh century they expanded again into the south-west and the north of England. The unconquered parts of southern Britain, notably what we now call Wales, retained their Romano-British culture, in particular preserving Christianity. If St Padarn were from south east Wales it is more probable that he would have represented a sub-Roman survival. For the Roman period in Ceredigion generally, see J. L. Davies, &quot;The Roman Period&quot; in J. L. Davies and D. P. Kirby (eds), ''Cardiganshire County History'' (Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society, 1994), vol I, pp. 276â€“317.&lt;/ref&gt; as his dedications are apparently connected by [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman roads]].&lt;ref&gt;His seven known dedications are beside two Roman roads that run north and south linking forts on either side of the Cambrian mountains. This implies, according to Rees, that Padarn's followers worked around the ruined Roman garrisons; Elizabeth Rees, ''Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003), p. 225. According to Evans, &quot;On the west side of the mountains Llanbadarn Fawr,  Llanbadarn Fach [Llanbadarn Trefeglwys], Llanbadarn Odwyn and Pencarreg [now dedicated to [[St Patrick]]] church are situated near to the Roman road running north from Carmarthen to Llanio, which then follows the ancient [[Sarn Helen]] route across the Ystwyth river to the Roman fort at Pennal in Meirionethshire. On the eastern side of the mountains (another) Llanbadarn [possibly he means St Padarn's Church, Cross Gates, Llandrindod Wells], Llanbadarn Fynydd and Llanbadarn Garreg follow the Roman road from Y Gaer at Brecon to the Roman fort at Castell Collen&quot;; Neil Evans, &quot;The Golden Age of the Welsh Saints: St Padarn&quot; (http://www.parishofaberystwyth.org.uk/history.html). There is also a church dedicated to St Padarn in [[Gwynedd]] ([[Llanberis]]), although the village where it is sited is named after [[Saint Peris|St Peris]]. This is however new, having been built on virgin ground in 1884â€“5 by Arthur Baker; E. Beazley and P. Howell, ''The Companion Guide to North Wales'' (HarperCollins, London, 1975), p. 150; The Builder, 7 February 1885, pp. 198, 201 &amp; 15 August 1885, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed to be close to where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called [[Sarn Helen]]&lt;ref&gt;Variously said to be named after [[Saint Elen]] of [[Caernarfon]], a [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic saint]], whose story is told in ''[[The Dream of Macsen Wledig]]'' part of the Welsh ''[[Mabinogion]]''. She is said to have ordered the construction of roads in Wales during the late fourth century, and traditionally, she is said to have been a daughter of the [[Romano-British]] ruler [[Eudaf Hen]] (Octavius) and the wife of Macsen ([[Magnus Maximus|Magnus Clemens Maximus]]), the fourth-century [[list of Roman emperors|emperor]] in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], [[Gaul]], and [[Spain]] who was killed in battle in 388; Elizabeth Rees, ''Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;) crosses the [[Afon Rheidol|river Rheidol]]. Sarn Helen passes close to [[Strata Florida Abbey|Strata Florida]] and [[Llanddewi Brefi]]&lt;ref&gt;At the [[Synod of Brefi]], {{circa}} 550/560, St David refuted the teaching of St [[Cadoc]], (reputedly guilty of reviving the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] [[heresy|heresies]] concerning [[original sin]] and [[free will]]), his victory aided by the miraculous uprising of the mound on which the church is built;&lt;/ref&gt; which, along with Llanbadarn Fawr, were the three most important ecclesiastic places in mediaeval Ceredigion.

[[File:Sarn Helen, Ceredigion - geograph.org.uk - 566168.jpg|thumb|A section of the Roman road, Sarn Helen, in Ceredigion]]

According to tradition, Padarn continued to preside over his [[Episcopal see|see]] for twenty-one years,&lt;ref&gt;According to the Latin [[hexameters]] of Johannes Sulgenus, son of Sulgen.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time he was said to have erected a number of churches and founded several monasteries in the [[province]] or [[lordship]] of [[Kingdom of Ceredigion|Ceredigion]],&lt;ref&gt;According to [[John of Tynemouth (chronicler)|John of Tynemouth]]; V. H. Galbraith, &quot;The Historia Aurea of John, Vicar of Tynemouth and the Sources of the St Albans Chronicle (1327â€“1377)&quot;, in H. W. C. Davis (ed), ''Essays in History Presented to Reginald Lane Poole'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1927), pp. 379â€“95.&lt;/ref&gt; later [[Cardiganshire]] (and in modern times once again known as Ceredigion), where he placed colonies of monks from the principal establishment at Llanbadarn Fawr. His preaching throughout west Wales was attested to in the [[Welsh Triads]].&lt;ref&gt;The &quot;Welsh Triads&quot; ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', literally ''Triads of the Island of [[Great Britain|Britain]]'') are a group of related texts in medieval [[manuscript]]s which preserve fragments of Welsh [[folklore]], [[Welsh mythology|mythology]] and traditional history in groups of three. The triad is a rhetorical form whereby objects are grouped together in threes, with a heading indicating the point of likeness; Rachel Bromwich (editor and translator), ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Welsh Triads'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 3rd Edition, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of that period, possibly being recalled to Brittany, where he was made bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Vannes]] (though it is more than likely that this was a distinct individual&lt;ref&gt;Alban Butler and Paul Burns, ''Butler's Lives of the Saints: April'' (A. &amp; C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;), he was succeeded as abbot of the church at Llanbadarn Fawr and bishop of the proto-diocese, which was subsequently called, after its first bishop, &quot;Paternensis,&quot; by Cynog. It has been suggested that St Padarn himself may have been buried on [[Bardsey Island]], the legendary &quot;Island of 20,000 saints&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Elissa R. Henken, ''Traditions of the Welsh Saints'' (D.S. Brewer, 1987), pp. 121â€“127. Generally, on Saint Padarn, see Alban Butler and Paul Burns, ''Butler's Lives of the Saints: April'' (A. &amp; C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102; G. H. Doble, ''St Patern'' (Series of Cornish Saints, no 43, 1940); Elissa R. Henken, ''Traditions of the Welsh Saints'' (D.S. Brewer, 1987), pp. 121â€“127.&lt;/ref&gt; But as with any detail of his life, we cannot be certain. [[Gildas]]'s ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' is, with [[Saint Patrick]]'s somewhat earlier ''Confessio'', almost the only contemporary source for this period.

===Padarn's ''Life''===

The anonymous author tells us that Padarn's parents were nobly born [[Armorica]]ns ([[Breton people|Bretons]]), and that he sailed to Britain with 847 monks to settle and build a monastery. He established monasteries and churches throughout Ceredigion. The attempt of [[Maelgwn Gwynedd|Maelgwn]], king of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], to ruin Padarn rebounds on him through a [[miracle]], and he compensates Padarn with the gift of lands between the rivers [[Afon Rheidol|Rheidol]] and [[Afon Clarach|Clarach]].&lt;ref&gt;Maelgwn is portrayed as a tyrant and opponent of the Church, not only in the ''Life'' of St Padarn but also in that of [[Saint Mungo|Saint Kentigern]] and of Saint Cadoc. Maelgwn, &quot;the great tempter of the saints&quot; arriving at the river Clarach, falsely accuses Padarn of theft and is thereby struck blind but restored at Padarn's intercession, after granting Padarn all the land from the river Rheidol to its source.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Padarn is closely associated with Saint David and [[Saint Teilo]] in a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Jerusalem]] in which the three are honoured by the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Unfortunately, church records are almost as poor for this period in the [[Holy Land]] as they are in Wales. The Patriarchate traces its line of succession to the first Christian bishops of Jerusalem, the first being [[James the Just]] in the first century AD. Jerusalem was granted [[autocephaly]] in 451 by the [[Council of Chalcedon]] and in 531 became one of the initial five [[patriarch]]ates.&lt;/ref&gt; Padarn was given a [[tunic]]&lt;ref&gt;It is possible that this tunic was a [[chasuble]], which was adopted by the clergy in the sixth century, though it is said that Jesus himself wore one at the last supper, and its use was limited to the eucharist in the eleventh century. This is plausible, as it developed from the ''casula'', which was derived from the ''planeta'' or ''paenula'', a cloak worn by all classes and both sexes in the Graeco-Roman world. The ''paenula'', a cloak similar to the poncho, was an over-dress originally worn only by slaves, soldiers, and others of low degree. Because of its convenience, it was adopted by fashion in the third century as a travelling cloak.&lt;/ref&gt; â€“ which later featured in the best known legend associated with him â€“ and a staff. Most likely this account is fabricated, as are much of the details of the lives of the early saints, from a variety of sources, real and imagined.

In the most celebrated episode of the ''Vita Sancti Paternus'', [[King Arthur]] tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn calls on the earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg forgiveness before he is released. This seems to borrow the story of a different Padarn, [[Padarn Beisrudd|Padarn Redcoat]], whose coat was one of the ''[[Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain]]'' (''Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain'').&lt;ref&gt;These are a series of items in late mediaeval [[Wales|Welsh]] tradition. Lists of the items appear in texts dating to the fifteenth and sixth centuries. ''Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain'', ed. and tr. Rachel Bromwich (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, revised ed. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur is scarcely better recorded than Padarn. Principal sources include the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', and the writings of [[Gildas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There follow confusing episodes involving Brittany (sometimes called Letia). Padarn finally leaves for [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;At this time France (under the [[Merovingians]]) was smaller than it is today.&lt;/ref&gt; where he dies, but his remains are brought back and buried in [[Vannes]]. A final chapter tells how Padarn, David and Teilo divide south Wales into three episcopates, with Padarn as bishop of Ceredigion. Then, convinced by a miracle performed by Padarn, a local governor called Eithir is persuaded to give land between the rivers Rheidol and Paith to Padarn. The lands owned by Llanbadarn in the twelfth century were between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach. The Paith is a minor [[tributary]] of the [[River Ystwyth]]. The obscure figure of Eithyr is commemorated in the farm name of Llaneithr, which stands a mile east of [[Devil's Bridge, Ceredigion|Devil's Bridge]] near the river [[Afon Mynach|Mynach]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;This section owes much to Gerald Morgan; Gerald Morgan, ''Ceredigion: A wealth of History'' (Gower, Llandysul, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Life'' is difficult to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known to him and transfers them to the saint himself. Thus there was in the twelfth century a holy relic at Llanbadarn believed to have been Padarn's staff, Cyrwen, which could well be the origin of the place name [[Llangorwen]]. The writer obviously knew very little indeed about Padarn, except that he was seen as a contemporary of David and Teilo, who certainly lived during the sixth century.

We must live with our virtually complete ignorance of Padarnâ€™s life.&lt;ref name=&quot;E. G. Bowen, 1979&quot; /&gt; It is fair to say, however, that if he had died at Llanbadarn there would have been a [[shrine]], traditions of which would have survived for centuries; none are recorded. Therefore, we can see him as one of the more peripatetic of the missionaries of this period, who spent sufficient time in the Rheidol valley to attract a community of Christian men to him which was sufficiently strong to survive his departure. It could have been these followers in subsequent generations who would have established churches in the saint's name in mid-Wales ([[Llanbadarn Fynydd]], Llanbadarn Garreg&lt;ref&gt;Now Llanbadarn-y-Garreg. St Padarn's Church is a simple single-cell church built in the thirteenth-fourth century. The dedication and location adjacent to the river favour an early medieval origin for Llanbadarn church. There are however few mediaeval records, perhaps because it was a chapelry attached to the church at Cregrina.&lt;/ref&gt;), and in Ceredigion (Llanbadarn Odwyn,&lt;ref&gt;It formerly constituted a prebend in the collegiate church of [[Llanddewi Brefi]], founded by [[Thomas Bek (bishop of St David's)|Thomas Bek]], [[Bishop of St David's]], in 1187.&lt;/ref&gt; Llanbadarn Trefeglwys [also known as Llanbadarn Fach]&lt;ref&gt;This also formerly constituted one of the prebends in the collegiate church of Llanddewi Brefi. The former collegiate church at Llanddewi Brefi is fourteenth and nineteenth century. A Celtic monastery was replaced in 1287 by a college of secular canons. Of the medieval church the fourteenth century crossing tower survives and part of the chancel; Glanmor Williams, &quot;The Collegiate Church of Llanddewibrefi&quot; (1963) 4 Ceredigion: Journal of the Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 336-52.&lt;/ref&gt;), if he didn't establish them himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rees, ''Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The see of Llanbadarn===

Like so much else, this is hard to say, but the balance of historians' judgements is that there may well have been bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church organisation in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, and there were no fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's ''Life'' that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now [[Radnorshire]] (mid-[[Powys]]). Ceredigion south of the [[river Wyre]] was [[Saint David|David]] country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of [[Diocese of St David's|St David's]]; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Edward Lloyd, ''The Story of Ceredigion 400â€“1277'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937).&lt;/ref&gt; Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. [[Gerald of Wales]] (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the ''clas'' which held the church at the time of his visit in 1188.&lt;ref&gt;For the Ceredigion background see D. P. Kirby, Padraig O Riain, Heather James and W. Gwyn Thomas, â€˜The Church in Ceredigion in the Early Middle Agesâ€™ in J.L. Davies and D.P. Kirby (eds), ''The Cardiganshire County History: Volume 1'' (Cardiff, 1994), pp. 365â€“420.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The flourishing of Llanbadarn Fawr===

The see, if such it may be called, appears to have existed for a century, if indeed it didn't come into existence in the years after Padarn himself. There is note of a bishop of Llanbadarn in the minutes of a synod held at [[Abberley]], [[Worcestershire]], in about the year 603, though this is an unreliable source.&lt;ref&gt;The record of bishops everywhere prior to the tenth century is fragmentary.&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, at this meeting, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], St [[Augustine of Canterbury]], to persuade Celtic bishops â€“ Llanbadarn Fawr was one of seven present â€“ to submit to his authority. Certainly the reputation of Padarn and the wealth and influence of his ''clas'', ensured that the developing [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] of [[Saint David|David]] did not prevail in northern Ceredigion,&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Edward Lloyd, ''The Story of Ceredigion 400â€“1277'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937), p 48.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly in large part due to the extensive lands possessed by the ''clas'', apparently from the river Clarach to the river Rheidol.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd accepts this, and the influence of Padarn in this area, to the almost complete exclusion of St David, is significant, even if we discount the story in the ''Life'' of Padarn, that [[Maelgwn Gwynedd]], King of [[Gwynedd]] agreed to grant St Padarn, lands &quot;from the mouth of the river Rheidol upwards until it touches at its head the limit of the river Clarach, and along the length of the same river as far as the sea is the limit prolonged&quot;; A. W. Wade-Evans and Scott Lloyd (ed), ''Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et genelogiae: Classic Texts in Medieval Welsh Studies v. 1: The Lives and Genealogies of the Welsh Saints (Studies in Medieval Wales)'' (Welsh Academic Press, 2nd Revised edition, 2013), pp. 258â€“9.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, as in the ''Life of Saint Padarn'', the ''Lives'' tell how the saint gains lands which as the time of writing were claimed by the saintâ€™s foundation as its endowment.&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Sanctia Paterni: the Life of Saint Padarn'' eds Charles Thomas and David Howlett (2003) 33 Trivium.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if much of the history of Saint Padarn and the early years of his church cannot be relied upon as accurate (and there is evidence that it conflates several near-contemporary individuals&lt;ref&gt;Butler notes that the difficulty with Padarn's history is that we have only one ''Life'', and that a comparatively late one (1120), written at Llanbadarn Fawr. This confusion appears to have occurred due to the use of an earlier account of the Welsh saint, and accounts of the Breton saint who was bishop of Vannes. But it is possible, despite this, that they were indeed one and the same person, given the significant cultural links then surviving between south Wales, Brittany and south west England; Alban Butler and Paul Burns, ''Butler's Lives of the Saints: April'' (A. &amp; C. Black, London, revised edition, 1999), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;), there can be no doubt of his importance as one of the leading evangelists of Wales in the early sixth century, and the ongoing importance of his ''clas''.

The ''clas'' church remained important after 601, although the &quot;Gwentian&quot; version of the ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]'' (''Chronicle of the Princes'') records that the diocese of Llanbadarn was ravaged by the Saxons in 720.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The unbelieving Saxon broke many of the churches of Llandaff, Menevia and Llanbadarn, and killed Aidan, bishop of Llandaff, and many of the learned men of his see&quot;; W. Pickering, ''Brut y Tywysogion'' (1864) 10 Archaeologica Cambrensis p. 7. The less complete ''[[Red Book of Hergest]]'' (''Llyfr coch Hergest'') records merely that the year was a hot one; John Williams ab Ithel (ed), ''[[Red Book of Hergest]]'' (''Llyfr coch Hergest'') (Rolls Series, London, 1860), p. 5. [[Rice Rees]], ''An Essay on the Welsh Saints or the primitive Christians, usually considered to have been the founders of churches in Wales'' (Longmans, London, 1836).&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been this that led to the loss of its bishop, however this is very uncertain as the entry is probably a much later forgery by [[Iolo Morganwg]].&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Bowen, ''A History of Llanbadarn Fawr'' (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, however, the loss of the episcopal status was as a result of the violent conduct of the inhabitants, who killed their bishop. According to this tradition, having offended a local leader in a feud, Idnertha, who was then bishop of Llanbadarn, was killed, and subsequently buried in [[Llanddewi Brefi]]. The date of this event is very unclear. Some sources have Idnertha as the bishop of Llanbadarn at the synod in 603, others have him as being killed by the [[Saxons]] 100 years later.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aberystwythguide.org.uk/history/to1100.shtml. Generally, see D.P. Kirby, &quot;The Political Development of Ceredigion, c.400â€“1081&quot; in J.L. Davies and D.P. Kirby (eds), ''Cardiganshire County History'' (Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society, 1994), vol I, pp. 318â€“342.&lt;/ref&gt;

All we can be certain of is that, if there was a bishop of Llanbadarn in 601 â€“ and possibly 720 â€“ there appears to have been none in later years (though note the later use of the style &quot;bishop&quot; during [[Gerald of Wales]]'s visit in 1188). But that did not diminish the power and influence of the ''clas'' at Llanbadarn Fawr.&lt;ref&gt;Rees suggests that they may have become a reformed [[Culdees|Culdee]] community, although there does not appear to be any evidence to support this hypothesis; Elizabeth Rees, ''Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2003), p. 105. The only known communities in Wales were at [[Snowdon]] and [[Bardsey Island]] in north [[Wales]] in the days of [[Giraldus Cambrensis|Gerald of Wales]], mentioned (c. 1190) in ''Speculum Ecclesiae'' and ''Itinerarium'' respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the ninth century the ''clas'' was clearly the wealthiest in the province.&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Bowen, ''A History of Llanbadarn Fawr'' (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The renowned [[Asser]], scholar and adviser to [[Alfred the Great]], King of [[Wessex]], may have been educated at Llanbadarn Fawr.&lt;ref&gt;Nora Kershaw Chadwick, &quot;Intellectual life in West Wales in the Last Days of the Celtic Church&quot;, in Nora K. Chadwick, Kathleen Hughes, Christopher Brooke and Kenneth Jackson (eds), ''Studies in the Early British Church'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1958), pp. 121â€“82 at p. 124. Asser had been a monk at [[St David's Cathedral]] before he was invited to Alfred's court in about 885. He later became [[Bishop of Sherborne]]. See Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and other contemporary sources'' (Penguin Classics, New York, 2004); Richard Abels, ''Alfred the Great: War, Kingship and Culture in Anglo-Saxon England'' (Longman, New York 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; If this is correct it would be a strong indication that Llanbadarn's reputation for learning was well-founded.

===The Later Celtic period and the dominance of Sulien and his family===

Records become more certain by the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;This is primarily thanks to the ''scriptoria'' of monasteries.&lt;/ref&gt; Violence was endemic in medieval Europe, not excepting Wales. During the tenth and eleventh centuries the coasts of Wales were frequently raided by the [[Vikings]]. In 987/988 the ''clas'' was destroyed by the [[Danes]], but the worst to suffer was [[St Davids|St David's]], with attacks in 1073, 1080 and 1091. In 989 Maredudd ab Owain raised a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] to bribe the Danes to stay away from Llanbadarn (a [[tribute]] was levied of one [[penny]] for every man within his dominions, which, in Welsh, was called ''Glwmaen'', or the tribute of the black army).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lewis, ''A Topographical Dictionary of Wales'' (S. Lewis &amp; Co, London, 1833).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1038 the church was reduced to ashes by [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], who wrested it from the hands of prince Hywel ab Edwin, whilst subjugating Ceredigion. The lands were ravaged and the area depopulated, though the ''clas'' survived. Gruffydd ap Llywelyn seems to have held the area until his death in 1063.&lt;ref&gt;Gruffydd ap Llywelyn was known as King of the Britons. From 1055 until his death in 1063, he was ruler of all Wales â€“ an achievement unmatched by any other Welsh prince; [http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/WelshMonarchsandPrinces/GruffuddapLlywelyn.aspx/ &quot;Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (1055â€“1063)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

At this period the Llanbadarn community was dominated by [[Sulien]] (1011â€“91) and his remarkable family. Around 1055 [[Sulien]], who was born into a family educated for many generations in the ''clas'' monastic school or college of Llanbadarn Fawr, returned there after five years study in [[Scotland]] and ten years study in [[Ireland]] (according to his son and biographer). After this time Llanbadarn Fawr became possibly the foremost place of learning in Wales. Sulien went on to be known as Sulien the Wise. He became the [[abbot]] of Llanbadarn Fawr and served as [[Bishop of St David's]] twice. Under his abbacy Llanbadarn Fawr's [[monastery|monastic]] [[library]] grew in size and importance; reputedly larger than those of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Rees, ''Celtic Sites and Their Saints: A Guidebook'' (Bloomsbury Publishing, London, 2003), p. 105. Libraries, primarily in monasteries and cathedrals, were at the heart of the growth in knowledge during the [[Renaissance of the 12th century|Renaissance of the twelfth century]]; in 1212 the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is &quot;one of the chief works of mercy&quot;; George Haven Putnam, ''Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages'' (Hillary House, New York, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Sulien, now [[Bishop of St David's]] (he was bishop 1073â€“1078 and 1080â€“1086), himself took refuge at Llanbadarn Fawr from the Vikings who were raiding [[St Davids|St David's]].&lt;ref&gt;The Vikings were to attack St David's eleven times between 967 and 1091; Mark Redknap, &quot;Limits of Viking influence in Wales&quot; (December 1998) 40 British Archaeology 12â€“14.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the bishops were murdered by raiders and marauders, including Bishop Morgeneu I (also known as Morgenveth, Morgeney, Uregeneu) in 999 and Bishop Abraham (who had been newly elected to succeed Sulien) in 1080.

In the time of Sulien and his sons and grandsons the ''clas'' at Llanbadarn Fawr was an important ''[[scriptorium]]'' where texts were composed and copied. [[Rhygyfarch]] or Rhigyfarch, who was Sulien's eldest son, and may have succeeded him as [[bishop of St David's]] (after Sulien's second time in post), wrote, surely at his fatherâ€™s request, his ''Vita Davidis'' or ''Life of St David'' (later translated into Welsh as ''Buchedd Dewi'') c.1081 â€“ c.1090.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lapidge, &quot;The Welsh-Latin poetry of Sulien's family&quot; (1973â€“4) 8â€“9 Studia Celtica 68â€“106.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly the book was intended to promote the restoration of the damaged see, especially in the face of the Norman challenge. Rhygyfarch and his brother Ieuan were both fine poets in Latin. Ieuan copied manuscripts and composed poetry (Ieuan also wrote, in Welsh, a verse to Padarnâ€™s staff Cyrwen).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

At the same time, produced in Llanbadarn c.1079, the [[Ricemarch Psalter]]&lt;ref&gt;The psalter, now at Trinity College, Dublin as MS 50, includes the ''Letter of St. Jerome to Chromatius and Elidorus''; ''Breviarius Apostolorum''; ''Martyrologium Hieronymianum'', and Various Tables. Interestingly it shows Viking influence.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of only two surviving manuscripts certain to have be produced in Wales in the eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;The other is a manuscript of St. Augustine's ''De Trinitate'', now in Cambridge, by the same scribe. See, generally, See M. Lapidge, &quot;The Welsh-Latin poetry of Sulien's family&quot; (1973â€“4) 8â€“9 Studia Celtica 68â€“106 and Gillian Conway, &quot;Towards a cultural context for the eleventh-century Llanbadarn manuscripts&quot; (1997) 13(1) Ceredigion: Journal of the Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 9â€“28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Brut y Tywysogion'' (''The Chronicle of the Princes''), a Latin chronicle of events, which survives in Welsh translations, may have been written at [[Strata Florida Abbey]], it may have been kept in Llanbadarn in the eleventh century,&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Brut y Tywysogion'' generally, see Ian R. Jack, ''Medieval Wales'' (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; due to Llanbadarnâ€™s ''scriptorium'' and its reputation as a centre of learning.

In the late eleventh century the church in Wales began to come under [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] influence, but Llanbadarn Fawr still essentially belonged to a Welsh world, that of an early Welsh ''clas'', with its hereditary succession to the abbacy and its married clerics. The Church in Wales only gradually came under the influence of the see of Canterbury (and so of [[Pope|Rome]]) and even more slowly under its control. Wider political events however were to accelerate this.&lt;ref&gt;John Reuben Davies, &quot;Aspects of Church Reform in Wales, c.1093-c.1223&quot;, in ''Anglo-Norman Studies 30, Proceedings of the Battle Conference 2007'', edited by C. P. Lewis (Boydell, Woodbridge, 2008), pp. 85â€“99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Llanbadarn and the Normans===

The Normans arrived in Ceredigion in 1073â€“1074,&lt;ref&gt;''Brut y Tywysogion'' (''Chronicles of the Princes'') ed T. Jones (University of Press Press, Cardiff, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; and from the early twelfth century Norman political and ecclesiastical influence gradually increased, aided by the appointment, after 1115, of Norman bishops of St David's.&lt;ref&gt;The first, [[Bernard (bishop of St Davids)|Bernard]], appointed by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], was the last bishop to dispute the primacy of the [[see of Canterbury]]; David Walker, &quot;Bernard (d. 1148)&quot;, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In about the year 1106, Ithel and [[Madoc]], who were in alliance with King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], ravaged all the county of [[Ceredigion#History|Cardigan]], as Ceredigion was called by the Normans, with the exception of Llanbadarn Fawr and [[Llanddewi Brefi]]. Nevertheless, Llanbadarn Fawr suffered an attack upon its [[sanctuary]], from which several of Owain ab Madocâ€™s men, who had taken refuge there, were dragged out by force and put to death. But by this time, scarcely a generation after Rhygyfarch was writing his ''Life'' of St David, the ''clas'' had declined in its spiritual and pastoral life, and its political importance, although its financial position remained strong, due to the substantial revenues of its extensive lands.&lt;ref&gt;Even a century later the church was the richest in the diocese, with an annual revenue of 100 marks ([[pounds sterling|Â£]]66 13 s 4 d) at the time of the ''Taxatio Ecclesiastica Angliae et Walliae auctoritate P. Nicholai IV'' (Records Commission, London, 1802), p. 272, in 1291â€“1292; [http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/taxatio/benkey?benkey=DA.CG.UA.01/ &quot;Benefice of LLANBADARN FAWR&quot; in Taxatio]; cf. Sir John Edward Lloyd, (1931) Archaeologia Cambrensis, p. 202. For comparison, the next richest, [[Llandysul]], was worth Â£20 in 1291â€“1292.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1110, King Henry I took [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] from his appointee [[Owain ap Cadwgan]], son of [[Cadwgan ap Bleddyn]], ostensibly as punishment for a number of crimes including that of the rape and abduction of his cousin [[Nest ferch Rhys|Nest]], wife of [[Gerald de Windsor]] and [[Ward (law)|ward]] of King Henry I.&lt;ref&gt;John Davies, ''A History of Wales'' (Penguin Group, London, 1993), pp. 112â€“13. Nest was the only legitimate daughter of Rhys ap Tewdwr, last King of Deheubarth. This action incurred the wrath not only of the Normans but of those Welsh who had been victimised by Owain and his followers.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn Henry gave the [[Lordship]] of Cardigan (as the Normans called Ceredigion), including [[Cardigan Castle]], to [[Gilbert fitz Richard]], [[Earl of Clare]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CPIII243&quot;&gt;George Edward Cokayne, ''The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant'', Vol III, Ed. Vicary Gibbs (The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., London, 1913), p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; who imposed a string of castles through the lordship.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert was given an area with one major castle at Cardigan already in use, but with the hinterland little explored. He secured Cardigan and established himself at Aberystwyth (not the later Edwardian stronghold) and commissioned a number of castles, some of which bore or came to bear Welsh names, while others were identified by the name of their Norman [[Castellans]]. They included: Walter's Castle, Razo's Castle, Lampeter Castle (also known as Stephen's Castle), Humphrey's Castle (later rebuilt as Castell Hywel), Richard's Castle, Blaenporth (also known as Ralph's Castle); David Walker, ''Medieval Wales'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

As potent as the military power of the Normans from the 1070s were the ideas and practices introduced into Wales, particularly in the sphere of ecclesiastical affairs; these were adopted and adapted by the native elites.&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Introduction: The Welsh cathedrals 1066â€“1300&quot;, in M.J. Pearson (ed), ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066â€“1300: Volume 9, the Welsh Cathedrals (Bangor, Llandaff, St Asaph, St Davids)'' (Institute of Historical Research, London, 2003), pp. xixâ€“xxiv http://www.british-history.ac.uk/fasti-ecclesiae/1066-1300/vol9/xix-xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The short-lived Benedictine priory===

Between 1111 and 1117&lt;ref&gt;The letters connected with the grant of Llanbadarn by Gilbert Fitz Richard are to be found in the ''Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Sancti Petri Gloucestriae'' ed. W.H. Hart (HMSO, London, 1863), vol II, pp. 73â€“9. Some of these are of doubtful authenticity. There is also a brief statement of the monastery's rights over Llanbadarn included in a long list of donations of other lands and churches, vol I, p. 106: ''De Sancto Paterno in Wallia. Anno Domini millesimo centesimo undecimo, Gilbertus filius Ricardi, unus de praecipuis Angliae principibus, dedit ecclesiae Sancti Petri Gloucestriae terram et ecclesiam Sancti Paterni in Wallia, et omnia quae ad earn pertinent inter divisiones maris et duarum aquarum, et medietatem magnae piscaturae quam fecit, et decimas omnium rerum de suo dominio appendentium ad castellum suum de Penwediche.'' This can be roughly translated as &quot;Of St Padern in Wales: The year of our Lord one thousand one hundred and eleven, Gilbert fitz Richard, one of the most important the nobles of England, gave to the Church of Saint Peter of Gloucester, the lands in Wales belonging to St Padarn's church, between the parts of the sea, and everything belonging to it, and all of the waters of the two, and midst of the great fishing that he wrought, of the weight of a tenth part of all things from his dominion to his castle of Penweddig&quot;. Penweddig would be the early castle is built near Tanybwlch, south of the Ystwyth, to strengthen the power of King Henry I in the area (Aberystwyth Castle dates from a century later). This note would have us believe that the earl's grant was made in 1111. Sir John Edward Lloyd has argued, ''History of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, 1911), vol II, pp. 432â€“3 n, the true date is more probably 1116-7. This is explained by Brooke. The gift is dated 1111 in the index, but the charter of Gilbert (who died in or before 1117; George Edward Cokayne, ''The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant'', Vol III, Ed. Vicary Gibbs (The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., London, 1913), p. 243) is witnessed by Bishop Bernard, who was consecrated 1115. He suggests that the ''clas'' was granted 1111 and confirmed by charter some time between Bernard's accession and Gilbert's death. He does note, however, that Bernard does not appear in what may well be an early version of the grant, incorporated in Henry I's ''pancarte'' attributed to 1114; Christopher Brooke, &quot;St Peter of Gloucester and St Cadoc of Llancarfan&quot;, in Matthias McD. Bodkin (ed), ''Celtic and Saxon'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1914), pp. 258â€“322, at 264â€“5, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; the ancient ''clas'' church was granted by Gilbert fitz Richard to [[Gloucester Cathedral|St Peter's Abbey]], [[Gloucester]] (a [[Benedictine]] [[Monastery|house]]),&lt;ref&gt;Many of these early ''clasau'' were granted as endowments to the monasteries, particularly those of the [[Augustinians]], founded by the [[Normans]] and the [[Welsh kingdoms|Welsh Princes]]. The church at [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] was granted to Gloucester Abbey at around the same time; Janet Burton and Karen StÃ¶ber (eds), ''Abbeys and Priorities of Medieval Wales'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2015), p. 110; R. Neville Hadcock and David Knowles, ''Medieval Religious Houses, England and Wales'' (Harlow, London, 1971), pp. 55, 69; ''Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Sancti Petri Gloucestriae'' ed. W.H. Hart (Rolls Series, London, 1863â€“1867), vol. 1, pp. 73â€“9, 106. Other ''clasau'' became parish churches.&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Monastic cell|cell]] or [[priory]] of St Peter's Abbey. This may have meant the construction of a stone church, perhaps the first on the site; a new tower and porch were built.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nora Kershaw Chadwick 1958 pp. 162-4&quot;&gt;Nora Kershew Chadwick, &quot;Intellectual life in West Wales in the Last Days of the Celtic Church&quot;, in Nora K. Chadwick, Kathleen Hughes, Christopher Brooke and Kenneth Jackson (eds), ''Studies in the Early British Church'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1958), pp. 162â€“4, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the Celtic monks and priests (married and single) were expelled, or whether they were joined by brethren of a new sort.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Burton, &quot;Transition and Transformation: the Benedictine Houses&quot;, in Janet Burton and Karen StÃ¶ber (eds), ''Monastic Wales: New Approaches'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2013), pp. 21â€“3, at p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, in 1141, [[Ewenny Priory]], in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], was founded as a [[priory]] of [[Gloucester Cathedral|St Peter's Abbey]], [[Gloucester]]. As with Llanbadarn, there was a pre-existing church, in this case definitely one in stone, and probably dating from the 1120s, as it was consecrated 1126 by Bishop [[Urban (bishop of Llandaff)|Urban]] of [[Bishop of Llandaff|Llandaff]].

The monks were in residence for scarcely twenty years. Llanbadarn would have been a simple or obedientiary priory, a dependency of the abbey. The superior of such a priory, who was subject to the abbot in everything, was called a &quot;prior.&quot; These monasteries were satellites of the mother abbey. In light of earlier activities at Llanbadarn, it is worth noting that the forty-eighth rule of Saint Benedict prescribes extensive and habitual holy reading for the brethren.&lt;ref&gt;Esther De Waal, ''A Life Giving Way: A Commentary on the Rule of St Benedict'' (A. &amp; C. Black, London, 2006), pp. 140â€“5; Nirmal Kaur, ''History of Education'' (Mittal Publications, New Delhi, 2005), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Benedictine monks were disallowed worldly possessions, thus necessitating the preservation and collection of sacred texts in monastic libraries for communal use.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Wormald and C.E. Wright, ''The English Library before 1700'' (The Athlone Press, London, 1958), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key Benedictine practices was copying sacred texts, so it might be expected that the monks created a ''scriptorium'', if indeed one hadn't survived from the time of Sulien and his sons and grandsons.

Benedictine monastic life at Llanbadarn Fawr was short-lived. First the princes of [[Gwynedd]] and then those of [[Deheubarth]] expelled the Normans, driving the English monks away when they re-conquered Ceredigion in 1136, after a victory against the Normans at [[Battle of Crug Mawr|Crug Mawr]], following the death of King Henry I in 1135.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald of Wales, ''Itinerarium Cambriae''. Lewis notes that the account of the ''clas'' being restored in 1136 conflicts with the evidence of the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the [[Justiciar]], at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326. In this, the jury declared that Gloucester had peacefully held the church until 20 May 1212, when the two monks having charge of the church were murdered. Lewis, however, prefers the account of Gerald (which has the ''clas'' community alone occupying the church) to that of the later inquisition; Frank Lewis, &quot;The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages&quot; (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15â€“40 at pp. 17â€“18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of events over the next 45 years. However, it seems likely that the Celtic monks returned to their old ''clas''.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the priory, see F.G. Cowley, ''The monastic order in South Wales, 1066â€“1349'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1977); Martin Heale, ''The Dependent Priories of Medieval English Monasteries'' (Boydell and Brewer, Woodbridge, 2004) Studies in the History of Medieval Religion, 22; Brian Golding, 'Trans-border transactions: patterns of patronage in Anglo-Norman Wales', Haskins Society Journal, 16, ed. S. Morillo &amp; D. Korngiebel (Woodbridge, 2006), pp. 27â€“46; Sir John Edward Lloyd, ''History of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, 1911), vol II, pp. 432â€“3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The restored ''clas'' in transition===

The church seems to have been restored as a ''clas'' or re-founded as a college of [[Secular clergy|secular priests]] (a [[collegiate church]]) before 1144, but the heyday of the ''clas'' churches had passed. Gloucester Abbey tried to recover the church in 1175 and again in 1251, and even appealed to the Pope, but without success.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Burton and Karen StÃ¶ber (eds), ''Abbeys and Priorities of Medieval Wales'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2015), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient ''clas'' establishment seems to have re-emerged from the brief period of the priory, for mention occurs in the Welsh annals, in the year 1137, of the death of John (Ieuan),&lt;ref&gt;M'S 199 in the Parker Library of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], contains a fragmentary late eleventh-century copy of the monumental treatise ''De Trinitate'' by [[St Augustine of Hippo]]. The [[National Library of Wales]] possesses a photographic facsimile of a small part of the manuscript (NLW Facsimile 196). CCCC 199 is the work of the scribal artist Ieuan ap Sulien, who both copied the text of Augustine's treatise and vigorously decorated it with over 150 coloured initials in a version of Irish [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] interlace style. Francoise Henry stated that Ieuan was &quot;the scribe and probably also the painter, of CCCC 199&quot; (&quot;Remarks on the decoration of three Irish psalters&quot; (1960) 61C Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy pp. 23â€“40, at p. 39). The close interrelationship between the initials and the text of the manuscript, the stylistic match between the decoration of CCCC 199 and Ieuan's artistic work in the Psalter and Martyrology made for his brother Rhigyfarch, and Ieuan's failure, in his concluding poem in CCCC 199, to mention anyone other than himself as having had a hand in producing the manuscript, establish that the initials are his work. See Timothy Graham, &quot;The poetic, scribal, and artistic work of Ieuan ap Sulien in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 199: addenda and assessment&quot; (1996) 29(3) National Library of Wales Journal 241â€“256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[archpriest|arch-priest]] or [[archdeacon]] of Llanbadarn, who could have been none other than Ieuan ap Sulien, of the great line of Sulien.&lt;ref&gt;Nora Kershaw Chadwick, &quot;Intellectual life in West Wales in the Last Days of the Celtic Church&quot;, in Nora K. Chadwick, Kathleen Hughes, Christopher Brooke and Kenneth Jackson (eds), ''Studies in the Early British Church'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1958), pp. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In the twelfth century ''clas'' churches were led by an [[abbot|''abod'']] with clergy under an &quot;archpresbyter&quot; (''archoffeiriad'').&lt;ref&gt;Morgan emphasises the revived use of the title &quot;arch-priest&quot;; Gerald Morgan, ''Ceredigion: A wealth of History'' (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 99. However chantries in religious communities were sometimes headed by a warden or [[archpriest]]; D. Crouch, &quot;The Origins of the Chantry: Some Further Anglo-Norman Evidence,&quot; (2001) 27 Journal of Medieval History 159-80. An archpriest might also be senior priest, responsible for a number of parishes. One archpriest still exists in Britain, at [[Coffinswell|Haccombe]]. This is a small hamlet in [[Devon]]. Its small [[chapel]] is dedicated to [[Saint Blaise]]. The benefice is occupied by an incumbent with the title of [[Archpriest]]. The archpresbytery was established in 1341 with six clergy: only the archpriest survived at the [[Reformation]].{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QohMZrmjbYsC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=archpriest+haccombe+exeter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FX8dDc--NZ&amp;sig=QAxpql3d8uoE82IzTYeiOX47DuI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RqUtSq_rLomsjAep27XiCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA302,M1|title=Will of Archpriest of Haccombe|first=John|last=Carnell|accessdate=2009-06-09}}. The parish is now combined with that of [[Stokeinteignhead|Stoke-in-Teignhead]] with [[Combeinteignhead|Combe-in-Teignhead]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same record, in the year 1146, the death of Sulien ab Rhygyfarch, &quot;a man of great knowledge, and one of the college of Llanbadarn&quot;, is noted. By this time, after the loss of the Gloucester link, the church was again in the hands of a [[lay abbot]]; the use of the title abbot did not mean that the church was an [[abbey]].

But despite the continuity â€“ or perhaps because of it â€“ all was apparently not well. In 1188 [[Gerald of Wales]] accompanied [[Baldwin of Forde]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], on a tour of Wales, the primary object being a recruitment campaign for the [[Third Crusade]], a secondary one to establish his authority over the whole Welsh church. Geraldâ€™s vivid account of the journey is the first great European travel book. Gerald visited Llanbadarn Fawr,&lt;ref&gt;Accompanied by the abbots of Whitland and Strata Florida; Jemma Bezant, &quot;Travel and communication&quot; in Janet Burton and Karen StÃ¶ber (eds), ''Monastic Wales: New Approaches'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2013), pp. 133â€“146, at p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; and described the college of [[secular canons]] under a [[lay abbot]] (Ednowain &quot;bishop of Llanbadarn&quot;), in not especially flattering terms; it should be remembered that Gerald was a zealous reformer, critical of anything of which he disapproved, as he did of Llanbadarn: the abbot was described as &quot;a certain old man, waxen old in iniquity&quot;. The account of his visit was subsequently published in the ''[[Itinerarium Cambriae]]'' (1191),&lt;ref&gt;Gerald of Wales, ''The Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales'' trans. Lewis Thorpe (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by the ''[[Descriptio Cambriae]]'' in 1194.

Gerald tells us further that a [[Breton people|Breton]] [[knight]] had come to the church for [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and found a band of about twenty young men, all armed and equipped according to the local custom. He asked &quot;which was the abbot, and they pointed out to him a man with a long spear in his hand, who was walking in front of the others&quot;. He then tells the story of the murder of a bishop of Llanbadarn, murdered by the predecessors of the present generation of clergy. We cannot be sure how much of this was true. But Gerald disapproved of married clergy (which had been declining generally though only finally abolished by Rome in the eleventh century&lt;ref&gt;By [[Gregorian Reforms|Gregory VII]]; H.E.J. Cowdrey, ''The Register of Pope Gregory VII 1073â€“1085: An English Translation'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and deplored in principle the inheritance of church office. But all he tells us of Llanbadarn is hearsay, apart from the name of the abbot. In any case, no move was made by Archbishop Baldwin in favour of reform: the [[Rhys ap Gruffydd|Lord Rhys]]&lt;ref&gt;Rhys ap Gruffydd, Prince of Deheubarth, at this time [[Justiciar of South Wales]] for King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]].&lt;/ref&gt; was with them, and they would not have wished to offend him. In any event, it would have been a matter for the [[Bishop of St David's]], who was [[Peter de Leia]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter de Leia was appointed by King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] as bishop, despite the preference of the [[cathedral chapter]] for Gerald himself. Besides his rivalry with Gerald, de Leia had a stormy relationship with Rhys ap Gruffydd, Prince of Deheubarth. After de Leia's death in 1198, the chapter was again refused permission to elect Gerald, and the see remained vacant for six years.&lt;/ref&gt; There is then no further information about Llanbadarn for nearly sixty years.

===The decline of the ''clas'' or college===

[[File:Strata Florida Abbey (9474519190).jpg|thumb|Strata Florida Abbey, the Cistercian house that was to attract patronage from the princes away from Llanbadarn]]

The Normans briefly returned to power in the 1160s, and before Rhys ap Gruffudd expelled them c.1189 they had begun the foundation of the [[Cistercian]] abbey at [[Strata Florida Abbey|Strata Florida]], carried on by Rhys. The Cistercians enjoyed great prestige in Wales, and Llanbadarn Fawr was eclipsed as a centre of Welsh culture. The monks took over the ''Chronicle of the Princes'' and began the copying of major Welsh manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;D.H. Williams, &quot;The White Monks in Powys II: Strata Florida&quot; (1976) 11 Cistercian Studies 155â€“191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angle of north west wall, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|Angle of north transept and nave west wall]]

Welsh rule was briefly interrupted in 1211 when royal forces again seized Aberystwyth, but control was soon regained by the Welsh under the aegis of [[Llywelyn the Great]], and so it remained until Welsh power collapsed in 1246. Between 1231 and 1247 the church was divided between Gloucester Abbey and St David's Cathedral, with the requirement of the provision of a vicarage (that is, a living for a vicar),&lt;ref&gt;''St Davids Episcopal Acta 1085â€“1280'' ed [[Julia Barrow]] (South Wales Record Society, Cardiff, 1998), pp. 116â€“17.&lt;/ref&gt; but it had passed to the Crown by 1251.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of Patent Rolls 1247â€“1258'' (HMSO, London, 1908), p. 88: &quot;Presentation of Peter de Abusun, King's kinsman, to the church of Lampadarmaur, void by the confirmation of the election of Master L. de Sancto Martino to the church of Rochester; directed to the bishop of St Davids&quot; (28 February, Westminster).&lt;/ref&gt; If there was a vicarage at the time of the taxatio, it was perhaps the individual rector who presented to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/taxatio/benkey?benkey=DA.CG.UA.01/ &quot;Benefice of LLANBADARN FAWR&quot; in Taxatio].&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] appropriated the [[advowson]] of the church, when he seized the lands of Maelgwn ap Maelgwn, called Maelgwn Fychan, the son of [[Maelgwn ap Rhys]], possibly to help pay the construction costs of the new church, though the seizure was contrary to the Gloucester Abbey claims and Gilbert fitz Richard's charters.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lewis, &quot;The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages&quot; (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15â€“40, at p. 17; Sir John Edward Lloyd, ''The Story of Ceredigion 400â€“1277'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937), pp. 34â€“35. In 1242 the king had explicitly said that the church belonged to St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, and granted royal protection without term in a mandate addressed to Maredudd ab Owain, Maelgwn ap Maelgwn, Rhys ap Rhys, and all bailiffs and ministers of south Wales; ''Calendar of Close Rolls, 1242â€“1247'', p. 279; Sir John Edward Lloyd, ''The Story of Ceredigion 400â€“1277'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1937), pp. 87â€“91;  Sir John Edward Lloyd, ''History of Wales from the earliest times to the Edwardian conquest'' (Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, 1911), vol II, pp. 637â€“8. After the appropriation the king ordered an inquiry (1247) into the [[Alienation (property law)|alienation]] of lands from the church; ''Calendar of Close Rolls, 1242â€“1247'' ed Sir Henry Maxwell-Lyte (HMSO, London, 1916), vol 5, pp. 545â€“6;&lt;/ref&gt; Henry IIIâ€™s officials controlled Aberystwyth, and it was probably then that the building of the present church began.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Morgan, ''Ceredigion: A wealth of History'' (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; That it was a royal project is suggested by the very size of the building. The advowson â€“ or right of presentation â€“ was to remain in the hands of the [[monarch|Crown]] from 1246 to 1360,&lt;ref&gt;F.R. Lewis, &quot;The Rectors of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire, from 1246 to 1360&quot; (1937) 92 Archaeologia Cambrensis 233â€“246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was now under a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], who replaced the lay abbot;&lt;ref&gt;Roughly speaking, the distinction between rector and vicar was that a rector directly received both the greater and lesser [[tithes]] of his parish while a vicar received only the lesser tithes (the greater tithes going to the lay holder, or ''[[impropriation|impropriator]]'', of the living). In this case the rector kept both 1246â€“1360; when Vale Royal Abbey appropriated the church in 1359/60 the rector was replaced by a vicar, who received only the lesser tithes â€“ and after the Reformation not even those. Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, ''The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation'' (Longmans, London, 1810). Initially it had not been unusual for religious houses in possession of rectories also to assume the capability to collect tithe and [[glebe]] income for themselves, but this practice was banned by the decrees of the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] of 1215. Thereafter, over the mediaeval period, monasteries and priories continually sought papal exemption from the Council's decrees, so as to appropriate the income of rectoral benefices to their own use. However, from the thirteenth century onwards, diocesan bishops successfully established the principle that only the glebe and &quot;greater tithes&quot; of grain, hay and wood could be appropriated by monastic patrons in this manner; the &quot;lesser tithes&quot; had to remain within the parochial benefice; the incumbent of which thenceforward carried the title of &quot;vicar&quot;; David Knowles, ''The Religious Orders in England, Vol II'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1955), p.290.&lt;/ref&gt; and any remaining priests of the ''clas'' and their ''[[abod]]'' were presumably expelled. If one accepts the evidence of the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the [[Justiciar]], at [[Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn]], 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lewis, &quot;The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages&quot; (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15â€“40 at pp. 17â€“18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is difficult to see how they can have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest).

Despite the splendidly sized new building (albeit a plain one), the church declined in status as the college gradually died. It is possible that the community ceased in 1212, when the Gloucester monks were killed by the locals; we don't know whether they were replaced. Nor do we know whether the ''clas'' resumed after Llywelyn the Great retook the area. Community life probably ended with the appointment of a rector by King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1246,&lt;ref&gt;Bishop Basil Jones, writing in 1856, stated that &quot;The church of Llanbarn-fawr, after the cessation of the episcopate, retained something of a coenobitic or collegiate character to at least the beginning of the thirteenth century, in spite of an attempt at the commencement of the twelfth to appropriate its revenues to the Abbey of Gloucester&quot;. He noted further, that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; as to &quot;how long the church retained its collegiate constitution, but it must have done so beyond the middle of the thirteenth century, when the present fabric was erected, and may have done so until the appropriation of its revenue to Vale-Royal in 1360&quot;; W.B. Jones and E.A. Freeman, ''The history and antiquities of Saint David's'' (J.H. &amp; J. Parker, London, 1856), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; although this latter is not conclusive; a college might be headed by a rector, although they were usually styled provost.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a collegiate church with a rector in charge, see Lowthorpe Collegiate Church (no. 201) in ''A History of the County of York'' (Victoria County Histories, London, 1974), vol 3, pp. 359â€“75. This college, which was founded in 1333, had a rector and six perpetual priests (those who were permanently appointed to a [[cure of souls|cure]] rather than temporarily attached to a church or chapel), assisted by three clerks, of whom two were to deacons (or one a deacon and the other a sub-deacon).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been suggestions that there were one or more [[chantry]] chapels,&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, Â£1979), pp. 55â€“56 (a guild chapel); W. Gwyn Thomas, &quot;The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church&quot; (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127â€“129 (the doors in the chancel being survivors of the entrance to a [[chantry]] chapel rather than a rood loft). Crouch points to the parallel development of communities or colleges of secular priests or canons as an influence on the evolution of the chantry. Such communities were not monastic foundations, although members shared a common life. Like the monasteries, they offered dedicated prayers for the dead; D. Crouch, &quot;The Origins of the Chantry: Some Further Anglo-Norman Evidence,&quot; (2001) 27 Journal of Medieval History 159-80.&lt;/ref&gt; which could suggest the presence of more than one priest.

Surprisingly, perhaps, the [[tithes]] were administered locally by a Welshman, Gwilym ap Gwrwared, who was probably grandfather of famed bard [[Dafydd ap Gwilym|Dafydd]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Morgan, ''Ceredigion: A wealth of History'' (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was said to have been rebuilt, after serious fire damage, around 1257â€“1265, though whether this was a rebuilding, or a continuation of work commenced after 1246, is unclear. It is not inconceivable that the fire damage was caused when, in 1256, [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd|Llywelyn ap Gruffydd]], with a large army, seized Llanbadarn Fawr from Norman control. [[Edmund Crouchback|Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster]], son of King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and brother of King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], was Lord of Cardigan from 1265. Given the size of the church it is probable that construction took many years, even if it were not interrupted. If it commenced in 1246 it is quite conceivable that work was not complete until 1265, or later.

The rectors were almost all royal favourites or up-and-coming ecclesiastical leaders, who would have rarely visited the church.&lt;ref&gt;Given the size of the parish a single priest would have been insufficient. In 1548 Llanbadarn church had two priests assisting the vicar; J.T. Evans, ''The Church Plate of Cardiganshire. With the Chantry Certificates Relating to the County of Cardigan By the Commissioners Of 2 Edward VI (1548); Extracts from the Returns of Church Goods in 6 &amp; 7 Edward VI (1552â€“1553); Notes on Registers, Bells Etc.'' (James J. Alden, London, 1914), pp. 8â€“9.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most notable of the rectors at this time was [[Antony Bek (bishop of Durham)|Antony Bek]], who held the living from 1277â€“84. He was brother to [[Thomas Bek (bishop of St David's)|Thomas Bek]], bishop of St Davidâ€™s 1280â€“93. Antony Bek became [[bishop of Durham]] and [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]],&lt;ref&gt;He was (titular) Latin Patriarch 1306â€“1311. Acre had been lost in 1291, and the patriarchate moved to Cyprus then Rome after 1374.&lt;/ref&gt; but was more noted as a warrior than for his piety.&lt;ref&gt;See C.M. Fraser, ''A History of Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham 1283â€“1311'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

Llanbadarn Fawr was the focus of the [[England|English]] forces assembled in south Wales against the insurrection of Rhys ab Meredydd in 1287. By this time the rector was invariably an absentee [[clergy|cleric]]; John de Camera, Rector 1329â€“1334 was also canon of [[St David's Cathedral|St David's]], [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]] and [[Abergwili#Bishop's Palace|Abergwili]], and was a government clerk. Then, as now, such a large and remote charge invited [[Benefice#Pluralism|pluralism]] and non-residence.&lt;ref&gt;John Morgan-Guy and William Gibson (eds), ''Religion and Society in the Diocese of St Davids 1485â€“2011'' (Ashgate, 2015), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; There was, at this time, a comparatively small amount in [[tithes]], but the rector was nonetheless equivalent in substance to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by [[Frankalmoin]] [[Land tenure|tenure]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lewis, &quot;The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages&quot; (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15â€“40, at p.25; 'Pleas and evidences: Fos.69â€“89, fo. 89', in ''The Ledger Book of Vale Royal Abbey'', ed. John Brownbill (Manchester, 1914), pp. 149â€“166 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/lancs-ches-record-soc/vol68/pp149-166 [accessed 23 April 2015]. Frankalmoin tenure meant that an ecclesiastical body held land free of military service such as [[knight service]] or other secular or religious service, but sometimes in return for the religious service of saying prayers and masses for the soul of the grantor. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries jurisdiction over land held belonged to the ecclesiastical courts, and was thus immune from royal jurisdiction. There is no record of such an ecclesiastical court at Llanbadarn. Frankalmoign(e) was also known as &quot;tenure in free alms&quot;. Gifts to religious institutions in free alms were defined first as gifts to God, then to the [[patron saint]] of the religious house, and finally to those religious serving God in the specific house. Frankalmoin was the tenure by which the greater number of the monasteries and religious houses held their lands. It was expressly exempted from the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]], by which the other ancient tenures were abolished, and it was the tenure by which the parochial clergy and many ecclesiastical and eleemosynary foundations held their lands through the nineteenth century. As a form of donation, frankalmoin fell into disuse because on any alienation of the land the tenure was converted into [[socage]]. An apparent attempt was made to abolish frankalmoin in the [[Administration of Estates Act 1925]]; but in any case no fresh grants in frankalmoin, save by the Crown, were possible after [[Quia Emptores]] in 1290; Edward H. Burn, John Cartwright and Geoffrey C. Cheshire, ''Cheshire and Burn's modern law of real property'' (Oxford University Press, London, 18th edition, 2011), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

From this period we also have the first record of a [[baptism]], of William Knovill, son of John Knovill, King's Bailiff in Aberystwyth, in 1286.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Goronwy Edwards, ''Calendar of Ancient Correspondence concerning Wales'' (University Press Board, Cardiff, 1935), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Doubtless the surviving twelfth century [[Baptismal font|font]] was used.

===The later mediaeval period and the end of conventual life===

The [[College (canon law)|college]] survived until it disappeared or was dissolved, certainly before 1361â€“1362, and probably as early as 1246 or even 1212 (as mentioned above).

In 1346 William Kilsby, rector, died,&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of Patent Rolls 1358â€“1361'' (HMSO, London, 1911), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] gave the advowson to his eldest son, the [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]]. The latter made three presentations. One of these was to [[Thomas Bradwardine]], later briefly [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Llanbadarn Fawr 1347â€“1349.

The parish continued largely if not wholly a sinecure for its rector, with the work actually done by a resident vicar; in Bradwardine's case he was concurrently prebend and the [[dean of Lincoln]],&lt;ref&gt;John de Ufford, Bradwardine's predecessor as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was also previously Dean of Lincoln; both were carried away by the [[Black Death]], in de Ufford's case, before he was consecrated; E.B. Fryde, D.E. Greenway, S. Porter and I. Roy, ''Handbook of British Chronology'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 3rd rev.Ã— ed., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chaplain]] and [[confessor]] to the King, and probably never visited Llanbadarn Fawr.&lt;ref&gt;Bradwardine preached at the victory Mass after the [[Battle of CrÃ©cy]] in 1346, and died of the plague in 1349, only forty days after being consecrated archbishop; Norman F. Cantor, &quot;Death comes to the Archbishop&quot;, in ''In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World it Made'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, New York, 2001), pp. 103â€“124. Although there were several competing theories as to the [[Etiology (medicine)|etiology]] of the Black Death, analysis of DNA from victims in northern and southern Europe published in 2010 and 2011 indicates that the [[pathogen]] responsible was the ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' bacterium, probably causing several forms of [[Plague (disease)|plague]]; S. Haensch, R. Bianucci, M. Signoli, M. Rajerison, M. Schultz, S. Kacki, M. Vermunt, D.A. Weston, D. Hurst, M. Achtman, E. Carniel and B. Bramanti, &quot;Distinct clones of Yersinia pestis caused the black death&quot; (2010) 6(10) PLoS Pathog. e1001134; K.I. Bos, V.J. Schuenemann, G.B. Golding, H.A. Burbano, N. Waglechner, B.K.

Krause, &quot;A draft genome of Yersinia pestis from victims of the Black Death&quot; (12 October 2011) 478(7370) Nature 506â€“10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the church continued to be rich, most of the rectors were well connected clerics, some, like Bradwardine, with distinguished careers. Others were less august â€“ or respectable. One of the rectors, [[Robert de Stretton|Robert Stretton]], who may have succeeded Bradwardine, and was in post by 1353, was nominated [[Bishop of Lichfield|Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield]] in 1359. His appointment was however (unsuccessfully) opposed by the Archbishop of Canterbury on the grounds that Stretton could neither read nor write&lt;ref&gt;F.R. Lewis, &quot;The Rectors of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire, from 1246 to 1360&quot; (1937) 92 Archaeologia Cambrensis 233â€“246, 244; C. Pap. Lett. 1342â€“1362, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; â€“ a charge that may well have been politically motivated and may have been untrue. [[Henry Wharton|Wharton]] included in ''Anglia Sacra'' a continuation of the history of Lichfield by William Whitlocke, which describes Stretton as &quot;eximius vir&quot; â€“ an exceptional man â€“ and goes on to make probably exaggerated claims for his attainments in [[jurisprudence]]. Bradwardine was a formidable scholar; Stretton may have been of a more practical bent â€“ he was concurrently [[Castellan|Constable]] of [[Aberystwyth Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;''Black Prince's Register'', III, pp. 378, 492; W.G.D. Fletcher, ''Dictionary of National Biography'', LV pp. 47â€“48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tradition has it that [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]], one of the greatest of Welsh poets, was born at Brogynin, [[Penrhyncoch]] (at the time in [[Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion|Llanbadarn Fawr]] parish, and now part of the grouped benefice), early in the fourteenth century, when the parish covered the whole of northern Ceredigion. Dafydd records a number of local place-names in his poetry. He is also known for his connection with Strata Florida, thanks to the story that he was buried there, and to the copying of his poetry into Strata Florida manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Fulton, ''Dafydd ap Gwilym and the European context'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1359 the Black Prince gave the advowson to four patrons (or feofees), who, on 7 November 1360 appropriated the church to the [[Cistercian]] [[Vale Royal Abbey]],&lt;ref name=&quot;british-history.ac.uk&quot;&gt;A.P. Baggs, Ann J. Kettle, S.J. Lander, A.T. Thacker and David Wardle, &quot;Houses of Cistercian monks: The abbey of Vale Royal&quot;, in C.R. Elrington and B.E. Harris (eds), ''A History of the County of Chester: Volume 3'' (Victoria County History, London, 1980), pp. 156â€“165 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/ches/vol3/pp156-165 [accessed 16 April 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chester]], founded by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1270.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of Patent Rolls 1358â€“1361'' (HMSO, London, 1911), P. 296; ''Calendar of Papal Registers Relating To Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 4, 1362â€“1404'', ed.

The timing could not have been better for the Vale Royal community, for in a storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the unfinished nave of their abbey church collapsed,&lt;ref&gt;This was ironic when one considers the origins of the abbey. In 1263 Prince Edward, the future [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], prior to his accession to the throne, was undertaking a sea voyage from France when his ship was caught in a terrible storm. He then made a vow that if he came safe to land he would found an abbey of unprecedented size and grandeur as a thanksgiving to God for saving him; G.D. Holland, J.N. Hickson, R. Hurst Vose. J.E. Challinor, ''Vale Royal Abbey and House'' (Winsford Local History Society, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; and rebuilding could not have been funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full.&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Baggs, Ann J. Kettle, S J. Lander, A. T. Thacker and David Wardle, &quot;Houses of Cistercian monks: The abbey of Vale Royal&quot;, in C.R. Elrington and B.E. Harris (eds), ''A History of the County of Chester: Volume 3'' (Victoria County History, London, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with the appropriation by the feofees, was too soon after the storm to realistically have been in response to that event. Given that the abbey was already â€“ and remained â€“ in debt, the reason for the appropriation was probably related to that.&lt;ref&gt;Vale Royal was often notorious for its misgovernment. The General Chapter, the international governing body of the Cistercian order, in 1455, ordered senior abbots to investigate the abbey, which they described as &quot;damnable and sinister&quot;; G.D. Holland, J.N. Hickson, R. Hurst Vose and J. E. Challinor, ''Vale Royal Abbey and House'' (Winsford Local History Society, 1977); F. A. Latham (ed.), ''Vale Royal'' (The Local History Group, Whitchurch, 1993); David Robinson, Janet Burton, Nicola Coldstream, Glyn Coppack Richard Fawcett, ''The Cistercian Abbeys of Britain'' (Batsford, London, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest of the church to be maintained by the parish.

The change in control was not without dispute, however, with both Vale Royal Abbey and St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester claiming the valuable church [[advowson]]. Legal action dragged on for some years, before Vale Royal Abbey ultimately prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;In 1363 Vale Royal Abbey appealed to [[Pope Urban V]] to &quot;solicit the ratification, confirmation and corroboration of the union, annexation and appropriation of the parish church of Lampadern in the diocese of St. David's, canonically united and appropriated to us and our monastery by the diocesan of the place&quot; 'Pleas and evidences: Fos.69â€“89, fo. 75', in ''The Ledger Book of Vale Royal Abbey'', ed. John Brownbill (Manchester Record Society, Manchester, 1914), pp. 149â€“166 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/lancs-ches-record-soc/vol68/pp149-166 [accessed 23 April 2015]; &quot;Abbot of Vale Royal to the King and Council in Parliament, seeking a remedy against the Abbot of Gloucester over the advowson of Llanbadarn Fawr, 1388&quot; ([[National Archives]], SC 8/27/1349); &quot;Petition of the Abbot of the Church of St Peter of Gloucester to the King and Council in present Parliament, 1388&quot; ([[National Archives]], SC 8/113/5633) â€“ the latter referring to the advowson of the church of St Peterne in Llanbadarn Fawr.&lt;/ref&gt; Control was also challenged by the Crown itself in 1398, and by Strata Florida Abbey in 1435. Vale Royal found keeping the appropriated church difficult, with the locals being at times difficult (for reasons that were not hard to discover).&lt;ref&gt;''Calendar of Close Rolls, 1396â€“1399'' (HMSO, London, 1927), pp. 273â€“4, 412; ''Calendar of Close Rolls, 1429â€“1435'' (HMSO, London, 1933), p. 364; ''Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1396â€“1399'' (HMSO, London, 1927), pp. 355, 513; ''Rotulae Parliamentariae'' v. 43; P.R.O., SC 8/145/7218.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The extension of the chancel under Vale Royal Abbey===

Even though it was subordinate to Vale Royal Abbey, the church at Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right. The building was actually substantially extended in 1475, with the construction of a large new sanctuary. There was also a [[Rood screen]] and [[Rood screen|loft]], with a carved image of Christ [[Crucifixion in the arts|crucified]], with the figures of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[John the Evangelist|St John]] either side, though this is now gone, although the steps to the loft may still be seen to the north side of the chancel.

[[File:Monuments in chancel, and entrance to roof loft, Llanbadarn Fawr church.jpg|thumb|Monuments in chancel, and entrance to roof loft, Llanbadarn Fawr church]]

Whenever it occurred, the long succession of monks and priests living a corporate (not necessarily [[Monasticism|monastic]]) life in the ''clas'', priory and finally college of priests was finally at an end, after many hundreds of years. However, as Chadwick has observed: &quot;clerics of Llanbadarn seem to have retained their vitality and intellectual activity down to the fifteenth century&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nora Kershaw Chadwick 1958 pp. 162-4&quot;/&gt; In 1508 a [[Canonical visitation|visitation]] of Vale Royal Abbey by the Abbot of [[Dore Abbey|Dore]] referred to the church and lordship of Llanbadarn Fawr,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;State of the monastery of Vale Royal (Cheshire) at the visitation by the Abbot of Dore ([[Herefordshire]]), 16 March 1508/9&quot; (National Archives, E 135/3/16). Dore was the mother house of Vale Royal. The term &quot;Lordship&quot; is probably to be taken to refer to the [[manor]] of Llanbadarn Fawr, later held by both the Pryses of Gogerddan and the Powells of Nanteos. By the early nineteenth century the name of the manor had been corrupted from Llanbadarn Fawr to Y Vaenor. There are other manors in the parish, including a small manor of Rhydonnen, and Crown manors such as Creuddyn; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, ''The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation'' (Longmans, London, 1810).&lt;/ref&gt; so the church remained important in the early sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The visitation recorded an annual income of Â£133 6 s 8 d; ''The Ledger Book of Vale Royal Abbey'' ed. John Brownbill (Manchester Record Society, Manchester, 1914), pp. 191â€“192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monuments in the chacel, and entrance to stair leading to the rood loft and the door leading to the vestries, Llanbadarn Fawr Church.jpg|thumb|Monuments in the chancel, and entrance to stair leading to the rood loft and the door leading to the vestries, Llanbadarn Fawr Church]]

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and the closure of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church rather than as a religious community. The church remained important in part because the [[parish]] was one of the largest in Wales (over 240 [[square mile]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-9832-church-of-st-padarn-llanbadarn-fawr#.VUjJ6flViko/ &quot;Church of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr&quot; in British Listed Buildings].&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did not recover the [[tithes]], nor the ownership of the lands that had once belonged to the church.&lt;ref&gt;W.B. Jones and E.A. Freeman, ''The history and antiquities of Saint David's'' (J.H. &amp; J. Parker, London, 1856), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Dissolution of the monasteries and the loss of church assets===

With [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]â€™s closure of the monasteries 1536â€“41, the advowson and tithes of Llanbadarn Fawr became the property of the lay owners. Under the later Stuarts the lordship of Llanbadarn had passed to the Earl of Danby,&lt;ref&gt;BM Harleian MS 1220 f. 121v; Frank Lewis, &quot;The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages&quot; (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15â€“40, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rectory to Sir Robert Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;BM Harleian MS 1220 f. 124v; Frank Lewis, &quot;The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages&quot; (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15â€“40, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1660 the tithes belonged to [[Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine|Roger Palmer]] (1634â€“1705), who became [[earl of Castlemaine]] by virtue (if that is the word) of his wife [[Barbara Villiers|Barbara (nÃ©e Villiers)]] being the mistress of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. Since Castlemaine did not acknowledge Barbaraâ€™s five children by Charles (and perhaps other lovers) the tithes of Llanbadarn passed to his nephew James. His daughter Catherine married Giles Chichester of Arlington Court, Devon. They were both Catholics, which forced them to pay heavy taxes.&lt;ref&gt;This section owes much to Gerald Morgan; Gerald Morgan, ''Ceredigion: A wealth of History'' (Gower, Llandysul, 2005). See Sir Alexander Bruce Palmer Chichester, Bart., ''History of the Family of Chichester from AD 1086 to 1870'' (printed for the author, J.C. Hotten, 1871).&lt;/ref&gt; Not all subsequent members of the Chichester family were absentees, however; [[Sir John Chichester, 1st Baronet, of Arlington Court]], was [[High Sheriff]] of Cardiganshire in 1831, when he was living in Llanbadarn Fawr. But the income was lost to the church.&lt;ref&gt;In the time of King [[James I of England|James I]], in &quot;Sir Richard Price, Knt. v.

On 21 June 1603 the manor of Llanbadarn was granted to Sir Thomas Jones and his sons Henry and Thomas. Afterwards it changed hands many times; Frank Lewis, &quot;The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages&quot; (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15â€“40, at p. 34; ''Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1603â€“1610'' (HMSO, London, 1857), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The tithes were not especially valuable; in the eighteenth century the vicarage was worth only Â£27 annually;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lewis, &quot;The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages&quot; (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15â€“40, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fourteenth century they were comparatively small compared with the income from the lands then owned by the church â€“ which passed with the manor or lordship,&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the indenture of 4 December 1635, which assigned the residue of a 99 year lease in the &quot;manor or lordship&quot;, late in tenure of Sir Thomas Jones, Sir Henry Jones and Thomas Jones, and &quot;late parcel of the monastery of Vale Royal&quot;, with reservation of all forests and royal mines, to Lewis Evans and David Evans; Francis Green (ed), ''Calendar of Deeds and Documents: vol 1 The Coleman Papers'' (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1921), D.D.110, p. 26.

Lewis, &quot;The manor of Llanbadarn Fawr&quot; (1964) 5(1) Ceredigion: the Journal of the Cardiganshire Antiquities Society 47â€“53.&lt;/ref&gt; on the Dissolution of the Monasteries, to the lay owners.&lt;ref&gt;In later years both the Pryses of Gogerddan and the Powells of Nanteos were lords of the manor. In 1657 Sir Richard Pryse leased out the manor; Francis Green (ed), ''Calendar of Deeds and Documents: vol 1 The Coleman Papers'' (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1921), D.D.117, pp. 28â€“9. The Pryses appear to have acquired an interest in the manor by 1640, as in that year Richard Pryse and Lewis Evans (the same to whom was assigned the manor in 1635), by deed poll, released the equity of redemption in a mortgage on the manor; ''Calendar of Deeds and Documents'', D.D.111, p. 26. By 1810 the manor belonged to the Duke of Leeds, and by 1895 the Powells of Nantoes; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, ''The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation'' (Longmans, London, 1810); ''Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire &amp; South Wales, 1895'' (1895). By the nineteenth century the lands of the manor were held by [[socage]]; Mrs Margaret Powell, the last of the Powells of Nanteos, who died in 1952, had continued to hold [[Court leet|courts leet]] at Nanteos until her death.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Llanbadarn tithes were not easy to collect: both the fishermen and the farmers of north Cardiganshire strongly resented the payments they had to make in goods, while the goods themselves (fish, corn, farm stock etc.) were not easy to collect and had to be sold for the money to pass to the Chichesters. It was easy for agents and collectors to line their own pockets, and to take advantage of the now-widowed Catherine by withholding their accounts. In 1727, she travelled to Cardiganshire by herself to claim her legal rights and stayed over winter. She then had to do so again in 1730: all her efforts were met with blank refusals and lies. During her long periods of forced residence she witnessed the beaching of ninety porpoises at Aberystwyth which were slaughtered by the local people. Her final journey to Wales in 1734 proved fatal, and she died in the county:&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Morgan, ''Ceredigion: A wealth of History'' (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 99..&lt;/ref&gt; a slate memorial to her is still to be seen above the vestry door in Llanbadarn church.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Katherine, widow of Giles Chichester&quot;; the tablet on the east wall of the chancel was erected 1739.

===Later life as a parish church===

Even after the Celtic ''clas'', the Norman priory and (possible) later college of priests had ceased to occupy the site, it remained an important educational and cultural centre.&lt;ref&gt;As Chadwick has observed: &quot;clerics of Llanbadarn seem to have retained their vitality and intellectual activity down to the fifteenth century&quot;; Nora Kershaw Chadwick, &quot;Intellectual life in West Wales in the Last Days of the Celtic Church&quot;, in Nora K. Chadwick, Kathleen Hughes, Christopher Brooke and Kenneth Jackson (eds), ''Studies in the Early British Church'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1958), pp. 162â€“4, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]], later [[Bishop]] of [[Bishop of Llandaff|Llandaff]] and of [[Bishop of St Asaph|St Asaph]], the first [[translator]] of the ''[[Bible]]'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in 1588,&lt;ref&gt;The Act for the Translating of the Bible and the Divine Service into the Welsh Tongue 1563  (5 Eliz. c. 28), ordered the translation of the ''Bible'' and the Book of Common Prayer into Welsh by 1567. The translation was done by Morgan while he was vicar of [[Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant]].&lt;/ref&gt; was [[vicar]]&lt;ref&gt;He may have been curate rather than vicar, although this is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt; of Llanbadarn Fawr 1572â€“1575.

The huge extent of the mediaeval parish of Llanbadarn made Sunday worship impossible for distant inhabitants, so early centres with a Christian identity like Llanychaearn and Llaneithr would act as [[chapels of ease]], and later churches whether built by Welsh princes (such as [[Llanfihangel-y-Creuddyn]]) or Norman lords (e.g. [[Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn]]) were also subordinate to Llanbadarn before developing as separate parishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Churches like Llanbadarn with a large hinterland of lesser churches are often known as ''mam-eglwysi'', mother churches. There were no parishes in Wales prior to the coming of the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;The eighth Archbishop of Canterbury [[Theodore of Tarsus]] (c. 602â€“690) applied the ecclesiastical term parish to the [[Anglo-Saxons#Culture|Anglo-Saxon township]] format where already in existence. Extended since the 973â€“975 reign of [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]] (c. 943â€“975) the process of parish organisation appears to have been completed in England during the fifty-year reign of [[Edward III]] (1312â€“1377), when it was also extended to those parts of Wales where it was not yet in operation. For general background see David Petts, ''The Early Medieval Church in Wales'' (Stroud, 2009), pp. 157â€“97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, because it was impossible for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts of the parish, the church eventually had many [[chapels of ease]], as the population of the parish grew. One example of the latter is All Saints Church, [[Llangorwen]],&lt;ref&gt;All Saints was built from local stone, probably quarried nearby. The church was designed by the important architect, [[Henry Jones Underwood]], and later had a tower and porch added to a design by [[William Butterfield]], the main architect of the [[Oxford Movement]]. It has colourful stained glass, a [[lectern]] believed to be carved from a single piece of [[walnut]] and a set of [[candelabra]] said to be presented by the [[Beatification|Blessed]] John Henry [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[John Henry Newman|Newman]], a leader of the [[Tractarian Movement]].&lt;/ref&gt; which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.

During this time the church at Llanbadarn Fawr gradually declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, and more and more chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated to such an extent that serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Lloyd 2006 p. 494-497&quot;&gt;Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, ''Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales'' (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 494-497.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Lloyd 2006 p. 494-497&quot;/&gt; The church was relatively plainly decorated â€“ see below â€“ and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.&lt;ref&gt;J.T. Evans, ''The Church Plate of Cardiganshire. With the Chantry Certificates Relating to the County of Cardigan By the Commissioners Of 2 Edward VI (1548); Extracts from the Returns of Church Goods in 6 &amp; 7 Edward VI (1552â€“1553); Notes on Registers, Bells Etc.'' (James J Alden, 1914), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The church today===

In 2014 the church underwent Â£100,000 worth of repairs, including the replacement of the obsolete heating system, and replastering and repainting of the internal stonework.&lt;ref&gt;PCC accounts 2014â€“2015, presented to Easter Vestry, 12 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parish was previously a single parish [[benefice]] (under a [[vicar]]), but from 2012 has been in the Benefice of Llanbadarn Fawr and Elerch and [[Penrhyncoch]] and [[Capel Bangor]],&lt;ref&gt;The formation of the Grouped Benefice was approved by a resolution of the Standing Committee of the Diocesan Conference at its meeting on 13 December 2012 and the Bishop's Decree was sealed by him on 20 December 2012. In practice it did not come into effect until the licensing of the new Priest in Charge, in May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[deanery]] of Llanbadarn Fawr, in the [[archdeaconry]] of Cardigan, of the [[Diocese of St David's]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stpadarns-llanbadarn.org.uk/ St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr, Aberystwyth.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The parish, most recently of a [[broad church|central church]] persuasion, and with a strong [[choral]] tradition, generally has separate Welsh and English language services. The Vicar (formally [[priest-in-charge]]) is currently the Reverend Andrew Loat, appointed in 2014, after an [[interregnum]] from 2008, following the retirement of the [[Reverend]] Timothy Morgan (2001â€“2008), the previous vicar. The [[Venerable]] Hywel Jones (vicar 1979â€“1992) had been cleric with [[pastoral care]] 2008â€“2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stpadarns-llanbadarn.org.uk/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church is now part of &quot;Peaceful Places&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peaceful-places.com/destination/llanbadarn-fawr.&lt;/ref&gt; a heritage tourism trail, which tells the stories of a collection of churches and chapels across North Ceredigion.

===Organ===

The church contains a two manual and pedal, 14-stop pipe organ dating from 1885 by [[Forster and Andrews]]. A specification can be found on the [[National Pipe Organ Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{National Pipe Organ Register|id=B00140|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

There are no traces of the fabric of the original ''clas'' church. Most buildings in the sixth century were of wood, [[wattle and daub]]. Even churches were wooden. Although the use of stone was not unknown elsewhere in Britain at this time, it was not used in Wales (it was rare anywhere in Britain until the eleventh century). Churches were also distinguished by their comparatively small size and simplicity. They tended to be under 40 feet long, with a single tall, aisleless nave, and with a small square chancel attached. They were often [[Oratory (worship)|oratories]], rather than full churches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Banister Fletcher]], ''A History of Architecture on the comparative method'' (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1931), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the early church settlement at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, it is unlikely that significant building work was done. The ''clas'' church would continue to reflect a strong [[Celts|Celtic]] form for many years. But even though St [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], failed to extend his authority to the Christians in [[Wales]] and [[Dumnonia]] at the beginning of the seventh century, the influence of the western church was to begin to be gradually felt. However, even then, the tendency in west Wales was to build larger and larger single cell churches, rather than adopt the newly fashionable [[basilica]]n design.&lt;ref&gt;This signifies a building that has similarities to the basilica structures of Ancient Rome, being of longitudinal rather than central plan, having a central nave with an aisle on either side separated by a [[colonnade]], and an [[apse]] at one end.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building at Llanbadarn Fawr was greatly injured by the Danes in 988, and again (by Gruffydd ab Llewelyn) in 1038.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Meeting at Gogerddan&quot; (1911) 1(1) Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 23â€“30, at p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of an earlier structure were alleged to be included in the present edifice,&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Picturesque Guide to Wales: North and South and Monmouth-shire'' (Adam and Charles Black, Edinburgh; Catherall and Pritchard, Chester, 1869), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; which is of early English style. This is, however, unlikely, as stone church construction in Wales has been conventionally dated to the twelfth century and later,&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard has argued for an upsurge of stone church construction in Wales in the ninth and tenth centuries, starting on prestigious sites, in response to ecclesiastical reorganization and extensive contact with the Anglo-Saxons; Aimee Pritchard, &quot;The Origins of Ecclesiastical Stone Architecture in Wales&quot;, in Nancy Edwards (ed), ''The Archaeology of Early Medieval Celtic Churches, Proceedings of a Conference on The Archaeology of the Early Medieval Celtic Churches, September 2004'' (Society for Medieval Archaeology Monograph/Maney Publishing, Leeds, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and the earlier buildings were probably wooden, although we know that a new tower and porch were built around 1115.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nora Kershaw Chadwick 1958 pp. 162-4&quot;/&gt; Much evidence which might have shown whether there was any fabric dating from before the thirteenth century reconstruction, and even as far back as late Celtic (or Romano-British) times, was lost with the extensive late-Victorian reconstruction, particularly of the nave, is hidden beneath the present church, or is in the churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Morgan, ''Ceredigion: A wealth of History'' (Gower, Llandysul, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The present structure has many traces of great antiquity, being large and built in the form of a cross, with a door of early [[Gothic architecture]]. The building was probably erected some time after the Norman Conquest, as the plain pointed arch prevails throughout; exactly when we cannot be sure, though possibly after 1246. The earliest visible stonework is thirteenth century, in the tower and the arches supporting it. The external appearance of the church is large and ancient, being erected of rubble stone, with [[ashlar]] [[quoins]] and windows. The severe appearance and thick walls of the nave suggest Norman architecture, however the presence of pointed lancet windows indicate that it is early Gothic, perhaps from early thirteenth century. Internally the church is in the form of an [[aisle]]less [[cruciform]]&lt;ref&gt;The only other cruciform church in Ceredigion was [[Strata Florida Abbey]]; Gerald Morgan, ''Ceredigion: A wealth of History'' (Gower, Llandysul, 2005), p. 78. Very little now survives of the abbey, except a section of wall and the west door; T. Jones Pierce, &quot;Strata Florida Abbey&quot; (1950) 1 Ceredigion 18â€“33; David M. Robinson and Colin Platt, ''Strata Florida Talley Abbey'' (Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments, Cardiff, rev. ed. 1998); D.H. Williams, &quot;The White Monks in Powys II: Strata Florida&quot; (1976) 11 Cistercian Studies 155â€“191.&lt;/ref&gt; [[church (building)|church]] with substantial [[transept]]s. It was rebuilt (or built afresh) in the thirteenth century after a fire, and the chancel extended in the fifteenth century, after which the structure was largely complete as it is seen today.&lt;ref&gt;Much of the following section relies on [http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-9832-church-of-st-padarn-llanbadarn-fawr#.VUjJ6flViko/ &quot;Church of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr&quot; in British Listed Buildings] and Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, ''Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales'' (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 494-497.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The exterior===

Externally, there are [[slate]] roofs and coped [[gable]]s with cross [[finials]]. The roofs have patterned bands of fishscale [[Whitland Abbey]] slates, except on the nave. There are large scale, plain [[buttress|unbuttressed]] walls without [[Batter (walls)|batter]] for the nave, a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a chancel with a nineteenth century addition of a north [[choir]] [[vestry]]; the dating of the priests' vestry, on the north side of the chancel, is less certain.&lt;ref&gt;When identifiable sacristies began to appear as identifiable spaces in parish churches by the later thirteenth century they were commonly small rectangular adjuncts on the north side of the chancel, which matches the vestry at St Padarn's; Warwick Rodwell, ''The Archaeology of Churches'' (Amberley, Stroud, 2013), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Externally, the nave downpipes on the south side are dated 1884.

The tower has numerous [[Putlog hole|put-log holes]], and is supported on four massive columns and surmounted by a nineteenth century low [[octagonal]] [[Broach spire|broached]] short slated recessed slated spire with fish-scale slates and [[Weather vane|weathercock]]. There are nineteenth century [[Louver|louvred]] paired cusped bell-lights and a [[corbel]]led [[Battlement|embattled]] [[parapet]]. The tower contains a fine peal of [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], with the oldest of the original set of six being cast in 1749 by [[Rudhall of Gloucester|Rudhall]] bell foundry.&lt;ref&gt;The Rudhall familyâ€™s bell foundry in Gloucester was established in the later 17th century by Abraham Rudhall. His first known bells were a ring of five supplied to St. Nicholasâ€™s church in Oddington in 1684 and one of them still remains in the churchâ€™s tower and is rung regularly; Mary Bliss, &quot;The Last Years of John Rudhall, Bellfounder of Gloucester, 1828â€“35&quot; (2003) 121 Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society 11â€“22, at 11. Bell founding has been a Gloucester industry for at least seven hundred years. The earliest reference is to a burgess called 'Hugh the Bellfounder' in about 1270. One of the leading foundries was run by the Gloucester family of Rudhall who, between 1684 and 1835 produced over 5000 bells in the city, which were dispatched all over the UK and abroad. The oldest peal of bells in the USA, at Christ Church Boston, was cast by Rudhall's of Gloucester in 1774. The oldest bell in St Padarn's was probably cast by Abel Abraham, grandson of the founder of the firm.&lt;/ref&gt; Two were added in 1886, when the bell chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the new millennium in 2000, when some of the others were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001. The tower presents one of the more noticeable views in Aberystwyth. It also contains a south side clock dated 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Lloyd 2006 p. 494-497&quot;/&gt;

The church is some 163 feet long.

===The chancel===

The interior consists of chancel, nave, transepts and south porch, and is formed of rough materials, now largely plastered and [[whitewash]]ed.

The large chancel was restored around 1475, primarily it would appear by extending it and adding new red sandstone [[Perpendicular]] segmental-pointed side windows, one three-light and one single-light to the south and one three-light to the north â€“ all now with nineteenth century tracery and stained glass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Lloyd 2006 p. 494-497&quot;/&gt; The window is Gothic equilateral.

[[File:South transept, east side, showing join to crossing and chancel, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|South transept, east side, showing join to crossing and chancel]]

An inscription in the left side window [[jamb]] of the east window in the south wall of the chancel may be a contemporary memorial to William Stratford;&lt;ref&gt;The jam-stones, four-centred heads and cills are believed to be original, with the mullions and heads of the lights being renewed in 1882â€“84; W. Gwyn Thomas, &quot;The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church&quot; (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127â€“129, at 129.&lt;/ref&gt; it is the word &quot;Stratford&quot;, with a coat of arms with a [[rebus]] of the letter &quot;W&quot; and an abbot's [[crozier]] set behind the &quot;W&quot;, with two four-leaved flowers either side.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Hemp in (1931) 86(2) Archeaologia Cambrensis 403â€“404.&lt;/ref&gt; Below this window, now partly obscured by a [[credence table]], is a mediaeval [[piscina]]. Another inscription, possibly late fifteenth century, is in the right window jamb of the easternmost north wall window. This is to Thomas ap Dafydd, [[proctor]],&lt;ref&gt;Proctors practised in the civil law-dominated admiralty and ecclesiastical courts, the equivalent of attorneys elsewhere. Like the attorneys, they were ''domini litis'' rather than merely spokesmen (hence personally involved in the outcome of a case in which they were involved); ''Obicini v Bligh'' (1832) 8 Bing 335, 352 per Tindal, CJ. They were ultimately housed in [[Doctors' Commons]]. Prior to 1570, when membership of Doctorsâ€™ Commons was made compulsory for advocates, some proctors had been members; Sir John Baker, &quot;The English Legal Profession 1450â€“1550&quot; in Wilfred Prest (ed), ''Lawyers in Early Modern Europe and America'' (Croom Helm, London, 1981), p. 24. They had much greater public exposure than advocates, and spent more time in court. Some proctors were bachelors, but some were non-graduates; Brian Levach, &quot;The English Civilians, 1500â€“1750&quot; in Wilfred Prest (ed), ''Lawyers in Early Modern Europe and America'' (Croom Helm, London, 1981), p. 110. The period of articles required was seven years; Harry Kirk, ''Portrait of a Profession. A History of the Solicitorâ€™s Profession, 1100 to the Present Day'' (Oyez Publishing, London, 1976), p. 20. They were members of the [[Court of Arches]], but, unlike the advocates, did not enjoy exclusive audience in the [[Court of Chivalry]], where [[Attorney at law|attorneys]] and [[solicitor]]s could also practise; See, for example, ''Hungerford v Broad'' (1639) Acta Cu Mil (5), 151â€“2; ''Somerset v Good'' (1637) Cur Mil I, 232. Proctors were admitted by patent of a bishop, to practice in the [[consistory court]] of the diocese. Proctors gradually died out as a separate order after 1857 (they were never very numerous, there being some ten in practise in the Court of Arches, another eight in York, and smaller numbers at other consistory courts; Harry Kirk, ''Portrait of a Profession. A History of the Solicitorâ€™s Profession, 1100 to the Present Day'' (Oyez Publishing, London, 1976), p. 20), as there was insufficient work for separate professions, as in that year the [[Court of Probate Act 1857|Court of Probate Act]] took away the proctors' monopoly of [[probate]] work (s 42), and gave them the right to be admitted as solicitors (s 43). In 1873 all solicitors, attorneys and proctors became solicitors of the [[Courts of England and Wales#Senior Courts of England and Wales|supreme court]]. It is quite probable that Thomas ap Dafydd was a proctor in the St David's diocese [[consistory court]], which met in St Peter's Church, [[Carmarthen]]; see N. Page, &quot;Excavations in St Peterâ€™s Church, Carmarthen, 2000&quot; (2001) 41 Archaeology in Wales 51â€“61.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Angharad.&lt;ref&gt;For the fifteenth century chancel generally, see W. Gwyn Thomas, &quot;The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church&quot; (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127â€“129.&lt;/ref&gt; The great five-light east window is also of red stone,&lt;ref&gt;If Triassic, this red sandstone may well be of Cheshire origins; W. Gwyn Thomas, &quot;The Chancel of Llanbadarn Fawr Church&quot; (1978) 127 Archaeologia Cambrensis 127â€“129, at 129.&lt;/ref&gt; with nineteenth century late Gothic style tracery.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-9832-church-of-st-padarn-llanbadarn-fawr#.VUjJ6flViko/ &quot;Church of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr&quot; in British Listed Buildings] and Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, ''Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales'' (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 494-497.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an ornate semi-circular wooden ceiling with smaller panels along the ridge, moulded ribs and carved bosses, and [[Brattishing|brattished]] [[cornice]] each side above a row of little [[fan vault|fan-vaults]] separating seven half-round panels with shield-bearing [[angels]]. The ceiling is finely finished with [[Boss (architecture)|bosses]] at the intersection of the moulded principals and [[purlins]]. It was inserted in 1882â€“84.&lt;ref name=&quot;W.

The truss had slots for the panels of a boarded ceiling (a wagon roof).&lt;ref name=&quot;W. Gwyn Thomas 1978&quot;/&gt;

The entrance to the chancel from the crossing has a red [[marble]] step, with [[mosaic]], and [[Mintons|Minton]] [[Encaustic tile|encaustic]] tile panels of a three-branch lamp, then another marble step and black marble main chancel flooring in small paving slabs. In the sanctuary there are a further three marble steps, with paving of pink marble with black in square or zigzag patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Priest's vestry, angle of wall to chancel, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|Priestsâ€™ vestry, angle of wall adjoining to chancel]]

There are three small square-panelled doors to the north wall of the chancel. One is at the base of the former rood loft stair, and this may be followed up a mural staircase built into the thickness of the wall, to a second door, which is high on the wall to the left. This would have been the entrance to the rood loft itself. The two doors are of slightly different style; the lower door has a triangular form not seen elsewhere in the church, suggesting early Tudor work. The upper door, which would originally have led to a loft, is a four-centred arch, possibly late Gothic, probably late fifteenth to early sixteenth century. The two could be contemporaneous with the work in the rest of the chancel. 
 
The third door is a vestry door further right, leading to the small gabled north priests' vestry. It is of uncertain age and could be of nineteenth century origin. It now includes a modern brick chimney stack.&lt;ref&gt;In the later middle ages and particularly in the eighteenth century fireplaces began to invade sacristies; Warwick Rodwell, ''The Archaeology of Churches'' (Amberley, Stroud, 2013), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;). The priests' vestry in turn leads to the later nineteenth century choir [[sacristy]] or vestry. This is a slight lean-to structure, with timber glazing to the roof in two levels, and is built, none too elegantly, between the east end of the north transept and the original priests' vestry.

Opposite the internal doors, in the south wall, there is a plain pointed priest's door with cut stone [[voussoir]]s, by [[John Pollard Seddon|Seddon]], with wrought iron hinges.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Priest's door, St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr, Ceredigion.jpg|thumb|Priestsâ€™ door in chancel, south side]]

The 1880s Seddon high [[altar]] has a fine [[reredos]] across the east wall in red [[sandstone]] and white marble. There is red stone outer wall-panelling in squares of rose and vine, in a moulded frame. A white marble shelf or [[Retable]] on brackets over pink marble framing is behind the altar, with outer panels of white marble with a cross on vine background. The frame is stepped over the main reredos. Five white marble inner panels are separated by short half-octagonal red stone columns. There are [[Alpha and Omega]] symbols&lt;ref&gt;Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and a title of Christ or of God in the Book of Revelation.&lt;/ref&gt; at each end and three long panels, two of vine and a centre passion flower. Above these latter three are three white marble lettered panels, two with &quot;Laus Deo&quot; (&quot;Praise be to God&quot;), and the centre with &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot; (&quot;Glory to God in the highest&quot;), also red stone framed.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Timber altar rails by Seddon, in open grid within panels, the top openings cusped, protect the sanctuary. The timber altar is also by Seddon, with three panels each of four [[quatrefoils]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Following a common practice in convents and collegiate churches it is believed that there were usually choir stalls in the west end of the chancel (often called the choir or quire). Several Seddon pews remain here,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Lloyd 2006 p. 494-497&quot;/&gt; although the choir today occupies the crossing.

===The crossing===

There is a red marble step to the chancel end of the crossing. The crossing has a [[chamfered]] north east angle for a tower stair, with a door at the foot. Two small windows light the staircase to the ringing chamber. There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view the crossing.&lt;ref&gt;This is known as a Holy Ghost hole, which could serve the purpose of allowing the image of a dove to be lowered for [[Pentecost]].&lt;/ref&gt; The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The stalls and pews in the crossing, by Seddon, are similar to the pews in the nave (being of pitch pine with pegged [[Mortise and tenon|tenon]] joints) but are more ornate, with open-arcaded front kneelers and two reading desks with triple pointed arches to the fronts and scrolled tops to the uprights.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

At the entrance to the south transept is the organ. This is by [[Forster and Andrews]], of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. This organ building company was formed by James Alderson Forster (1818â€“1886) and Joseph King Andrews (1820â€“1896). The business developed and became one of the most successful of the North of England organ builder. The business was taken over by John Christie in 1924 and finally wound up in 1956. As well as their Hull headquarters, the company had branches in London and York.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=British Institute of Organ Studies|title=The National Pipe Organ Register|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/ESearch.cgi?Fn=Esearch&amp;firm=800|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[organ (music)|organ]] dates from 1885. It was a gift from Sir Pryse Pryse, [[Baronet|Bt]] [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] [[Justice of the Peace|JP]], of Gogerddan.&lt;ref&gt;Born 1838 and died 1906, he was created a baronet, the second creation of Pryse of Gogerddan, in 1866. He was the heir of Margaret (Pryse) and Edward Loveden Loveden, being her great grandson. The title became extinct on the death of the fifth baronet, in 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The organ has a pine case, and painted pipes.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

===The south transept (the chapel of St Padarn and exhibition)===

The transepts have boarded ceilings with heavier ribs, and three by six panels, each panel subdivided in four, with brattishing and a band of quatrefoils to the wall-plate. Each transept has pointed tomb recesses in the end wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:South transept, east wall, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|South transept, east wall]]

[[File:South transept west wall, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|South transept west wall]]

The south transept (popularly known as Capel y Dre [the Chapel of the Town] or Capel Aberystwyth) is now a museum and [[chapel]] of St Padarn. This was built 1985â€“1988, in the space of the old transept, to designs by [[Peter Lord (art historian)|Peter Lord]], with work by a number of notable craftspeople. It was an initiative of the town rather than of the church. The exhibition depicts the rich history of the area, with displays on St Padarn, and local people like [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]]. A facsimile copy of Morgan's ''Bible'' is displayed there. Another display tells the life story of Sulien. There are three niches or recesses, which may once have held the monumental [[effigy|effigies]] of some of its priests, but no effigies remain. The two larger niches are in the central chapel; a smaller niche houses the altar stone in the chapel of St Padarn, to the left.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Coat of arms on south transept screen, St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms on south transept screen, St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr]]

A [[Pinus rigida|pitch pine]] screen with etched glass panels of winter and spring leads to the new rooms in the transept. The screen contains lines from the poetry of [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]], who is regarded as one of the leading Welsh poets and amongst the great poets of Europe in the Middle Ages. Dafydd ap Gwilym wrote his famous poem &quot;[[The Girls of Llanbadarn]]&quot; (&quot;Merched Llanbadarn&quot;) about the church in the mid-fourteenth century. There is a ceramic [[coat of arms]] set into the screen on the right-hand side, with the motto &quot;Gorau Gorchwyl Gwarchod&quot; (&quot;Best reference for protection&quot;).

[[File:Drawings of the pre-Christian standing stones at St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|Nineteenth century drawings of the pre-Christian Celtic standing stones at St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr]]

The church contains two ancient carved stone crosses, since 1987 in the south transept. They were formally (before 1916) on display opposite the entrance to the south porch. Earlier still, before 1830, they had been situated in the angle between the south transept and the nave.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Miscellanea: Moved stones&quot; (1917) 17 Archaeologia Cambrensis 163-6, at pp. 165â€“6.&lt;/ref&gt; One in particular shows strong [[Ireland|Irish]] and Viking influence. The first of the crosses is short and squat, with clear arms to each side, in a style reminiscent of [[pagan]] &quot;[[Earth Mother]]&quot; figurines. It has a crude roll-mould border to a roughly hewn cross. It is much eroded but has one crude human figure with spiral across the body; it may be late tenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Central room, showing position of standing crosses, and entrance to Sulien Room, Llanbadarn Fawr church.jpg|thumb|South transept central room, showing position of standing crosses, and entrance to Sulien Room, Llanbadarn Fawr church]]

The second cross is tall and slender, a free standing monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like the figure of a saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is [[granophyre]] and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;For the crosses generally see Nancy Edwards, ''A Corpus of Early Medieval Inscribed Stones and Stone Sculpture in Wales: Volume II: South-West Wales'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2007), pp. 135â€“41 and V.E. Nash-Williams, ''The Early Christian Monuments of Wales'' (University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1950), no. 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the [[Afon Mawddach|Mawdddach estuary]], [[Gwynedd]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Morgan identifies this as a likely point of origin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centre room of the transept there is a low slate slab altar stone, with an etched red [[Chi-Ro]] emblem, with Alpha and Omega incised. A Chi-ro is an early form of [[Christogram]], and is formed by the super imposition of the first two letters of the Greek alphabet onto a circle. There is a rough [[Cornwall|Cornish]] [[granite]] monolith seat and [[prie-dieu]], which with the altar stone are inset with gold-enamelled small tiles by Andrew Rowe. The wall plaster has an incised red line. There is a white glazed tiled floor with red tile border around the two early Celtic crosses. In the south wall above the stone crosses are 1920s/1930s windows representing Saints Padarn, [[Saint David|Dewi]] and (in the centre and above) [[Saint Teilo|Teilo]]. The Padarn window is a single-light window with a standing figure of St Padarn holding a [[crosier|staff]] and [[chalice]], with a valley and hills behind him. It was given in memory of members of the Bonsall family, and was made by the Heaton, Butler &amp; Bayne, London, around 1930,&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt; thus preceding Peter Lord's work on the transept.

The staff borne by St Padarn in the window is probably intended to represent Curwen, which was revered at [[Llangorwen]]. It was given to him by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, along with a cloak or tunic, or so the ''Life of Padarn'' (''Vita Sancti Paternus'') tells us.&lt;ref&gt;The most complete copy of the ''Life'' is the Cotton Vespasian Axiv, written c.1200 at Brecon or Monmouth; E.G. Bowen, ''A History of Llanbadarn Fawr'' (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Padarnâ€™s crozier (whatever its true origin) became Llanbadarnâ€™s most important relic, still apparently extant in the twelfth century when Ieuan ap Sulien (d.1137), in a poem written on the life of his father Sulien, writes &quot;no other relic can be compared with Cyrwen. A wonderful gift â€“ Padarn's staff&quot;. (Cyrwen means &quot;white staff&quot;). It was no doubt this same crozier â€“ assuming that the relic was genuine â€“ that Bishop Sulien brought with him to the meeting of [[William the Conqueror]] with the two Welsh princes, [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]] and [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]] at St. Davidâ€™s in 1081, when the English king recognised [[Rhys ap Tewdwr|Lord Rhys]] as the legitimate ruler of [[Deheubarth]];&lt;ref&gt;Thanks to Gerald Morgan for additional information; See also Neil Evans, &quot;The Golden Age of the Welsh Saints: St Padarn&quot; (http://www.parishofaberystwyth.org.uk/history.html).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are small enclosed chambers to either side of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript ''Life of Padarn''. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by [[Samson of Dol|St Samson]], [[Maelgwn Gwynedd|Maelgwn]], [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and [[Caradoc|Caradog]], two [[Monarchy of Ireland|kings of Ireland]] on horseback and a figure with the [[Madonna (art)|Virgin and Child]]. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the [[Lichfield Gospels|''Book of St Chad'']]. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a [[porcelain]] [[relief]] sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the ''Life'', the [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]] by boiling water.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been [[consecration|consecrated]] so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a [[Eucharistic]] service.

[[File:The central room of the museum in the south transept, showing the altar stone, kneeling desk, and niches in the south wall, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|The central room of the museum in the south transept, showing the altar stone, kneeling desk, and niches in the south wall, Llanbadarn Fawr]]

To the right of the centre room are two small exhibition rooms entered through a screen with two further etched glass windows by Lord, of summer and spring. The first chamber, to the left and the smallest (the counterpart of the chapel of St Padarn), is Sulienâ€™s room, which has an incised slate floor slab and lettered text around wall from the ''Elegy'' of Rhygyfarch, both by Ieuan Rees.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Chapel of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr Church.jpg|thumb|chapel of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr Church]]

The larger room is entered from an outer chamber. In the outer chamber is located the [[Burma Campaign|Burma Star]] window (1985) with the [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima Epitaph]]. The Kohima Epitaph is carved into the 2nd British Division memorial and remembers those who fought in the Battle of Kohima in north east [[India]] in the spring of 1944 between the British and [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. It also constitutes a memorial to [[Major-General]] Lewis Pugh, of Cwmerau, [[Glandyfi]], who fought in the [[World War II|Second World War]] in the [[Far East]], and who is a kinsman of Brigadier-General Lewis Pugh Evans, VC, who is buried in the churchyard.

The other room, to the right has historical exhibits in display cases by Paul Roberts, and information panels lettered by Mihangel Morgan.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

===The transepts â€“ the north (the Lady Chapel)===

The north transept (formerly known as Capel Clarach&lt;ref&gt;Named after the township of Clarach, north of [[Aberystwyth]]. All Saints Church, [[Llangorwen]], which as mentioned above was a chapel of ease built in the 1840s, is in Clarach, which later became a separate parish.&lt;/ref&gt;) is now the [[Lady Chapel]]. In it are two recesses or niches, similar to those in the south transept. The larger niche, on the right, now houses a picture of St Padarn, dedicated in 2015. There is a small niche to the right, which is now used to store a service book and altar book stand when these are not in use on the altar. The stand is marked &quot;In memoriam 3rd Officer Kathleen Miller, WRNS. Lost at sea on active service, August 19th 1941&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Third Officer (Royal Navy equivalent [[Sub-Lieutenant]]) Miller (born 1907) was the daughter of Henry and Jane Anne Miller, of [[Englefield Green]], [[Surrey]], and was a native of Llanbadarn. She was lost on passage aboard the steam passenger ship ''Aguila'' from Liverpool to HMS Cormorant II, the [[Fleet Air Arm|Royal Naval Air Station]] at [[Gibraltar]]; http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/crews/person/32662.html; http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2657334/; The ''Aguila'' was a 3,255 ton vessel, built 1917, owned by the Yeoward Line, Liverpool, and was sailing as part of [[convoy]] OG-71; http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1063.html. She was sunk by the German submarine U-201, under Oberleutnant zur See (Royal Navy equivalent Sub-Lieutenant) Adalbert Schnee; http://uboat.net/boats/u201.htm. The ''Aguila'' (Master Arthur Firth) was the ship of the [[convoy commodore]] (Vice-Admiral [Commodore 2nd class] Patrick Edward Parker, [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[RNR]] (New Zealand) [[Aide de Camp|ADC]]) and sank within 90 seconds after being hit by two torpedoes. The commodore, five naval staff members, five gunners, 54 crew members and 88 passengers were lost. Among the passengers on board the ''Aguila'' were 21 women from the WRNS ([[Women's Royal Naval Service]]) who had volunteered for cypher and wireless duties in Gibraltar. None of the Wrens survived the sinking. As a tribute to their memory, a lifeboat named ''Aguila Wren'' was built and launched on 28 June 1952 for the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]]; http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/1063.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Virgin and Child]], to the left of the altar, was given by [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Geraint Vaughan-Jones in memory of his parents. He was one of the leading members of the group of twentieth century clergy who was able to reinvigorate the tradition of plygain singing (an abbreviated form of [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|morning service]] interspersed with and followed by [[carols]] sung by soloists and groups) within the Welsh church. Canon Vaughan-Jones (1929â€“2002) has a memorial in the [[churchyard]] in the angle of the south transept and the nave.

The north transept fittings are from 1936 and are by Caroe &amp; Passmore. They include a finely carved reredos with panelling each side, the altar, rails (in the form of a long kneeler), a lectern, pews and kneelers, all in pale oak. The reredos has a carved [[Crucifix]]ion, with [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St Mary]] and [[John the Apostle|St John]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt; There is a small [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[icon]], a [[Theotokos]], or [[Madonna (art)|Virgin and Child]], to the right of the reredos. It is a reproduction of an early icon, printed on paper mounted on wood, from Stylite Icons, [[Welshpool]], and probably dates from the 1980s.

[[File:Lady Chapel chapel, showing reredos, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|Lady Chapel, showing reredos]]

The floor of the Lady Chapel is of quarry tiles, with encaustic tiles at the entrance from the crossing. The only monument that survives in the floor is a brass plaque in memory of &quot;J J&quot; with the date 1822, superimposed over a cross patonce.

[[File:The Lady Chapel from the crossing, Llanbadarn Fawr.jpg|thumb|The Lady Chapel from the crossing, Llanbadarn Fawr]]

===The nave===

The [[nave]], which is aisleless, was formerly known as the Capel Hir (Long Chapel). The pews in the nave are by Seddon and are of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints. The stonework is almost all nineteenth century to the nave south wall, less so elsewhere.

[[File:Nave, south wall, Llanbadarn Fawr Church.jpg|thumb|Nave, south wall]]

The nave roof becomes increasingly elaborate towards the chancel. The nave roof is of eight by twelve panels, boarded with bosses and brattished wall plates.

The ancient [[Baptismal font|font]] by the west door dates from the twelfth century,&lt;ref&gt;Though it had previously been thought to be mid-thirteenth century; Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, ''Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion'' Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 495; Tyrrell Green, &quot;Cardiganshire fonts&quot; (1914) 1(4) Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 9â€“26, at pp. 24â€“5.&lt;/ref&gt; and has an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcaded]] basin. The plain pointed arch forms the only ornament on the font, which has an octagonal [[ashlar]] shaft now mounted on a platform, and supporting the octagonal basin. Unfortunately the font has been subject to extensive and clumsy repair. Unusually, it is made of [[Purbeck Marble|Purbeck marble]],&lt;ref&gt;Purbeck Marble is not, strictly speaking, a marble, as it is not a [[metamorphic rock]], like a true [[marble]], but is so-called because it can take a fine polish. See http://www.stone.uk.com/history/.&lt;/ref&gt; which is normally found in churches in south and eastern England; the only other example in Wales is in [[St David's Cathedral]]. Documentary evidence suggests that the massive stem dates from at least the nineteenth century, and stylistic evidence suggests that it is probably a lot earlier; the font basin itself is undoubtedly ancient. Seddon's restoration work in the church commenced in 1869, and included dismantling the font. He carefully cleaned and stored the stonework, and re-erected it on new platform of [[Radyr#Geological structure|Radyr]] [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] stone. Radyr Stone is a [[Triassic]] [[breccia]] used widely for decorative work in the [[Cardiff]] area, including [[Llandaff Cathedral]], [[Bute Docks|Cardiff Docks]] and in the bridges of the [[Taff Vale Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.englishstone.org.uk/documents/dimension%20stone%208.html |title=Triassic building sandstone resources |accessdate=7 July 2008}}; Timothy Palmer, &quot;The Purbeck Marble Font in St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr&quot; (2014) 18(2) Ceredigion 29â€“40.&lt;/ref&gt; The font previously stood on a three step platform, in the same position as it now stands. The font cover is nineteenth century, in oak and [[wrought iron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Font, Llanbadan Fawr.jpg|thumb|Twelfth century Purbeck marble font]]

In contrast to the antiquity of the font â€“ probably the oldest piece visible in the church, aside from the Celtic crosses â€“ the [[pulpit]] dates from 1879. It was presented by the Bishop of St Davidâ€™s (the scholarly [[Basil Jones]], bishop 1874â€“1897), in memory of his mother. It is in [[Beer Quarry Caves|Beer stone]] ashlar Gothic, formed of a drum with two cusped panels with carved stone reliefs of Saints [[John the Evangelist|John]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] by Hugh Stannus, with square rosettes and leaf-carving in [[spandrel]]s flanking, and a Gothic column with a large [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] for a book rest.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Opposite this is the usual brass eagle [[lectern]]. Both pulpit and lectern are placed in the archway between crossing and nave.

The nave and transept light fittings are by [[George Pace]] and date from the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

===The porch and arch===

The nave inner porch in oak with long narrow leaded lights was made by George Pace in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:The porch and entrance to Llanbadarn Fawr church. Through doorway it shows priest adminstrating holy baptism at the font 1860.jpg|thumb|The porch and entrance c.1860. Through doorway it shows the priest administrating holy baptism at the font. Printed by Day &amp; Haghan, lithographers to the Queen.]]

The west door, actually in the south side of the church, is an elegant ornamented [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]] pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;According to Meyrick the style is similar to one which was in vogue in the beginning of the twelfth century, and an example may be seen in [[Llandaff Cathedral]], erected by Bishop [[Urban (bishop of Llandaff)|Urban]] in 1120. A similar piece was found in Abbey Cwmhir; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, ''History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation (Longmans, London, 1810).&lt;/ref&gt; A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Lloyd 2006 p. 496&quot;/&gt; Strata Florida Abbey was originally founded in 1164 and was [[consecrated]] in 1201.&lt;ref&gt;The name Strata Florida is a corruption of the Welsh ''Ystrad Fflur'', and has a double meaning; &quot;Valley of (the river of) Flowers&quot;. ''Ystrad'' corrupts into &quot;Strata&quot;, while ''Fflur'' (&quot;Flowers&quot;) is also the name of the nearby river.&lt;/ref&gt; The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Egwys Llanbadarn Fawr, Abersytwyth 4.JPG|thumb|The porch, showing the outer nineteenth century arch and the inner ancient arch]]

The nineteenth century porch has a big ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded segmental pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three steps up to the fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and cambered [[lintel]] under an oak [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] with roundel pierced with three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

===The monuments===

A large range of seventeenth and eighteenth century monuments survive, mainly in the chancel. They include some for members of the major landowning families in the (original) parish, including the Powells of Nanteos&lt;ref&gt;This family claims descent from Edwin ap Gronow Prince of Tegeingl (d. 1073). Dafydd ap Philip ap Hywel is said to have been the first â€˜ap Hywel (whence Powell) connected with Llechwedd-dyrus, the first seat of the family. Though like the Pryses of Gogerddan the Powells were an ancient family, they were not quite so long at Nanteos as the Pryses had been at Gogerddan. The earliest recorded occupier of the estate was Colonel John Jones, who raised a [[regiment]] of foot at Nanteos, in defence of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] during the Civil War and was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire for 1665. He had no sons and so the estate was inherited in 1666 by his daughter Anne, who had married a Dutch mining engineer, Cornelius Le Brun, who in turn became High Sheriff in 1676. Their only daughter Averina duly inherited, having married William Powell (1658â€“1738) of Llechwedd Dyrus, and passed it on in 1738 to their eldest son, Thomas. The last of the Powells, Margaret Powell, who died in 1951, was the widow of Edward Athelstan Lewis Powell, who had died in 1930. Their only son was killed in the First World War; his monument is in the chancel: &quot;In ever loving and honoured memory of William Edward George Pryse Wynne Powell, Lieut Welsh Guards, only child of Capt. and Mrs E.A.L. Powell of Nanteos, and grandson of William Beauclerk Powell of Nanteos and Sir Pryse Pryse Bart. of Gogerddan. Born March 8th 1899 and killed near Buvianies in France Nov 6th 1918, while gallantly leading his men in action. Brave, kind, and true, he endeared himself to all during his short life, and died as he had lived, a true and very gallant Welsh gentleman. 'mil gwell yw marw'n fachgen dewr. Nia byw yn fachgen llwfr!'&quot;. Edward Athelstan Lewis Powell had himself died &quot;from the effects of an illness contracted while serving in Mesopotamia in the Great War&quot;. Mrs Powell bequeathed the property in 1951 to Mrs Elizabeth Mirylees, a distant relative of her husband, who moved in 1956. She sold it in 1967 to Geoff and Rose Bliss, who lived there until 1983, opening the building to the public. Since then there have been several owners but the mansion now operates as a hotel. In 2004 it was purchased by the [[Saxoncourt]] Group, and has been extensively restored; Gerald Morgan (ed), ''Nanteos: A Welsh House and its family'' (Gomer, Llandysul, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; (who were long-time [[Lords of the Manor]] of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan.&lt;ref&gt;The Pryses of Gogerddan traced their lineage back to Gwaethfod, Lord of Ceredigion (c. 1057). They settled at Gogerddan in the first half of the fourteenth century, the first member of the family to live there probably being Rhys ap Dafydd Llwyd. Plas Gogerddan was originally built in the latter half of the fifteenth century. Sion Prys (John Pryse) became the first to use the surname Pryse and was the first member of the Gogerddan family to become an M.P. (1553â€“1555). The estate was broken up in the first half of the twentieth century, and much of the remaining lands and Plas Gogerddan were acquired by [[Aberystwyth University]] in 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; A white marble [[Commemorative plaque|tablet]] was erected in 1666 to [[Colonel]] John Jones, of Nanteos.&lt;ref&gt;The inscription to this monument states: &quot;Here lie the earthly remains of John Jones of Nant EÃ²s in the County of Cardigan, Esq. Lieutent Coll. Of a Foot Regimt raised there for the service of Kg Charles ye 1 st of bld Memory who by the Grace of God was true to the Church in time of persecution to the King in time of Rebellion when for doing good, he suffered much evil and after when it lay in his power he required none. Who in the midst of much business and tedious Trouble was a great example of Learning Himself, and a Furtherer of it to others. A Loving Husband, A tender Father, And a faithful Friend, Who lived to see this Kingdom restor'd, but was called to receive his reward in a better, In the year of our Lord 1666, of his own Age 32. To the pious and well deserved Remembrance of whom, This Memorial was set up in the year 1708 by his Daughter Anne The disconsolate relict of the above Inscrib'd Cornelius Le Brun Esq. With whom and her Father she hopes in God's good time to rest here In peace, and at the last Day with them to partake of A Happy Resurrection.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, to the left of the north wall window. To the left of the great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To the right side of the altar â€“ the epistle side of the chancel â€“ is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

There is a very fine mosaic floor to the centre aisle and cross aisles by Seddon with inset lozenge panels of [[Mintons|Minton]] [[Encaustic tile|encaustic]] tiles of kneeling priests.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

===The windows===

Every window in the church contains coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single [[lancet window|lancets]], and at the ends of the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving arch of an older window well above.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The east window is a [[memorial]] to Mrs Rosa Edwyna Powell (died 1860), of [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]], and her daughter Harriet Edwyna (died 1857), and was inserted by direction of the Will of her son George (died 1882). It depicts the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was designed by Seddon and installed in 1884. There are other [[stained glass]] windows, including the three western lancets, filled with stained glass by the parishioners in 1894, in memory of the [[Reverend]] John Pugh, [[curate]] 1856â€“1861 and vicar 1861â€“1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The last window that had contained plain glass was given stained glass in the late twentieth century. For many years well-known local musician Professor [[Ian Parrott]] regularly sat beneath this window during services. Before he died, at the age of 96, he commissioned a stained glass window â€“ as he said, he would like to be able to enjoy it before he died.&lt;ref&gt;Parrott was a prolific Anglo-Welsh composer and writer on music. His distinctions included the first prize of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] for his [[symphonic poem]] &quot;Luxor&quot;, and commissions by the [[BBC]] and [[Yale University]], and for many leading British musicians. In 1958 his &quot;cor anglais&quot; [[concerto]] was first performed at the [[Cheltenham Festival]], and in 1963 his [[cello concerto]] was given by [[William Pleeth]] and the [[HallÃ© Orchestra]] â€“ both concertos were conducted by Sir [[John Barbirolli]]. From 1951 to 1983 he was Gregynog Professor of Music at [[Aberystwyth University]].&lt;/ref&gt; The window, which was designed by [[John Petts (artist)|John Petts]], is on the theme of &quot;Music in Praise of the Lord&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

===The nineteenth century restoration work===

There were still fine mediaeval screens in the church in 1810, possibly lost when repairs were done in 1813â€“16; they were gone by 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas Lloyd 2006 p. 496&quot;&gt;Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, ''Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion'' Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan'' (1810) by Sir [[Samuel Rush Meyrick]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The chancel and north transept are separated from the rest of the church by light and elegant carved screens, which, from the elaborate workmanship they display, were probably erected about the time of Henry the Seventh. They are coloured red, green and yellow, and though once very brilliant, are now so covered with dirt as to be scarce perceptible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nothing now survives of these carved screens, which were made of oak.

[[File:St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr, etchings of now lost interior woodwork.jpg|thumb|Nineteenth century etchings of the now lost interior woodwork, St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr]]

In poor condition in the mid-nineteenth century, the nave walls were leaning outward and the roofs decayed, so restoration was proposed in 1848 under R.K. Penson, but not actively pursued until the Reverend John Pugh became vicar in 1861, when new plans were made by [[William Butterfield]]. Butterfield however resigned in 1867 and the restoration was finally carried out 1867â€“84 by [[John Pollard Seddon]]. The church was substantially restored in stages at a cost of Â£8,500, and the roof was renewed, apart from the wagon roof over the chancel, which survives above Seddon's roof.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The restoration work in general consisted of the reconstruction of the nave, the lifting and paving of the chancel, the construction of a new altar and the reconstruction of the north and south transepts. The nave was opened in 1869 and the tower and south transepts were opened in 1880.

Seddon thought that the church had once been much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and proposed inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones,&lt;ref&gt;Though the restoration of the church 1867â€“84 was severe, it must be noted that the bishop, who took an active role, was not without some claim to architectural and historical expertise. While at Oxford (which he left in 1865, at the age of 43, having been a [[lecturer]] in modern history and the classics, to be vicar of [[Bishopsthorpe]]), he showed himself to have a keen interest in archaeological and architectural affairs. He is credited with the design of his parish church at [[Llangynfelyn]]. From 1848 through to 1851 he was one of the general secretaries of the [[Cambrian Archaeological Association]], and then joint editor of its journal, Archaeologia Cambrensis, in 1854. Jones was also secretary of the [[Oxford Architectural Society]].&lt;/ref&gt; and was abandoned. Seddon also proposed replacing all the roofs in a steeper pitch, thinking the existing ones were poor sixteenth century work.&lt;ref&gt;We know that the church was still being thatched in the early eighteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The nave was in poorest condition and the walls were substantially rebuilt and the porch wholly replaced in the first phase in 1868-9, with Thomas Williams of Cardiff the contractor. The font was restored at this time. Traces of painted decoration were found in the nave,&lt;ref&gt;At the [[Reformation]] all the figurative paintings would have been obliterated with limewash, though they wouldn't have necessarily been destroyed, per se.&lt;/ref&gt; including a colossal [[St Christopher]] on the north wall opposite the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Hemp in (1931) 86(2) Archeaologia Cambrensis 405. St Christopher usually faces the entrance to the Church in his role as [[patron saint]] of travellers.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately this and other traces of [[fresco]]&lt;ref&gt;A fresco is where the painting is executed onto a fresh or wet plaster. With ''buon fresco'' (literally &quot;true fresco&quot;), paintings are executed using powder pigments ground and mixed to a paste with water. They become bound with the wall surface through the carbonation of the lime in the lime plaster. Lime putty (calcium hydroxide) sets through a process of carbonation with the water element evaporating off and atmospheric carbon dioxide being absorbed into the plaster to form calcium carbonate. As this process occurs, minute quantities of lime pass into the pigment layer and carbonate, thereby binding the pigments; http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/medieval-wall-paintings/medieval-wall-paintings.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; could not be saved; they were destroyed without a pictorial record of them having been made.&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Bowen, A History of Llanbadarn Fawr (a limited edition published under auspices of the Ysgol Cwmpadarn Centenary Celebration Joint committee/Gomer Press, Llandysul, 1979), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee considered an [[oak]] roof for the nave, but rejected it as too costly.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The tower and transepts were restored 1878â€“80 with a short [[spire]] similar to the original, but slated rather than oak-shingled. This work was done by Roderick Williams. The pulpit dates from this time. [[William Morris]], on behalf of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]], wrote to the vicar in 1877&lt;ref&gt;The SPAB was founded by [[William Morris]], [[Philip Webb]] and others, in that year, to oppose what they saw as destructive &quot;Restoration&quot;  of ancient buildings then occurring in [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[United Kingdom|Britain]]; Andrea Donovan, ''William Morris and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings'' (Routledge, London, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; asking for a less severe restoration. Unfortunately much had already been destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishlistedbuildings.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The chancel finally was restored 1880â€“1884. The chancel glass by Stephen Belham is to Seddonâ€™s designs.&lt;ref&gt;S. Belham &amp; Co. was a company established by Stephen Belham (1827â€“91) in 1865 on Buckingham Palace Road in London. The firm made several stained glass windows in Wales to the design of Seddon, and then by Henry Murray (1852â€“1929), who may have subsequently acquired the business; http://imagingthebible.llgc.org.uk/person/274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further repairs and fittings were done 1935â€“1936 by Caroe &amp; Passmore (primarily to the Lady Chapel), and in 1960 by George Pace (the interior porch, and light fittings).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-9832-church-of-st-padarn-llanbadarn-fawr#.VTBJOPnF-So. For the nineteenth century restoration generally, see G. Rees, &quot;Papers and correspondence about the restoration [by John Seddon] of Llanbadarn Fawr parish church, Cardiganshire, 1862â€“1870&quot; (1960) 10(5) Journal of Historical Society of the Church in Wales 53â€“65; Michael Darby, ''John Pollard Seddon'' (Victoria and Albert Museum, London, 1983), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum and chapel of St Padarn are the most recent works, aside from the re-casting and re-hanging of the peal of bells.

===The listing of the building===

[[File:An old cross in Llanbadarn Fawr (Cer) churchyard NLW3362993.jpg|thumb|One of the crosses in Llanbadarn Fawr, in the churchyard pre-1916]]

The church has been [[Listed buildings in Wales|listed]] grade I since 21 January 1964. It was listed grade I as being the pre-eminent mediaeval church of the region, with outstanding monuments and fine later nineteenth century fittings and stained glass.&lt;ref&gt;Additionally, see National Library of Wales SD/F/236-239 faculties 1878, 1906, 1925 and 1936; National Library of Wales, Llanbadarn Fawr PCC records; Lambeth Palace, ICBS 06854: restoration papers; Llanbadarn Fawr drwy'r canrifoedd/ through the centuries, 1994; Martin Harrison, ''Victorian Stained Glass'' (Barrie &amp; Jenkins, London, 1979), pp. 58â€“9: the glass by Belham; (1848) 7 The Ecclesiologist, pp. 250â€“1; Carmarthen Journal 1/8/1862, 3/1/1868, 23/2/1883, 19/9/1884, 25/5/1894; The Builder 21/8/1869, 26/7/1879, 3/7/1880, 19/4/1884; Building News 26/8/1870; The Welshman 24/1/1868, 24/11/1876, 15/3/1878, 9/6/1880; The British Architect, 1882 (plans by Seddon); J.O.

==Churchyard==

[[File:St Padarn's church, Llanbadarn Fawr - geograph.org.uk - 1452960.jpg|thumb|The north aspect of the church from the churchyard]]

The churchyard covers some two acres. Most of the [[headstone]]s in the [[churchyard]] are modern â€“ many of them are from the nineteenth century â€“ but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, contains some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the trees are certified as being over 500 years old.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early [[pond]], probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any [[monastic|conventual]] buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;On the north side of the church the buildings were, probably, a part of the old monastery, a pointed arch, and other circumstances in them, indicating great antiquity&quot;; Sir [[Samuel Rush Meyrick]], ''The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation'' (Longmans, London, 1810).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lewis Pugh Evans===

[[File:Lewis Pugh Evans VC IWM HU 93411.jpg|thumb|Lewis Pugh Evans, VC]]

[[Brigadier-General]] [[Lewis Pugh Evans]], of Lovesgrove, a [[World War I]] [[Victoria Cross]] recipient and former [[churchwarden]], is buried in the [[churchyard]]. His grave is marked by a simple [[slate]] [[headstone]] giving names and dates of birth and death.&lt;ref name=blvch&gt;[http://www.victoriacross.org/cowalnor.htm] Burial Location VC Holders in North Wales.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a kinsman of Major-General Lewis Pugh, who is commemorated in the south transept. Evans was awarded the VC when, as an acting [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in [[The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders)]], on 4 October 1917, near [[Zonnebeke]], [[Belgium]], he was Commanding Officer of the 1st [[Battalion]], The [[Lincolnshire Regiment]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;For most conspicuous bravery and leadership. Lt.-Col. Evans took his battalion in perfect order through a terrific enemy barrage, personally formed up all units, and led them to the assault. While a strong machine gun emplacement was causing casualties, and the troops were working round the flank, Lt.-Col. Evans rushed at it himself and by firing his revolver through the loophole forced the garrison to capitulate. After capturing the first objective he was severely wounded in the shoulder, but refused to be bandaged, and re-formed the troops, pointed out all future objectives, and again led his battalion forward. Again badly wounded, he nevertheless continued to command until the second objective was won, and, after consolidation, collapsed from loss of blood. As there were numerous casualties, he refused assistance, and by his own efforts ultimately reached the Dressing Station.
His example of cool bravery stimulated in all ranks the highest valour and determination to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30400 |supp=yes |startpage=12327 |date=23 November 1917 |accessdate=15 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Evans was [[mention in despatches|mentioned in despatches]] seven times and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=29240 |supp=yes |startpage=7280 |date=24 July 1915 |accessdate=15 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Medal bar|Bar]], the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=30302 |supp=yes |startpage=9861 |date=21 September 1917 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French [[Croix de guerre 1914â€“1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]]. He was made a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=13453 |supp=yes |startpage=1826 |date=5 June 1919 |accessdate=15 November 2010 |city=e }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34518 |supp=yes|startpage=3687 |date=7 June 1938 |accessdate=15 November 2010 }}. He also had the 1914 Star and Clasp, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[Justice of the Peace]] on the local bench as well as [[Deputy Lieutenant]] for [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=34451 |startpage=6899 |date=5 November 1937 |accessdate=15 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman]] of the [[borough]] of Aberystwyth. He was also an Officer of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=35203 |startpage=3674 |date=27 June 1941 |accessdate=15 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the [[Imperial War Museum]], London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/vvashcr3.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991 a memorial plaque has been on the wall near the [[village]] [[war memorial]].

===Ancillary building===

A lean-to structure at the end of the north transept houses the heating system. There is a new western end to this building, constructed 2014, and the eastern end (which includes the entrance) can only be entered via the north door to the choir vestry.

===The churchyard gates===

The churchyard gate to the south west of the church is [[Listed buildings in Wales|listed]] grade II (26 October 2002). Given the relative size of the churchyard, the church and each of the two gates have their own [[postcode]]: the postal address of the church is Primrose Hill, Llanbadarn Fawr, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion SY23 3QZ, the postcode of the west gate is SY23 3QY.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-27048-churchyard-gate-to-sw-of-church-of-st-pad/ &quot;Churchyard gate to SW of Church of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr&quot; British Listed Buildings].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[lychgate]] to the south east is also [[Listed buildings in Wales|listed]] grade II (25 October 2002), and is located at SY23 3RA.&lt;ref name=&quot;See 2006 p. 494-497&quot;/&gt; It is a stone gabled lychgate with arched entries and good iron gates. It dates from 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-27047-lychgate-to-se-of-church-of-st-padarn-lla/ &quot;Lychgate to SE of Church of St Padarn, Llanbadarn Fawr&quot; British Listed Buildings].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Padarn's church, Llanbadarn Fawr - geograph.org.uk - 1452968.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the south west gate]]

===The Church Hall===

There is a modern church hall just outside the grounds of the church, to the west of the church. This was restored in 2000.
