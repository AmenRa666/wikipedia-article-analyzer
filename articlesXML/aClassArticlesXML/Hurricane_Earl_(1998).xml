'''Hurricane Earl''' was an atypical, short-lived [[SSHS#Category 2|Category 2 hurricane]] that caused moderate damage throughout the [[Southeast United States]]. It formed out of a poorly organized tropical disturbance over the southwest [[Gulf of Mexico]] late on August&amp;nbsp;31, 1998. Tracking towards the northeast, the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane on September&amp;nbsp;2 and made landfall early the next day near [[Panama City, Florida]]. Rapidly tracking towards [[Atlantic Canada]], the [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] remnants of Earl significantly intensified before passing over Newfoundland on September&amp;nbsp;6. The remnants were absorbed by former [[Hurricane Danielle (1998)|Hurricane Danielle]] two days later.

Moderate beach erosion occurred along the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida as waves reached {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Throughout Florida, nearly 2,000 homes were damaged and a few were destroyed. Severe flooding caused by [[storm surge]] and heavy rains was the main cause of damage in the state. Offshore, two men drowned after their boat capsized during the storm. A minor [[tornado outbreak]] took place in relation to Earl in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. A tornado in South Carolina killed one person after completely destroying the occupants home. In all, three people were killed by Earl and damages were $79&amp;nbsp;million (1998 USD; $104.4&amp;nbsp;million 2009 USD).

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Earl 1998 track.png}}
Hurricane Earl originated out of a strong [[tropical wave]] that moved off the west coast of Africa on August&amp;nbsp;17. By August&amp;nbsp;23, a weak [[Low pressure area|area of low pressure]] developed within the wave and well-developed [[Atmospheric convection|convective activity]] was present as it  tracked through the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Once in the [[Caribbean Sea]], strong [[wind shear]] produced by the [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] of [[Hurricane Bonnie (1998)|Hurricane Bonnie]] inhibited further development of the system. As it remained well-defined, satellites easily followed the low pressure into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. By August&amp;nbsp;31, the storm had become sufficiently organized for the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) to classify it as Tropical Depression Five. At this time, the depression was located roughly halfway between [[Merida, Mexico|Merida]] and [[Tampico, Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=November 17, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Hurricane Earl Tropical Cyclone Report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1998earl.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operationally, the NHC immediately classified the system as Tropical Storm Earl based on a [[Hurricane Hunter]] [[Reconnaissance mission]] that found flight-level winds of 49&amp;nbsp;mph (79&amp;nbsp;km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 40&amp;nbsp;mph (65&amp;nbsp;km/h). Due to the existence of multiple circulation centers, the initial movement of the storm was uncertain, but forecasters anticipated a general northward movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pasch|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=August 31, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Tropical Storm Earl Discussion One|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NAL0598.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In post-season analysis, it was determined that the system intensified into Tropical Storm Earl while located about 575&amp;nbsp;miles (925&amp;nbsp;km) south-southwest of [[New Orleans]]. Initial advisories on Earl relocated the center of circulation several times before focusing on the true circulation center.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt;

By September&amp;nbsp;1, the storm began to consolidate, with reconnaissance flights finding an elongated center and surface winds of 60&amp;nbsp;mph (95&amp;nbsp;km/h). Moderate wind shear inhibited convective development in the western portion; however, outflow in other areas of the storm improved, leading to further development. A northwest track, fully identified by this time as a [[Troposphere|mid-tropospheric]] [[High pressure area|ridge]] located over [[Florida]], strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Avila|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=September 1, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Four|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NAL0598.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining disorganized, Earl continued to intensify as the center of circulation was located close to deep convection. The NHC stated in their fifth advisory on the storm that Earl did not appear to be fully tropical due to the lack of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pasch|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=September 1, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Five|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NAL0598.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1200&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;2, Earl intensified into a hurricane despite having an atypical structure; the wind field of the storm was asymmetric and the strongest winds were located well to the southeast of the center.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Ob981230 lg3.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricanes Danielle and Earl on September&amp;nbsp;3]]
Several hours after becoming a hurricane, Earl further intensified into a [[SSHS#Category 2|Category 2 hurricane]] on the [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale]]; this observation was based on a flight-level winds of 119&amp;nbsp;mph (192&amp;nbsp;km/h), which corresponded to surface winds of 100&amp;nbsp;mph (155&amp;nbsp;km/h). The storm did not feature an [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] or partial eyewall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Avila|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=September 2, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Hurricane Earl Discussion Ten|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NAL0598.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central [[barometric pressure]] continued to fall despite the fact that the storm was beginning to weaken. Around 0000&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;3, the central pressure decreased to 985&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg); however, winds also decreased to 90&amp;nbsp;mph (150&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt; As Earl neared [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], cloud tops significantly warmed, indicating weakening, and the overall structure of the storm became less organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pasch|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=September 3, 1998|title=Hurricane Earl Discussion Eleven|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NAL0598.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 0600&amp;nbsp;UTC (1:00&amp;nbsp;am EDT) on September&amp;nbsp;3, Hurricane Earl made landfall near [[Panama City, Florida]] with winds of 80&amp;nbsp;mph (130&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt; Shortly after landfall, the storm weakened to a tropical storm and rapidly accelerated as it quickly underwent an [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical transition]]. By this time the NHC issued their final advisory on Earl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rappaport|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=September 3, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Tropical Storm Earl Discussion Thirteen (Final)|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/dis/NAL0598.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several hours later, Earl finished its transition and continued to rapidly track through the [[Southeast United States]]. After entering the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the remnants of Earl began re-intensify due to the effects of a [[baroclinic zone]]. Relatively cool [[sea surface temperatures]] near [[Atlantic Canada]] prevented tropical development; however, during a 36-hour span, Earl [[Rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]], as the central barometric pressure decreased by 40&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 1.18&amp;nbsp;inHg) to 957&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 28.26&amp;nbsp;inHg).&lt;ref name=&quot;ETReport&quot;/&gt; By the time the system made landfall over eastern [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]],  sustained winds had intensified to 65&amp;nbsp;mph (100&amp;nbsp;km/h). On September&amp;nbsp;8, the remnants of Earl significantly weakened and were soon absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone associated with the remnants of [[Hurricane Danielle (1998)|Hurricane Danielle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt;

==Preparations==
[[File:Hurricane Earl 1998.gif|thumb|left|Earl upon being upgraded to a hurricane on September&amp;nbsp;2]]
As Earl tracked towards the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on September&amp;nbsp;1, a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane warning]] was issued for coastal areas between [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] and [[Cameron, Louisiana]]. Additionally, hurricane watches extended out to [[Destin, Florida]] and [[High Island, Texas]] from the edges of the warning respectively. Early the next day, a tropical storm warning was issued for areas between Pascagoula, Mississippi and Destin, Florida. In response to the eastward movement of the hurricane, the hurricane watch and warning was discontinued for areas west of [[Morgan City, Louisiana]]. Additionally, the hurricane warning was extended eastward to Destin, Florida, a tropical storm warning was issued east of Destin to [[Apalachicola, Florida]], and a tropical storm watch was declared for areas between Morgan City and Cameron, Louisiana. Several hours later, the hurricane warning was again extended eastward to the mouth of the [[Suwannee River]]. All watches and warnings were discontinued for areas west of Pascagoula, Mississippi and due to the asymmetrical structure of Hurricane Earl, a tropical storm warning was issued as far south as the [[Florida Keys]]. Continuing uncertainty in the track of Earl prompted the issuance of a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning for areas between Pascagoula, Mississippi and [[Grand Isle, Louisiana]], including the city of [[New Orleans]]. After Earl made landfall in Florida, all watches and warnings were discontinued in relation to the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCR&quot;/&gt;

Offshore, several oil and natural gas rigs were evacuated due to the proximity of Earl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cliff Edwards|agency=Associated Press|date=September 2, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Natural gas tumbles as Hurricane Earl sidesteps major producing areas|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19516002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 10,000 workers were evacuated from both onshore and offshore rigs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCLA1&quot;/&gt; The storm forced many Florida residences to evacuate, especially people living in the barrier islands along the Florida Gulf Coast. About 30 [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] jets from [[Eglin Air Force Base]] were sent to [[Oklahoma]] to protect them from the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB1&quot;/&gt; A mandatory evacuation was issued for 20,000 residents in [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]] as well as all barrier islands along the Florida coast due to the risk of substantial flooding. [[Franklin County, Florida|Franklin County]] was briefly under a mandatory evacuation order on September&amp;nbsp;2, the reasons for the lifting of the order are unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Bill Kaczor|agency=Associated Press|date=September 3, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Hurricane Earl hits Florida's Panhandle|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19516324.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; State parks along the Florida Panhandle were also closed and highways became congested with thousands of residents and tourists evacuating the barrier islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB4&quot;/&gt;

Along the Louisiana coastline, voluntary evacuation orders were given out.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Associated Press|author=Bill Kaczor|date=September 2, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Earl veers eastward and grows into hurricane|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19515880.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[state of emergency]] was declared for portions of southeast Louisiana as tides in relation to the storm were forecast to reach {{convert|7|to|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Emergency shelters were opened throughout [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]], schools were closed in many areas, and the floodgates around New Orleans were shut.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB2&quot;/&gt; An estimated 5,000 people evacuated to inland areas throughout Louisiana.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCLA1&quot;/&gt; In [[Nueces County, Texas]], work crews worked quickly to clear garbage along the streets and picked up trash cans to avoid possible problems with clogged drains.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Catherine Wilson|agency=Associated Press|date=September 2, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Tropical Storm Earl expected to become hurricane and hit Gulf coast|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19515539.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Alabama and Mississippi coasts, schools were closed due to the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;HB4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Bill Koczar|agency=Associated Press|date=September 2, 1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Hurricane Earl veers toward Florida coast|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19516017.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Throughout the [[Southeast United States]], Hurricane Earl killed three people and caused $79&amp;nbsp;million (1998 USD; $104.4&amp;nbsp;million 2009 USD) in damages.

[[Image:Earl 1998 rainfall.gif|left|thumb|Rainfall totals from Earl]]
Ahead of Hurricane Earl's landfall in Florida, several tornadoes were spawned along the [[Rainband|outer bands]] of the storm. The first tornado to touch down was a brief [[Fujita scale|F0]] that caused no known damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCFL1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Hinson|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Florida Event Report: F0 Tornado|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second tornado, rated F1, caused moderate damage to three homes and two buildings that were under-construction along its {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCFL2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Hinson|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Florida Event Report: F1 Tornado|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315186}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 15-minute span, three brief F0 tornadoes touched down in unpopulated areas, causing minor tree damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCFL3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Hinson|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Florida Event Report: F0 Tornado|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCFL4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Hinson|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Florida Event Report: F0 Tornado|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCFL5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Hinson|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Florida Event Report: F0 Tornado|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several hours later, a strong F1 tornado touched down in [[Port Canaveral, Florida|Port Canaveral]].

[[File:Gail-1998-Hurricane-Earl.jpg|thumb|right|Flooding in [[Navarre Beach, Florida]]]]
Upon making landfall in Florida early on September&amp;nbsp;3, Earl produced a [[storm surge]] up to {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the [[Big Bend (Florida)|Big Bend]], inundating coastal communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCFL8&quot;/&gt; Torrential rains, peaking at {{convert|16.36|in|mm|abbr=on}} around Panama City, fell throughout the [[Florida Panhandle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HPC&quot;/&gt; Significant beach erosion was recorded in Walton County, Carrabelle Beach and Alligator Point. The most extensive damage occurred in [[Bay County, Florida|Bay County]] where 1,112 structures damaged by flooding and three were destroyed. In Panama City, upwards of {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water flooded homes. An estimated 7,100 residents in Bay County lost power during the storm. Florida officials temporarily shut down numerous major roadways, including [[Florida State Road 77|State Road 77]] due to high water. Portions of two roads in coastal [[Liberty County, Florida|Liberty County]] were destroyed due to beach erosion. In [[Gulf County, Florida|Gulf County]], 300 homes were damaged by high winds and floodwaters. An estimated 8,700 people lost power in the county during the storm. At [[Port St. Joe]], Earl's storm surge inundated 14 businesses and caused a water main break in the Lighthouse Utilities facility. In [[Franklin County, Florida|Franklin County]], storm surge damaged 136 homes and 15 businesses and led to a temporary closure of the St. George Causeway.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCFL8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Hinson|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Florida Event Report: Hurricane|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315182}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lighthouse on St. George Island was also destroyed by the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beach&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of Environmental Protection|publisher=State of Florida|year=1999|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Beach and Dune Erosion and Structural Damage and Post-Storm Recovery Plan for the Panhandle Coast of Florida|url=http://www.dep.state.fl.us/beaches/publications/pdf/erlgeorg.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 50 people were stranded in [[Alligator Point]] after floodwaters washed out the main access route to the town. In [[Wakulla County, Florida|Wakulla County]], 216 homes and businesses were damaged by high winds and flooding. Severe flooding in coastal [[Taylor County, Florida|Taylor County]] caused significant damage in nine communities. County officials reported that 66 structures were damaged by Earl. Five homes were destroyed and 39 others were damaged by flooding in [[Dixie County, Florida|Dixie County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCFL8&quot;/&gt; In [[Highlands County, Florida|Highlands County]], one person was injured after being struck by lightning.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCFL9&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Hinson|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=Florida Event Report: Lightning|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~315212}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September&amp;nbsp;3, the strongest tornado spawned by Earl in Florida touched down in [[Citrus County, Florida|Citrus County]]. Rated F2, the tornado tracked for {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}}, destroying eight homes and damaging 24 others. Several trees and power lines were also downed.

Ahead of Earl, an onshore flow related to the storm produced {{convert|6|to|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} swells along the Georgia coast, causing significant damage to marinas. The Mar Lin Marina sustained the most damage from this event; all the docks were destroyed, 30 boats were damaged and six were destroyed.

[[File:ET_Remnants_of_Earl_over_SC.png|thumb|right|The extratropical remnants of Earl over the Southeast]]
The extratropical remnants continued through the Southern United States, tracking through the [[Carolinas]] late on September&amp;nbsp;3. Sustained winds in South Carolina reached 50&amp;nbsp;mph (85&amp;nbsp;km/h) and gusted up to 70&amp;nbsp;mph (110&amp;nbsp;km/h). Widespread rainfall, generally amounting between {{convert|2|and|4|in|mm|abbr=on}}, fell in areas previously saturated by Hurricane Bonnie, this triggered minor flooding along roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCSC1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Hinson|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=South Carolina Event Report: F0 Tornado|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~339821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inland, isolated amounts of {{convert|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain fell.&lt;ref name=&quot;HPC&quot;/&gt; The first tornado related to Earl touched down in [[Choppee, South Carolina|Choppee]], located in [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown County]].

Rated F2, the tornado tracked for {{convert|18|mi|km|abbr=on}} through [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort]] and [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton Counties]], destroying 13 homes and damaging 13 others. One mobile home was flipped in the air and was completely destroyed once it hit the ground, instantly killing the occupant of the home. Numerous trees were uprooted and snapped along its path.

Still recovering from Hurricane Bonnie, the remnants of Earl produced widespread rain over North Carolina, triggering flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;HPC&quot;/&gt; Upwards of {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} fell in localized areas, causing small streams to overflow their banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCDCNC5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Hinson|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1998|accessdate=June 7, 2009|title=North Carolina Event Report: Flash Flood|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~333723}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Union County, North Carolina|Union County]], up to 15 roads were shut down due to flooding, a few cars were also washed off roads at the height of the floods.
