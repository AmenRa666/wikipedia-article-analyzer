'''Hurricane Chantal''' was one of three [[tropical cyclone]]s to make landfall in Texas during the [[1989 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The third named storm and the first hurricane of the season, Chantal slowly developed on July 30 in the southern Gulf of Mexico from a tropical disturbance that was previously within [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) while near [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. While heading north-northwestward, the depression steadily intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal on the following day. Thereafter, Chantal quickly strengthen and became a hurricane on August&amp;nbsp;1. After intensifying slightly further, Chantal made landfall near [[High Island, Texas]] later that day. The storm quickly weakened upon moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity a few hours after landfall. Early on August&amp;nbsp;2, Chantal weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over [[Oklahoma]] by August&amp;nbsp;4.

While making landfall in Texas, the storm produced relatively small tides, with most locations reporting waves less than {{convert|4|ft|m}} in height. However, some locations experienced extensive beach erosion. In addition, there were numerous rescues made by the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]. Due to both rainfall and high winds at least 3,000&amp;nbsp;homes were damaged, and numerous trees and sign were knocked down. Two tornadoes were reported, with one causing the destruction of a shed in [[Crystal Beach, Texas]], and the other knocking over several trees and mobile homes in [[Iota, Louisiana]]. Elsewhere, Chantal and its remnants brought light to moderate rainfall to several other states, although affects were minor in other states. Overall, 13&amp;nbsp;fatalities occurred, all of which due to drowning, and at least $100&amp;nbsp;million (1989&amp;nbsp;USD) in damage was reported.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Chantal 1989 track.png}}
The origins of Hurricane Chantal can be tracked back to a tropical disturbance within the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Trinidad and Tobago on July&amp;nbsp;24. The system crossed westward over the [[Caribbean Sea]], and there were no signs of organization until July&amp;nbsp;27 near the coast of [[Honduras]]. Despite the predictions for slow development from the tropical weather outlooks, it was possible that the system developed a surface low center near [[Belize City]], [[Belize]] late on July&amp;nbsp;28. After the system moved inland over the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], it became disorganized, although the [[National Hurricane Center]] indicated in the tropical weather outlook that once it moved into the Gulf of Mexico there was potential for development. Although the outflow of the system had appeared impressive on satellite images, the potential for development seemed uncertain, mostly due to the close proximity to land. The storm quickly became better organized based on satellite data and ship reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC prelim1&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/chantal/prelim01.gif|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Chantal: 30&amp;nbsp;July to 3&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1989|author=Harold P.

[[File:Chantal jul 31 1989 1925Z.jpg|thumb|right|Tropical Storm Chantal on July 31]]
Almost immediately after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July&amp;nbsp;30, the cloud pattern of system quickly became better organized. Later after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, ships and satellite images confirmed that Tropical Depression Four had formed offshore of the north coast of the Yucatán Peninsula; although it was likely that the depression formed 80&amp;nbsp;miles (129&amp;nbsp;km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula several hours earlier than confirmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC prelim1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Season Summary&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1989.pdf|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1989|author=Robert A. Case and B. Max Mayfield|date=May 1990|publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]|accessdate=January 9, 2013|series=Monthly Weather Reviews|location=Miami, Florida|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following morning after development occurred, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm 575&amp;nbsp;miles (920&amp;nbsp;km) southeast of Texas; the National Hurricane Center assigned it to the name Chantal.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC prelim1&quot; /&gt; Although it became a tropical storm early that morning, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm until a reconnaissance flight confirmed tropical storm force winds about six hours later, when sustained winds were already 50&amp;nbsp;mph (85&amp;nbsp;km/h). Tropical Storm Chantal rapidly strengthened thereafter, with weather satellites indicating t–numbers increasing from 2.5&amp;nbsp;to 3.5&amp;nbsp;within twelve hours using the [[Dvorak technique]]. Chantal continued to intensify, and headed northwestward at 11&amp;nbsp;mph (18&amp;nbsp;km/h) due to weak ridging over [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC prelim2&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/chantal/prelim02.gif|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Chantal: 30&amp;nbsp;July to 3&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1989|page=2|author=Harold P. Gerrish|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 9, 2013|format=GIF|series=Hurricane Chantal, Hurricane Wallet Digital Archives|location=Miami, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on July&amp;nbsp;31, satellite imagery revealed better organization, and another reconnaissance flight found winds at 91&amp;nbsp;mph (151&amp;nbsp;km/h) while flying at 1500&amp;nbsp;feet (457&amp;nbsp;m). Based on these observations, it was estimated that Chantal had intensified into a hurricane early on August&amp;nbsp;1. Hurricane Chantal continued to intensify, slightly, and attained its peak intensity on August&amp;nbsp;1 at 1000&amp;nbsp;UTC, reaching [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 80&amp;nbsp;mph (130&amp;nbsp;km/h) and a minimum [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|986|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Only three hours thereafter, Hurricane Chantal made landfall near [[High Island, Texas]] with winds still at 80&amp;nbsp;mph (130&amp;nbsp;km/h). Chantal rapidly weakened to a tropical storm at 1800&amp;nbsp;UTC on August&amp;nbsp;2, just five hours after landfall, and quickly degenerated to a tropical depression early on August&amp;nbsp;2. Tropical Depression continued its course and eventually dissipated over western [[Oklahoma]] on August&amp;nbsp;3. The remnants of Chantal then moved northward over the [[Great Plains]] and was tracked northward over [[New York (state)|New York]], eventually reaching [[New England]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] just before [[Hurricane Dean (1989)|Hurricane Dean]] approached.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHC prelim2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr3&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/chantal/prelim03.gif|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Chantal: 30&amp;nbsp;July to 3&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1989|page=3|author=Harold P. Gerrish|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 9, 2013|format=GIF|series=Hurricane Chantal, Hurricane Wallet Digital Archives|location=Miami, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations==
At 0000&amp;nbsp;UTC on July&amp;nbsp;31, a tropical storm watch &amp;ndash; indicating tropical storm force winds were possible within 48&amp;nbsp;hours &amp;ndash; was issued from [[Port O'Connor, Texas]] to the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]]. Three hours thereafter, a hurricane warning &amp;ndash; signifying that hurricane-force winds were likely in 24&amp;nbsp;hours or less &amp;ndash; was issued from [[Freeport, Texas]] to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]]. A tropical storm warning was simultaneously put into effect from Port O'Connor, Texas to [[Mobile, Alabama]], significantly overlapping the existing hurricane warning. The tropical storm warning was discontinued at 1000&amp;nbsp;UTC on August&amp;nbsp;1. Six hours later, the hurricane warning issued at 0300&amp;nbsp;UTC on July&amp;nbsp;31 was downgraded to a tropical storm warning, before the portion from [[Port Arthur, Texas]] to Morgan City, Louisiana was canceled. The remaining portion from Freeport to Port O'Connor, Texas was discontinued at 0100&amp;nbsp;UTC on August&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/chantal/prelim13.gif|title=Table 3. Warnings issued for Hurricane Chantal, July and August&amp;nbsp;1989|author=Harold P. Gerrish|date=1989|publisher=National Hurricane Center|page=13|accessdate=January 9, 2013|format=GIF|location=Miami, Florida|series=Hurricane Chantal, Hurricane Wallet Digital Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings]], several other actions were taken as Chantal approached. More than 600&amp;nbsp;oil workers were moved inland,&lt;ref name=&quot;re&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pEcyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=veUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6260,9718&amp;dq=hurricane+chantal+evacuations&amp;hl=en|title=Thousands Flee As Hurricane Chantal hits Texas|date=August 1, 1989|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|page=2|accessdate=January 9, 2013|location=High Island, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a man drowned while attempting to evacuate a [[Oil platform|rig]] south of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr4&quot;/&gt; Mayor of Port Arthur Malcolm Grant asked 800&amp;nbsp;residents to evacuate [[Sabine Pass, Port Arthur, Texas|Sabine Pass]], due to potential coastal flooding isolating the area. Shelters were opened at various schools in Port Arthur and [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]. In nearby [[Orange, Texas|Orange]], crews at emergency centers distributed sand bags. About 8,500&amp;nbsp;residents of [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana]] evacuated, with at least 67&amp;nbsp;people taking shelter at a school in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]]. An additional 2,500&amp;nbsp;people fled [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]], as the threat of the only road to the island flooding loomed.&lt;ref name=&quot;re&quot;/&gt;

==Impact==
Texas bore the brunt of the storm, where strong winds and heavy rainfall damaged about 3,000&amp;nbsp;homes and knocked downed numerous trees and signs.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr3&quot;/&gt; Chantal also spawned two tornadoes, one in [[Crystal Beach, Texas]] and the other in [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana]]; both of which caused minor damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr3&quot;/&gt; Additionally, 13&amp;nbsp;fatalities occurred, all of them due to drowning; 11&amp;nbsp;deaths occurred offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, while the remaining two were reported in east-central Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr4&quot;/&gt; Overall, the storm resulted in at least $100&amp;nbsp;million (1989&amp;nbsp;USD) in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr3&quot;/&gt;

===Mexico===
Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone, the precursor tropical disturbance dropped rainfall on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]]. The precipitation put out fires burning in the region, which had destroyed up to {{convert|370000|acre|ha|lk=on}} of jungle in the two months prior to the tropical disturbance, according to the Agriculture Department of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D2ZIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ywYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=hurricane%20chantal%20warning&amp;pg=4976%2C946119|title=Chantal does little damage in Texas|author=Jeff Avyalt|agency=Associated Press|date=August 2, 1989|newspaper=[[Star-Banner]]|accessdate=January 9, 2013|page=27|location=High Island, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===
[[File:Chantal_1989_rainfall.png|thumb|right|Rainfall totals in the United States associated with Hurricane Chantal]]

====Galveston County====
The worst effects from the storm occurred in [[Galveston County, Texas|Galveston County]]. Waves of 7&amp;nbsp;feet (2&amp;nbsp;m) in height were reported on High Island during Chantal, while [[Kemah, Texas|Kemah]] measured tides of 3.8&amp;nbsp;feet (1.1&amp;nbsp;m), and the Galveston Flagship pier reported 3.5&amp;nbsp;feet (1&amp;nbsp;m) seas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Season Summary&quot; /&gt; The high tides eroded more than {{convert|1|mi|km}} of [[Texas State Highway 87]], while at least another {{convert|15|mi|km}} of that highway was covered in sand and debris. As a result, the highway was expected to be closed for at least five weeks,&lt;ref name=&quot;stormdata&quot;/&gt; though in October&amp;nbsp;1989, storm surge from [[Hurricane Jerry (1989)|Hurricane Jerry]] caused more erosion, and no repairs have been made since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/jerry/prelim03.gif|title=Hurricane Jerry Preliminary Report|author=B.

Roth|date=May 14, 2007|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|accessdate=January 9, 2013|location=College Park, Maryland|series=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center's Rainfall  Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous streets in [[League City, Texas|League City]], [[Dickinson, Texas|Dickinson]], and Friendswood were flooded for more than 24&amp;nbsp;hours. At least 100&amp;nbsp;homes in Friendswood were flooded, while water entered 70% of houses in Dickinson. Severe street flooding and ponding occurred in Galveston, especially in the low-lying areas; some homes and businesses were damaged, as a result. Overall, 500&amp;nbsp;homes in the county were flooded.&lt;ref name=&quot;stormdata&quot;/&gt;

Strong winds also effected the county, with the highest recorded sustained wind speed being {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in Galveston; the highest gust of {{convert|83|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} was reported at the same location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Season Summary&quot;/&gt; At the [[National Weather Service]] Office in Downtown Galveston, sustained winds were {{convert|53|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and gusts reached {{convert|69|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Although winds were strong, associated losses was confined to roof damage at beach homes in [[Gilchrist, Texas|Gilchrist]] and [[High Island, Texas|High Island]]. In addition to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high tides, the storm also produced one tornado in the county. Rated as an F0 on the [[Fujita scale]], the tornado was spawned in Crystal Beach, where it destroyed a boat shed; elsewhere, no damage occurred from this twister.&lt;ref name=&quot;stormdata&quot;/&gt;

====Harris County====
Rainfall produced by Chantal in the city of [[Houston]] alone varied extensively, with 7.14&amp;nbsp;inches (181&amp;nbsp;mm) at [[William P. Hobby Airport]] after twenty-four hours, and only 1.21&amp;nbsp;inches (31&amp;nbsp;mm) at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] (then known as Houston Intercontinental Airport) in the same time lapse. In the southern portions of [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], rainfall totaled ranged from {{convert|8|to|12|in|mm}}. Significant amounts of precipitation resulted in flooding, which in turn, caused several hundred emergency crew rescues and damage to at least 500&amp;nbsp;homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;stormdata&quot;/&gt; Strong winds also caused significant effects in the county. In [[La Porte, Texas|La Porte]], where winds gusted to {{convert|70|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, 40&amp;nbsp;trees were toppled at a golf course, while a plane was flipped over at the [[La Porte Municipal Airport (Texas)|La Porte Municipal Airport]]. The roof of a mobile home was torn off and a fence and a portable building was destroyed in [[Highlands, Texas|Highlands]]. Winds damaged a [[American Red Cross|red cross]] shelter in [[Pasadena, Texas|Pasadena]] and blew out several windows at a hospital in [[Baytown, Texas|Baytown]]. Throughout the county, high winds destroyed 2&amp;nbsp;mobile homes and damaged 49&amp;nbsp;apartments and 24&amp;nbsp;businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;stormdata&quot;/&gt;

====Elsewhere in Texas====
Heavy rainfall effected [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]], where precipitation amounts up to {{convert|12|in|mm}} were reported; this caused significant flooding, especially in [[Pearland, Texas|Pearland]] and [[Manvel, Texas|Manvel]]. During the height of the storm, the entire town of Manvel was inundated with water, causing flood damage to at least 100&amp;nbsp;homes. Additionally, high winds in combination with floods damaged about 500&amp;nbsp;homes throughout the county. In [[Chambers County, Texas|Chambers County]] high winds caused two injuries and tore roofing material off of homes and mobile homes; about 100&amp;nbsp;homes were effected in the area. {{convert|6|in|mm}} of rain fell in the southern portions of the county, causing minor flooding. Between {{convert|8|and|12|in|mm}} of precipitation was recorded in eastern [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort Bend County]]. In the city of [[Fresno, Texas|Fresno]], at least 60&amp;nbsp;homes were flooded and several families were evacuated. After {{convert|9.7|in|mm}} of rain fell in [[Richmond, Texas|Richmond]], local flooding occurred. Several mobile homes in the county also suffered wind damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;stormdata&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/orders/IPS-E0088C99-5C8B-457B-90CA-064C83CB6AAD.pdf|title=Storm Data - August&amp;nbsp;1989|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|author=Jay Hollifield and S. C. Lackey|accessdate=January 9, 2013|location=Asheville, North Carolina|pages=30, 45–47, and 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazos County, Texas|Brazos County]], heavy rainfall caused street flooding in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stormdata&quot;/&gt; Precipitation in [[Collin County, Texas|Collin County]] reached as high as {{convert|16|in|mm}} in [[Clear Lake, Texas|Clear Lake]], though no flood damage was reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr3&quot;/&gt; Additionally, two fatalities occurred when two teenage boys were riding a rubber raft, swept into a drainpipe, and subsequently drowned.&lt;ref name=&quot;stormdata&quot;/&gt; The highest sustained wind speed recorded in [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]] was {{convert|54|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[Sea Rim State Park]], while the strongest gust was {{convert|49|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at the [[Jack Brooks Regional Airport]]. Winds downed trees and limbs, while also causing minor roof damage. Tides at [[Sabine Pass]] were about {{convert|3.9|ft|m}} about mean sea level; some beach erosion was reported near that location. In [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty County]], winds felled tree limbs, which damaged vehicles and portable buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;stormdata&quot;/&gt;

===Elsewhere===
One fatality was reported during an oil rig evacuation in the Gulf of Mexico. Ten other people perished when a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] capsized south of [[Morgan City, Louisiana]]. Four others on the boat were rescued by the [[United States Coast Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/chantal/prelim04.gif|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Chantal: 30&amp;nbsp;July to 3&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1989|author=Harold P.

The only known impact in [[Mississippi]] was tides of {{convert|2.6|ft|m}} above mean sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcr3&quot;/&gt;

Further north in the [[Midwestern United States]], impact was generally minor.
