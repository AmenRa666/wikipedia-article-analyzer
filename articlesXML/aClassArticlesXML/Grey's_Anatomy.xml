'''''Grey's Anatomy''''' is an American medical drama television series that premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) as a [[mid-season replacement]] on March 27, 2005.  The series focuses on the fictional lives of surgical [[internship (medicine)|interns,]] [[residency (medicine)|residents]], and attendings as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, while trying to maintain personal lives and relationships. The title is a play on ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', a human anatomy textbook by [[Henry Gray]]. The show's premise originated with [[Shonda Rhimes]], who serves as an executive producer, along with [[Betsy Beers]], [[Mark Gordon]], [[Krista Vernoff]], [[Rob Corn]], [[Mark Wilding]], and [[Allan Heinberg]]. Although the show is set in [[Seattle]] at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (Formerly Seattle Grace-Mercy West) it is primarily filmed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The show was originally titled ''Complications'' following the complicated medical procedures and personal lives of the cast. 

The series was created to be racially diverse, utilizing a [[color-blind casting]] technique. It revolves around the title character Dr. [[Meredith Grey]] played by [[Ellen Pompeo]]. The series' original cast consisted of nine star billed cast members including [[Ellen Pompeo]], [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Justin Chambers]], [[T. R. Knight]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens Jr.]], [[Isaiah Washington]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]]. The cast has undergone major changes throughout the run of the show, with many major cast members leaving and being replaced by [[List of Grey's Anatomy characters|several new characters]]. The series in its [[Grey's Anatomy (season 12)|twelfth season]] had a large ensemble of sixteen actors, including four from the original cast. On March 3, 2016, ABC renewed ''Grey's Anatomy'' for a thirteenth season, which premiered on September 22, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvguide.com/news/abc-fall-premiere-dates/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grey's Anatomy'' is one of the highest-rated dramas in the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|18–49 demographic]]. Although the ratings have fallen over the past few seasons, it was once among the overall top 10 shows in the United States. ''Grey's Anatomy'' has been well received by critics throughout much of its run, and was included in various critics' top ten lists in 2006. It is considered an impact on [[Popular culture|culture]] and has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Grey's Anatomy|numerous awards]]. It is also the recipient of the [[64th Golden Globe Awards|2007 Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama|Best Television Series&amp;nbsp;— Drama]], and multiple [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy nominations]], including two for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]]. The show has produced several specials, as well as distributed all seasons to DVD, and released a collection of merchandise. In 2012, ''Grey's Anatomy'' was named the fifth-highest revenue earning show, in terms of advertising per half-hour. It's the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|longest running scripted primetime show]] currently airing on ABC and the second longest scripted primetime show ever on ABC only behind ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''.

== Plot ==
The series follows [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), the daughter of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional [[Seattle Grace Hospital]]. During her tenure as a resident, Grey works alongside fellow doctors [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), and [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with the hectic work and training schedules assigned to them. They are overseen during their internship by [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]), a senior resident who works beneath Grey's love-interest [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), the head of neurosurgery; Yang's fiancee [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]), the head of cardio; and Ellis Grey's ex-lover [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]), the Chief of Surgery. The residents are later joined by [[Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]]) and [[April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]), former Mercy-West residents who join Seattle Grace following an administrative merger in the sixth season. Throughout the first six seasons O'Malley, Burke and Stevens all depart the series which has become very controversial in the media over the life-span of the series. In addition to Shepherd, Webber, and Burke, the surgical wing is primarily supervised by [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), as head of trauma; [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), as head of pediatric surgery; [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), a resident who later becomes head of orthopedic surgery, who left Seattle at the end of the twelfth season; [[Erica Hahn]] ([[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]]), as head of cardio; [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), as head of plastics; [[Addison Montgomery]] ([[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]]), as head of OB/GYN, neonatal, and fetal surgery; [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]), as head of cardio; and [[Amelia Shepherd]] ([[Caterina Scorsone]]), Derek's sister who is hired to replace him as head of neuro.

Later additions to the residency program include [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]), Meredith's half-sister. Grey is killed alongside Mark Sloan in the season eight finale; Leah Murphy ([[Tessa Ferrer]]); Shane Ross ([[Gaius Charles]]), who departs alongside Yang in the tenth season finale; Stephanie Edwards ([[Jerrika Hinton]]); Jo Wilson ([[Camilla Luddington]]), a doctor who begins a romantic relationship with Karev; Andrew Deluca ([[Giacomo Gianniotti]]), the love-interest of Meredith's half sister Maggie Pierce ([[Kelly McCreary]]), who also serves as head of cardio; and Benjamin Warren ([[Jason George]]), an anesthesiologist and currently a resident,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy|title=Watch Grey's Anatomy TV Show - ABC.com|website=ABC|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has to balance his wife Miranda Bailey's new role as Chief of Surgery with his own desire to succeed. Season twelve sees the arrival of Nathan Riggs ([[Martin Henderson]]), while Meredith is appointed head of general surgery.

==Production and development==

===Conception===
[[Shonda Rhimes]], the series' creator, wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching,&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;{{cite news|title=Shonda Rhimes, creator of 'Grey's Anatomy' and a Chicagoan of the Year|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/12/shonda_rhimes_a.html|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621165401/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/12/shonda_rhimes_a.html|archivedate=June 21, 2009 |last=Ryan|first=Maureen|date=December 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thought it would be interesting to create a show about &quot;smart women competing against one another&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt; When asked how she decided to develop a [[medical drama]], Rhimes responded: {{cquote|I was obsessed with the surgery channels. [...] My sisters and I would call each other up and talk about operations we'd seen on the Discovery Channel. There's something fascinating about the medical world—you see things you'd never imagine, like the fact that doctors talk about their boyfriends or their day while they're cutting somebody open. So when ABC asked me to write another pilot, the [operating room] seemed like the natural setting.&lt;ref name=oprah&gt;{{cite web|last=Winfrey|first=Oprah|title=Oprah Talks to Shonda Rhimes|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-Greys-Anatomy-Creator-Shonda-Rhimes/1|work=[[O: The Oprah Magazine|O, The Oprah Magazine]]|publisher=[[Harpo Productions|Harpo Productions, Inc]]|accessdate=May 24, 2012|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The series was pitched to ABC Entertainment, who gave the [[Green-light|green light]], and the show was picked up as a [[mid-season replacement]] for ''[[Boston Legal]]'' in the [[2004–05 United States network television schedule|2005 television season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;businesslibrary&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_12_60/ai_n15632370/ | title=Shonda Rhimes: the force behind Grey's Anatomy | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | work=Business Library | date=October 2005 | accessdate=May 24, 2012 | author=Collier, Aldore}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francie Calfo]], executive vice president of development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that &quot;[m]edical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [Rhimes] found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;
{{Quote box|quote=&quot;''ER'' is high-speed medicine. The camera flies around, adrenaline is rushing. My show is more personal. The idea for the series began when a doctor told me it was incredibly hard to shave her legs in the hospital shower. At first that seemed like a silly detail. But then I thought about the fact that it was the only time and place this woman might have to shave her legs. That's how hard the work is.&quot;|source=— Rhimes on the creation of ''Grey's Anatomy''&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt;|align=right|width=25em}}
Rhimes initially conceived ''Grey's Anatomy'' as a statement against racism. She endeavored to create a show that featured a racially diverse cast that allowed viewers to relate to characters regardless of race.&lt;ref name=inamerica&gt;{{cite news|last=Springer|first=Sarah|title='Grey's Anatomy' creator, actress discuss media diversity|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/22/greys-anatomy-creator-and-actress-discuss-media-diversity/|publisher=[[Cable News Network]]|work=InAmerica|accessdate=May 24, 2012|date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While creating characters, as well as writing the first script, the series' writers had no character descriptions in mind, and hoped to cast the best actor available for each part. Rhimes has explained that if the network did not allow her to create characters this way, she would have been hesitant about moving forward with the series.&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt; Female roles in particular were developed as multi-faceted characters.  Rhimes offered her insight on this, &quot;I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women. Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the bitch? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?&quot;&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt;

Before the series debuted on March 27, 2005, there were a few early releases to close friends and family of the producers and actors. The show was scheduled to run in the ''[[Boston Legal]]'' time slot for four weeks. However, high ratings and viewership led to it holding onto the slot for the remainder of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E2DA133EF937A25757C0A9639C8B63|title=Thriving Ratings for a New Patient on ABC|last=Rhodes|first=Joe|date=April 14, 2005|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC Entertainment President, Steve McPherson, commented on the scheduling change: &quot;Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let [''Grey's Anatomy''] build on its tremendous momentum through May.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,153085,00.html|title='Grey's Anatomy' Keeps Sunday Time Slot|date=April 11, 2005|work=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's title, ''Grey's Anatomy'', was devised as a play on words: a reference to both [[Henry Gray]]'s medical textbook, ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', and the title character [[Meredith Grey|Dr. Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]).&lt;ref name=GATD&gt;{{cite web|last=Case|first=Laura|title=Why Is Grey's Anatomy Called Grey's Anatomy? 5 Weird Fan Questions Answered by Wetpaint Entertainment|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/network/gallery/why-is-greys-anatomy-called-greys-anatomy-5-weird-fan-questions-answered-by-wetpaint-entertainment#4|publisher=The Cambio Network|work=[[Wetpaint]]|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from ''Grey's Anatomy'' to ''Complications'', although ultimately this did not come to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?date=02/04/05&amp;id=6822|title=Breaking News&amp;nbsp;– Development Updates: February 4|date=February 4, 2005|publisher=The Futon Critic|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhimes is the series' most prolific writer.

===Filming locations and technique===

[[File:Seattle Space Needle Crop.jpg|right|thumb|alt=The space needle in Seattle, Washington.|The Space Needle, in Seattle, is the background to many exterior shots.]]
Rhimes considered setting the medical drama in her hometown, [[Chicago]], but eventually decided to go with Seattle, to distinguish ''Grey's Anatomy'' from the Chicago–based ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.&lt;ref name=LAT1/&gt;

Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building of [[Fisher Communications]] and Fisher's ABC affiliated [[KOMO-TV|KOMO]] radio and television stations in [[Seattle]], is used for some exterior shots of Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital. In particular, [[air ambulance]]s land on the [[KOMO-TV]] newscopter's helipad. This suggests the hospital is close to the [[Space Needle]] (which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza), the [[Seattle Monorail]], and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and a few interior shots is not in Seattle; these scenes are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in [[North Hills, Los Angeles, California|North Hills]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|year=2005|title=Grey's Anatomy Season One DVD: Commentary Feature|publisher=[[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior of Meredith Grey's house, also known as the Intern House, is real. In the show, the address of Grey's home is 613 Harper Lane, but in real life there is no such place. The actual home is located at 303 W. Comstock St., Seattle, Washington. Most scenes are taped at Prospect Studios in [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]], just east of [[Hollywood]], where the ''Grey's Anatomy'' set occupies six sound stages. Some outside scenes are shot at the [[Magnuson Park|Warren G. Magnuson Park]] in Seattle.

==Series synopsis==

===Overview===
[[File:Greys Anatomy title.svg|right|thumb|270px|upright=1.3|Title screen|alt= The title screen of ''Grey{{'s}} Anatomy'']]
''Grey{{'}}s Anatomy'' follows the lives of [[Internship (medicine)|surgical interns]] and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, with the help of their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of the episode.&lt;ref name=GAMS&gt;{{cite web|last=Santucci|first=Pieracarla|title=Grey's Anatomy Made Simple|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/greys-anatomy-made-simple-4979.html?cat=39|work=[[Associated Content|Yahoo!

Although the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition.&lt;ref name=AntHit&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Matthew|title='Anatomy' of a hit|url=http://articles.boston.com/2006-05-07/ae/29241170_1_shonda-rhimes-political-drama-meredith-grey|publisher= Boston Globe Electronic Publishing Inc|work=[[Boston.com]]|date=May 7, 2006|accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The residents initially arrive at the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient.&lt;ref name=WABLTW&gt;{{cite episode|title=Winning a Battle, Losing the War|credits=Writer: Rhimes, Shonda. Director: Goldwyn, Tony|series=Grey's Anatomy|network=American Broadcasting Company|airdate=April 10, 2005|season=1|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hospital superior is in charge of assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors.&lt;ref name=WAH&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Wishin' and Hopin' (Grey's Anatomy)|Wishin' and Hopin']]|credits=Writers: Phelan, Tony and Rater, Joan.

Once assigned a case, each doctor [[diagnosis|diagnoses]] the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Each episode of the series displays this, towards the center of the episode.&lt;/ref&gt; The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life.&lt;ref name=ILYS&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]|credits=Writers: Phelan, Tony and Rater, Joan. Director: Deitch, Donna|series=Grey's Anatomy|network=American Broadcasting Company|airdate=January 21, 2010|season=6|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an [[indie rock]] background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawson&quot;/&gt; At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.&lt;ref name=&quot;karanovic.org&quot;/&gt;

===Critical response===

{{quote box|quote=&quot;Grey’s Anatomy offers a different and perhaps more valuable idea of what it means to be strong: the capacity to suffer terribly, break down completely, and then get up again, confident that you’re bigger than the sum of the tragedies you’ve suffered—because everyone else is, too. The layers of history have grown pretty dense and rich, and the friendships that form around them as the characters suffer and survive is the glue of the series, and what—despite a few inevitable hit-or-miss patches—elevates it to something special.&quot;- Laura Hudson of ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/2015/06/binge-guide-greys-anatomy/ | work=Wired | first=Laura | last=Hudson | title=WIRED Binge-Watching Guide: Grey's Anatomy | date=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right|width=30em}}

''Grey's Anatomy'' has been well received among critics. The show holds an average of 71% positive score on ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' and 7.7/10 score at ''[[Internet Movie Database|IMDB]]'' site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/|title=Grey's Anatomy (TV Series 2005– )|author=HaloFive00|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows in the quality of the hit medical drama saying, &quot;The quality arc for the show is all over the place, starting with a steady build in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 1)|first season]], then skyrocketing into phenomenon in [[Grey's Anatomy (season 2)|season two]], then leveling off and dipping in [[Grey's Anatomy (season 3)|season three]], before having some seriously bumpy moments in [[Grey's Anatomy (season 4)|seasons four]] (interrupted by the writers’ strike) and [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|five]].

Let me make it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season.&quot; adding, &quot;I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, ''Grey’s Anatomy'' has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as &quot;McDreamy.&quot;, the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if [[Shonda Rhimes]] has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run.&quot; The site lauded the show saying, &quot;On average, it’s been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a good [[Soap opera|soap]], a good [[List of romantic comedy television series|romantic comedy]], a good [[medical drama]], and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/02/28/greys-anatomy-season-10 | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Samantha | last=Highfill | title='Grey's Anatomy': What season 10 could learn from season 2 | date=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title character of ''Grey's Anatomy'', Meredith, has received both overwhelmingly positive and weary feedback by critics along the course of the show, with the development of the character garnering praise from majority critics.

Glenn Diaz of ''[[BuddyTV]]'' commented that &quot;You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy.&quot; The development of the character has received praise from critics. Reviewing the first part of the eighth season, TV Fanatic wrote: &quot;this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the ''heart and soul'' of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season.&quot; Rick Porter reviewing the episode [[How to Save a Life (Grey's Anatomy)|How to Save a Life]] from the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 11)|eleventh season]] for ''[[Zap2it]]'' wrote, &quot;Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, &quot;How to Save a Life&quot; would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. &quot;How to Save a Life&quot; may not be the ideal [[Emmy Award|Emmy-submission]] episode for Ellen Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/greys_anatomy_ellen_pompeo_saved_how_to_save_a_life-2015-04|title=&amp;apos;Grey&amp;apos;s Anatomy&amp;apos;: Ellen Pompeo totally saved &amp;apos;How to Save a Life&amp;apos;|work=Zap2It}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janalen Samson of ''[[BuddyTV]]'' lauded the Meredith's development throughout the series saying, &quot;When one considers how this character has grown over eleven seasons, it really is amazing.

McKidd and Capshaw were referred to as &quot;fresh additions&quot; to the series, by Monfette of ''[[IGN]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/988/988165p1.html|title=Grey's Anatomy: Season 5 Review |last=Monfette|first=Chris|work=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|date=May 29, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' commented: &quot;Hunt/McKidd is the most encouraging thing to happen to ''Grey's Anatomy'' in quite a while.&quot;&lt;ref name=TVGMR&gt;{{cite web|last=Roush|first=Matt|title=Ask Matt: Will Big Bang Make an Emmy Splash?

She’s no longer much less annoying than she used to be, and she’s honest. A girl with principles is a girl you want to do well.&quot; and described her and Avery as &quot;a couple for whom viewers can root&quot;. Speaking of the new cast members, in addition to the remaining original, Robert Bianco from ''[[USA Today]]'' called them the show's &quot;best ensemble in years&quot;.&lt;ref name=BEIY&gt;{{cite news|last=Bianco|first=Robert|title=These TV series are back, but are they better than ever?|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2010-10-06-returnees06_ST_N.htm|date=October 6, 2010|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding season three, Bill Carter of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called ''Grey's Anatomy'' &quot;television's hottest show&quot;, adding: &quot;[No show] is expected to challenge ''Grey's Anatomy'' for prime-time pre-eminence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hottest&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/business/media/09network.html?pagewanted=all | title=In TV Land This Season, a Few Happy Surprises but No Breakthrough Hits | publisher=The New York Times Company | work=The New York Times | date=October 9, 2006 | accessdate=August 16, 2012 | author=Carter, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting with Carter's view, Monfette of ''[[IGN]]'' said that it speedily found itself &quot;mired in the annoying and absurd&quot;, adding: &quot;This third season may very well represent a case of over-writing a concept that has, perhaps tragically, run bone-dry on narrative fuel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ignga3&quot;/&gt;  At the conclusion of season three, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Gregory Kirschling said &quot;the show lacked a defining happy, warm-gooseflesh moment&quot;, adding that the season &quot;didn't leave you dying for the [next] season premiere&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;yacha&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20039420,00.html | title=Yanging Our Chain Recap | publisher=Time Inc | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=May 20, 2007 | accessdate=August 16, 2012 | author=Kirschling, Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of the fourth season, Laura Burrows of ''[[IGN]]'' said the series became &quot;a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic&quot;, adding: &quot;This season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot.&quot;&lt;ref name=ignga4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/876/876534p1.html|publisher=News Corporation|work=IGN|title=Grey's Anatomy: Season 4 Review|date=May 27, 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the moderately negative feedback the third and fourth seasons received, [[Alan Sepinwall]] of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' said of the fifth season: &quot;Overall, it feels more like the good old days than ''Grey's Anatomy'' has in a long time.&quot; Misha Davenport from the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said season five &quot;hits on all the things the show does so well&quot;, adding: &quot;There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/greys-anatomy/season-5/critic-reviews|title=Grey's Anatomy Season 5 Critic Reviews|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Lowry of ''Variety'', less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines.&lt;ref name=varbri&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=Grey's Anatomy|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117938491?refCatId=31|work=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=September 24, 2008|accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of ''USA Today'' wrote: &quot;''Grey's'' has always loved grand gestures.

The ninth season received more positive reviews, Rob Salem of ''[[Toronto Star]]'' called it &quot;a solid return to form.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/tvreviews/2012/09/28/greys_anatomy_elementary_and_last_resort_thursday_night_tv_reviews.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title='Grey's Anatomy', 'Elementary' and 'Last Resort': Thursday night TV reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brad Williams writing for ''What Culture'' praised the show's development over the season saying, &quot;Grey's Anatomy has developed into a fine example of how a TV show can mature beyond its initial purpose.&quot; calling it &quot;something almost anyone can watch and enjoy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/tv/the-muted-genius-of-greys-anatomy.php|title=The Muted Genius of Grey's Anatomy|work=WhatCulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praising the friendship between Cristina and Meredith of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, &quot;There's still one good reason to keep watching: Where else can you find such deep friendships between female co-workers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20651680,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Melissa | last=Maerz | title=Grey's Anatomy | date=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenth season was also marked with praise, Annie Barrett for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote &quot;There's true sorrow here along with the passion, which keeps their dynamic so intriguing to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/greys-anatomy-season-10-premiere/|title=Grey's Anatomy season premiere recap: After the Storm|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caroline Siede from ''[[The A.V.

Bryce Olin of ''[[Netflix]]'' ranked Grey's 9th among the ''50 Best TV Shows on Netflix'' stating, &quot;It’s a tough call, but based on Grey’s casting choices and revolutionary portrayals of female doctors in the series, I’m willing to argue that Grey’s Anatomy is the best medical drama of all time. Obviously, [[Shonda Rhimes]] didn’t reinvent the wheel with the series, but there’s no denying its popularity.&quot; adding, &quot;I understand its significance in the pop culture sphere.&quot; He also stated that the show could go higher in the ranks with the upcoming season stating, &quot;Apparently, Grey’s Anatomy fans are passionate about their show, although it seems like they’ve been closeted for the last few years. I’d love to move Grey’s Anatomy even higher on the ranking, but I’ll have wait until the 11th season comes to Netflix.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://netflixlife.com/tvshows/43/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://netflixlife.com/2015/04/24/50-best-tv-shows-on-netflix-greys-anatomy-moves-up/&lt;/ref&gt;

Grey's has also been credited to have changed the perception on how good and bad television can be defined, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' write, &quot;Since ''[[The Sopranos]]'' burst onto the scene, we’ve too often classified a show as &quot;good&quot; based on how closely it adhered to the dark, violent, male-centric template set out by that particular show. It’s time for that to end. At its best, Grey’s has been among the very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it’s been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even when it seems to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, Grey’s Anatomy is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub.com&quot;/&gt;

In 2011, a woman residing in [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]] became unresponsive due to an [[asthma attack]]. Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) on her, which they learned from ''Grey's Anatomy''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprsave&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/greys-anatomy-cpr-saves-life-269675 | title='Grey's Anatomy' Credited for Saving Life | publisher=Prometheus Global Media | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=December 5, 2011 | accessdate=August 4, 2012 | author=Ford, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: &quot;None of [the characters] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is so far away from the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive.

===U.S. television ratings===
''Grey{{'}}s Anatomy'' has received high viewership and ratings since its debut. The first four seasons of the program each ranked in the top ten among all viewers, reaching its peak [[Nielsen ratings]] in the second season, attracting an average of 19.44 million viewers per episode, and ranking at fifth place overall. Following the show's time-slot being relocated, overall rankings steadily declined, dropping below the top ten in its fifth season. ''Grey's Anatomy'' made its greatest fall from its sixth to seventh season, slipping from seventeenth place to thirty-first. The series is on a steady decline in terms of overall viewership and rankings, yet ''Grey's Anatomy'' still holds value in charts when numbers are pulled from the [[digital video recorder]] (DVR). It was the most recorded show between 2007 and 2011, based on cumulative totals, and has been for several years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.co/ref&gt;m/2011/09/01/top-10-most-tivoed-shows/|title=The most Tivo'ed show on TV is...|accessdate=September 2, 2011|date=September 1, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time, Inc|last=Rice|first=Lynette}}{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
