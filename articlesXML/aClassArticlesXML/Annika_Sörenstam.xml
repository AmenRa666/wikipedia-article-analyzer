'''Annika Sörenstam''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈan.niː.ka ˌsøː.rɛn.ˈstam|pron}}; {{Audio|sv-Annika Sörenstam.ogg|listen}}; born 9 October 1970) is a retired Swedish [[professional golfer]], one of the most successful female golfers in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;LPGA Wins&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Career Wins |publisher=[[LPGA]] (Ladies Professional Golf Association) |url=http://www.lpga.com/content/OfficialWins.pdf |access-date=7 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125181051/http://www.lpga.com/content/OfficialWins.pdf |archivedate=25 January 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before stepping away from competitive golf at the end of the 2008 season, she had won 90 international tournaments as a professional, making her the female golfer with the most wins to her name. She has won 72 official [[LPGA]] tournaments including ten [[women's majors|majors]] and 18 other tournaments internationally, and she tops the LPGA's career money list with earnings of over $22&amp;nbsp;million—over $3&amp;nbsp;million ahead of [[Karrie Webb|her nearest rival]]. Since 2006, Sörenstam has held dual American and Swedish citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizenship&quot;&gt;

The winner of a record eight [[LPGA Tour#LPGA Tour awards|Player of the Year]] awards, and six [[LPGA Tour#LPGA Tour awards|Vare Trophies]] given to the LPGA player with the lowest seasonal scoring average, she is the only female golfer to shoot a 59 in competition. She holds various all-time scoring records including the lowest season scoring average: 68.6969 in 2004.

Representing Europe in the [[Solheim Cup]] on eight occasions between 1994 and 2007, Sörenstam was the event's [[List of European Solheim Cup golfers#Record European point winners|all-time leading points earner]] until her record was surpassed by England's [[Laura Davies]] during the [[2011 Solheim Cup]].

In 2003, Sörenstam made history at the [[Bank of America Colonial]] tournament as the first woman to play in a [[PGA Tour]] event since 1945.

==Childhood and amateur career==
Born in [[Bro, Stockholm|Bro]] near [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Golf Annika's Way&quot;&gt;Annika Sörenstam with the editors of Golf Magazine: ''Golf Annika's Way'', Gotham Books, 2004, ISBN 1-59240-076-0&lt;/ref&gt; Sörenstam's father Tom is a retired [[IBM]] executive and her mother Gunilla worked in a bank. Her younger sister [[Charlotta Sörenstam|Charlotta]] is a professional golfer who coaches at her sister's academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;LottaLPGA&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annika and Charlotta Sörenstam are the only two sisters to have both won $1&amp;nbsp;million on the LPGA.

As a child, Sörenstam was a talented all-round sportsgirl. She was a nationally-ranked junior [[tennis]] player, played [[Association football|football]] (soccer) in her hometown team Bro IK, and was such a good [[Alpine skiing|skier]] that the coach of the Swedish national ski team suggested the family move to northern Sweden to improve her skiing year round.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golf Annika's Way&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claes Lind with Annika Sörenstam, ''Våga bli bäst'' or ''Dare to be the Best'', Sportförlaget i Europa AB, 2003, ISBN 91-88541-56-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Junior golf===
At the age of 12, she switched to golf, sharing her first set of golf clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golf Annika's Way&quot;/&gt; She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt at the end of a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACAD3&quot;&gt;

Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Golf Annika's Way&quot;/&gt;

===Swedish national team===
Her successful amateur career included a win in the St. Rule Trophy played at [[Old Course at St Andrews|St. Andrews]] and a runner-up finish in the Swedish national mother/daughter golf tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;St Rule Trophy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=St Rule Trophy |publisher=St. Andrews Links |date=23 October 2006
