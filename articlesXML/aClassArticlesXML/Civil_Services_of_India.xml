The '''Civil Services''' refer to the [[civil service|civil services]], the permanent [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[Republic of India]]. The civil service system is the backbone of the administrative machinery of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Civil Service System&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arc.gov.in/viet.ppt |title=The civil service system |author=Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances|date=8 June 2011 |work= |publisher=Government of India |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;India National Civil Service&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/unpan006306.pdf |title=National Civil Service System in India : A Critical View|author=[[United Nations Public Administration Network]]|date= |work= |publisher=Government of India |location= |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] of India, the [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] responsibility for running the administration rests with the elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. But the handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants to carry out this policy.

The [[Executive (government)|executive]] decisions are implemented by the Indian civil servants. The members of civil service serve at the pleasure of the [[President of India]] and Article 311 of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] protects them from politically motivated or vindictive action. Civil servants are employees of the [[Government of India]]; however, not all employees of the Government are civil servants. Civil servants in a personal capacity are paid from the [[Civil List]]. Senior civil servants may be called to account by [[Parliament of India|Parliament]].

As of year 2010, there are total 6.4 million government employees in India, and less than 50,000 civil servants to administer them.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darpg.gov.in/darpgwebsite_cms/Document/file/Civil_Services_Survey_2010.pdf|title=The year 2010 Civil Services Report: A Survey|author=[[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (India)|Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances|date=8 June 2010 |work= |publisher=Government of India |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The civil service system in India is rank-based and does not follow the tenets of the position-based civil services.&lt;ref name=&quot;India National Civil Service&quot;/&gt;

In October 2015, the [[Government of India]] approved the formation of &quot;new&quot; Indian Skill Development Service-Group A.&lt;ref name=&quot;Group A creation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Government nod to raise new Group-A civil service cadre|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/XO89PxfcsCgWQ31vyFi6cJ/Government-nod-to-raise-new-GroupA-civil-service-cadre.html|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ISDS-India&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Govt approves formation of Indian Skill Development Service|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/govt-approves-formation-of-indian-skill-development-service/articleshow/49261963.cms|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lord [[Warren Hastings]] laid the foundations of civil service and [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] reformed, modernised and rationalised it. Hence, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] is known as the 'Father of Civil Service in India'. He introduced Covenanted Civil Services (higher civil services) and Uncovenanted Civil Services (lower civil services).

The present civil services of India is mainly based on the pattern of the former [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] of [[British India]]. The civil services were divided into two categories - covenanted and uncovenanted. The covenanted civil service consisted of only Europeans (i.e., English personnel) occupying the higher posts in the government. The uncovenanted civil service was solely introduced to facilitate the entry of Indians at the lower rung of the administration.&lt;ref&gt;Meghna Sabharwal, Evan M. Berman  &quot;Public Administration in South Asia: India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan (Public Administration and Public Policy,&quot; (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CUC Civil Service&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpregion/asia/india/indiaofficerecordsfamilyhistory/occupations/civilservice/civilservice.html |title=Civil Service |author=|date=8 June 2011 |work= |publisher=The British Library|location= |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passing of the [[Government of India Act 1919]], the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Imperial Services]] headed by the [[Secretary of State for India]], were split into two â€“ [[All India Services]] and [[Central Civil Services of India|Central Services]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Personnel Administration&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title =Public Personnel Administration : Theory and Practice||last=Goel |first=S.L. | publisher=Deep and Deep Publications, 2008| isbn = 9788176293952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[All India Services|All India]]  and class 1 [[Central Civil Services of India|Central Services]] were designated as Central Superior Services as early as  1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;Problems and Issues Administration&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title =Problems and Issues in Administrative Federalism||last=Maheshwari |first=Shriram | publisher=Allied Publishers| isbn = 9788170233428}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1924 to 1934, Administration in India consisted of &quot;nine&lt;ref name=&quot;Problems and Issues Administration&quot;/&gt; to seven&quot; All India Services and five central departments, all under the control of Secretary of State for India, and 3 central departments under joint Provincial and Imperial Control.

===Present day===
The present modern civil service was formed after the [[partition of India]] in 1947. It was [[Sardar Patel]]'s vision that the Civil Service should strengthen cohesion and national unity. The values of integrity, impartiality and merit remain the guiding principles of Indian civil services.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Since the early 20th century, Indian civil servants have been  colloquially called &quot;[[Babu (title)|babus]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Yet to start work, Natgrid CEO highest paid babu| url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Yet-to-start-work-Natgrid-CEO-highest-paid-babu/articleshow/15610191.cms?referral=PM |date=Aug 23, 2012| accessdate = 2014-09-17 | publisher = The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Indian bureaucracy is called &quot;babudom&quot;, as in the &quot;rule of babus&quot;, especially in Indian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1818/18181170.htm

==Constitution==
The [[Constitution of India|constitution]] under Article 312&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of India, Article 312|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/647227/}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides for All India Civil Services branches to be set up by giving the power to the [[Rajya Sabha]] (upper house of the Parliament of India) to resolve by a two-thirds majority to establish new all-India services. The [[Indian Administrative Service]], [[Indian Police Service]] and  [[Indian Forest Service]] are set up under this constitutional provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Government website|url=http://www.archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/profile.php?id=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2011, the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) of the [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (India)|Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]] created a proposal to retire and remove incompetent, inefficient and unproductive [[All India Service]] officers after 15 years of service, instead of tolerating them until their retirement. Former [[Cabinet Secretary (India)|Cabinet Secretary]] [[TSR Subramanian]] welcomed this move with caution, saying, &quot;Periodical weeding out is very good. But the process to determine who needs to be prematurely retired should be fair and transparent. There is a possibility that even good officers may be targeted because of political reasons,&quot;. Former [[Union Public Service Commission|UPSC]] chairman PC Hota echoed his sentiments remarking that, &quot;We need drastic remedies. The situation has become terrible. The other day an officer in Delhi was arrested for disproportionate assets of Rs.31.5&amp;nbsp;million. She is just a 2000-batch [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer with 11 years of service.

In October 2013, the [[Supreme Court of India]], in the case of ''[[TSR Subramanian|TSR Subramanian &amp; Ors vs Union of India &amp; Ors]]'' &lt;ref name=&quot;WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO(s). 82 OF 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO(s). 82 OF 2011|url=http://courtnic.nic.in/supremecourt/temp/wc%208211p.txt|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered both [[Government of India]] and [[State governments of India|State governments]] to ensure fixed tenure to civil servants. The court asked senior bureaucrats to write down the oral instructions from politicians so that a record would be kept of all the decisions. This judgement was seen on the similar lines of the Supreme Court's 2006 judgement in [[Prakash Singh case]] on [[Indian police reforms|police reforms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prakash Singh Case&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Prakash Singh Case|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1090328/|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SC asks states to file affidavit on police reforms&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=SC asks states to file affidavit on police reforms|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/SC-asks-states-to-file-affidavit-on-police-reforms/Article1-945679.aspx|accessdate=16 October 2012|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement was welcomed by various bureaucrats and [[Media of India|the media]] who hoped that it will help in giving freedom and independence to the functioning of bureaucracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSR Subramanian case&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court favours law to regulate transfer, posting of IAS officers|url=http://www.niticentral.com/2013/10/31/sc-favours-law-to-regulate-transfer-posting-of-ias-officers-152923.html|accessdate=31 October 2013|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;T S R Subramanian case&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=SC to bureaucrats: Don't take oral instructions from netas|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-to-bureaucrats-Dont-take-oral-instructions-from-netas/articleshow/24978551.cms|accessdate=31 October 2013|date=31 October 2013|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To recruit better candidates for the various services, UPSC brought about changes in the Prelims stage of the Civil Services Examination in 2011 by abolishing the optional subject paper and introducing the Civil Services Aptitude Test (CSAT). Further changes were made in the Mains stage of the exam from 2013 onwards. Despite recent revisions, the contents of the exam are still same and the quality of the candidates is dropping day by day. It requires lot of cramming power to succeed in this exam. Since, only people with no opportunities in private sector, get the time and the patience to prepare for 2-3 years for civil services, the quality of the candidates have really become very low, as the better candidates go for MBA or offshore assignments in IT companies to US.

In 2016, the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]] for the first time, dismissed 72 and prematurely retired another 33 [[Indian Revenue Service]] officers for non-performance and on disciplinary grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finance Ministry 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/for-good-governance-finance-ministry-fires-72-tax-officers-retires-33-more-116050600022_1.html|title=For good governance, Finance Ministry fires 72 tax officers, retires 33 more|accessdate=12 May 2016|publisher=[[Business Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PIB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=144910|title=Government takes strict action against defaulting/non performing tax officials/officers|accessdate=12 May 2016|publisher=[[Press Information Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the government has removed group A civil servants in the past also, this is the first time, when the members of this power lobby of &quot;Group A Civil Servants&quot; have been removed in such a large number
