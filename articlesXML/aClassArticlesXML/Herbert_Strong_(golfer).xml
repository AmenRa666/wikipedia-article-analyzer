'''Herbert Bertram Strong''' (13 February 1880 – 8 October 1944) was an English [[professional golfer]]. He was an organizer and founding member of the [[PGA of America]] and later became a successful [[golf course architect]]. As a player, Strong's best finish in a [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]] was ninth place in the [[1913 U.S. Open (golf)|1913 U.S. Open]].

==Early life==
Strong was born on 13 February 1880 in [[Ramsgate]], Kent, England, to William R. Strong (1846–1899) and Charlotte E. Strong née Stock (1850–1923). Like many golfers from his era, he was first introduced to golf via his participation as a [[caddy]] when he toted bags at [[Royal St George's Golf Club]] located in [[Sandwich, England]], in the mid-1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Championship Competition&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Championship Competition |work=Aberdeen Journal |date=20 September 1913 |accessdate=24 February 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000576/19130920/050/0005 |via = [[British Newspaper Archive]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he emigrated to the United States, departing [[Liverpool]] on 14 June 1905 aboard the [[SS Teutonic|SS ''Teutonic'']] which arrived in New York on 22 June 1905 with $400 in his pocket, a hefty sum at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrival in New York-1905&quot;&gt;[[:File:SS Teutonic passenger manifest June 14, 1905.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First PGA of America Secretary-Treasurer==

[[Rodman Wanamaker]], the wealthy proprietor of the Wanamaker department stores (now [[Macy's]]), and a number of golf professionals—including the legendary [[Walter Hagen]] and leading amateurs of the era—gathered at Wanamaker's invitation for a luncheon at the Taplow Club in the Martinique Hotel on Broadway and West 32nd Street in New York City on 17 January 1916.  Wanamaker believed golf professionals could enhance equipment sales if they formed an association.&lt;ref name=&quot;pga.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pga.com/pga-america/pga-feature/pga-america-history-1916-1919 |title=PGA of America History – 1916–1919 |publisher=PGA of America |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this meeting that Strong, [[James Hepburn (golfer)|James Hepburn]], [[Jack Hobens]], Jack Mackie, [[James Maiden]], [[Gilbert Nicholls]] and [[Robert W. White (golfer)|Robert White]] were chosen as the organizing committee of the [[PGA of America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Golfdom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/tic/golfd/article/1959aug30.pdf|author=Golfdom|date=August 30, 1959|page=30|title=Robert White, Pro Pioneer, Dies in Myrtle Beach, S.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1916, Strong was appointed as the first Secretary-Treasurer.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/tic/golfd/article/1944oct3.pdf |title=Making The Swing |magazine=Golfdom |first=Herb |last=Graffis |authorlink=Herb Graffis |date=October 1944 |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Herbert Strong-circa 1909.JPG|thumb|left|225px|Strong in position to hit a shot with his driver, {{circa|1909}}]]
The Taplow Club gathering initiated a series of several meetings over the next several months and, on 10 April 1916, the PGA of America was officially established with 35 charter members. Wanamaker proposed that the newly formed organization hold an annual tournament, and offered to donate money for a trophy and prize fund. That October, the first annual [[PGA Championship]] took place at the [[Siwanoy Country Club]] in Bronxville, New York. [[James Barnes (golfer)|James M. Barnes]] defeated [[Jock Hutchison]] in the championship match, taking home the [[Wanamaker Trophy]] and $2,580 as his share of the purse.&lt;ref name=&quot;pga.com&quot;/&gt;

==Early career==
Strong competed in the [[1899 Open Championship]] at Royal St George's Golf Club located in Sandwich, England. He played as an amateur, scored 89 and 90 and missed the cut by 8 strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=8 June 1899 |page=9 |title=Golf – The Open Championship – the first 36 holes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1902 he had become the professional at the [[Gog Magog Golf Club]] near Cambridge.&lt;ref name=Sandwich /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=12 November 1902 |page=12 |title=Golf – J. Sherlock v H. Strong}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a friendly match against [[Tom Vardon]] at Sandwich on 27 May 1903, Strong made a hole-in-one (likely wind assisted) on a par 4 hole.&lt;ref name=Sandwich&gt;{{cite web|title=Tee Shots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1k2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=H.+Strong+Sandwich&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fODHAazz4z&amp;sig=m6qdeR6dZvWZ63dZLFOC4km3sQU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwDmoVChMIw_KpoazkxgIVSDaICh1Sngdi#v=onepage&amp;q=H.%20Strong%20Sandwich&amp;f=false|website=books.Google.com|publisher=''Golf Illustrated''|page=170|date=29 May 1903|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[1903 Open Championship]] held at [[Prestwick Golf Club]], South Ayrshire, Scotland, but failed to advance past the half-way cut. In the [[1904 Open Championship]], again held on his home course at Sandwich, Strong opened with a first round 93—in [[wind]]y and cold conditions—but could only improve to 88 in round two when the weather improved. He ended up missing the cut, by 13 strokes, which came at 168.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenner&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Majors of Golf: Complete Results of the Open, the U.S. Open, the PGA Championship and the Masters, 1860-2008 |volume=1 |first=Morgan G. |last=Brenner |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, he emigrated to the United States and became the professional at [[The Apawamis Club]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1910-07-26/ed-1/seq-4/ |title=Practice for Tourney |newspaper=New York Tribune |date=26 July 1910 |page=4 |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Rye, New York, a course featuring pronounced land forms and blind shots. When you combine this with his time spent at Royal St George's, the course nearest his home where he learned to play golf, you start to see a lot of his architectural influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ianandrew&quot;/&gt; In 1911, he moved to [[Inwood Country Club]] and remodeled the course over several years eventually leading to the course hosting the [[1921 PGA Championship]] and the [[1923 U.S. Open (golf)|1923 U.S. Open]]. On 16 September 1905 Strong partnered with 18-year-old [[Jerome Travers]] to tie for second place, shooting 72, in a [[Four-ball golf|four-ball]] tournament—part of the [[Metropolitan Open|1905 Metropolitan Open]]—that was held at Fox Hills Golf Club on [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox Hills&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Ball Match|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1905-09-17/ed-1/seq-11/#date1=1905&amp;index=0&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Fox+Golf+Hills&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1905&amp;proxtext=Fox+Hills+Golf&amp;y=12&amp;x=9&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|accessdate=24 August 2015|newspaper=New York Tribune|date=17 September 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineers Country Club===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:HerbertStrongEngineersCC.JPG|thumb|right|370px|Engineers Country Club, Roslyn Harbor, New York]] --&gt;
[[Engineers Country Club]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ianandrew&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ianandrewsgolfdesignblog.blogspot.com/ |title=Ian Andrew's Golf Design Blog |first=Ian |last=Andrew |work=ianandrewsgolfdesignblog.blogspot.com |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1917 by a group of engineers from Manhattan.  The club features a bold course with titanic undulating green complexes and wide hole corridors built on terrain that at times slashes upward or cascades sharply downward to greens protected by dramatic [[Bunker (golf)|bunkers]].  Within those features are subtle touches that only those familiar with the course recognize: the well-placed roll in the fairway or the slight green contouring that sends putts in directions that seemingly defy the law of gravity.

Strong was able to complete construction of the golf course in only 27 months time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegolfballfactory.com/the-golf-course/hole5/herbert-strong-golf-architect-ad.JPG A Course Record]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Devereux Emmet]] remodeled part of the course in 1921. The course hosted the [[1919 PGA Championship]] and the 1920 [[U.S. Amateur]]. A sports writer of the time wrote in August 1920: &quot;No young club in the history of golf, let it go back 400 years, has come in for as much discussion and comment as Engineers. The main nerve test will be on the greens. You will find strong men weeping as they finish a round&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineerscc.com/History.aspx |title=History: The Legend of Engineers Country Club |publisher=Engineers Country Club |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career – golf course architecture==
Strong's architectural work was to be commended as praise worthy for its originality.&lt;ref name=&quot;GC Atlas&quot; /&gt; He excelled in making his golf courses stand out with interesting features such as multi-tiered greens and deep, cavernous bunkers. Strong managed to advance his art form to a higher level not always approached by other architects.&lt;ref name=&quot;GC Atlas&quot;&gt;http://golfclubatlas.com/courses-by-country/usa/canterbury/ golfclubatlas.com&lt;/ref&gt; Asked to articulate his philosophy of golf course design, Strong said, &quot;the duty of the golf architect is to build natural beauty into every possible feature of play.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2000-06-26/news/3301912_1_bethlehem-steel-golf-saucon-valley-country-club |title=Course Was Solution To Tee-time Troubles Former Bethlehem Steel President Eugene Grace Founded Saucon Valley Country Club To Satisfy His Urge To Go For The Green. U.S. Senior Open |newspaper=The Morning Call |first=Frank |last=Whelan |date=26 June 2000 |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in the need for good shot-making and felt that a player should pay a high price for a poorly executed shot—occasionally with very dire results.  His greens were what set him apart and often set more of the strategy than the equally daunting bunkers.  He designed boldly contoured greens that required careful approach, from the ideal side of the fairway, to avoid running through the green and into trouble beyond.  Strong is credited with designing the first island green in the United States.  Strong designed this oft-copied challenge—the dreaded 9th hole—in 1928 on the Ocean Course at [[Ponte Vedra Inn and Club]].  The course was scheduled to host the 1939 [[Ryder Cup]] matches if [[World War II]] had not intervened.  The island itself, lying 157 yards from the tee, is edged by palm trees and peppered with bunkers; the hole seldom plays easy due to stiff ocean breezes. The Ocean Course was redesigned by [[Robert Trent Jones|Robert Trent Jones Sr.]] in 1947, then again by [[Bobby Weed]] in 1998. The 1947 redesign by Jones was an attempt to reduce some of the severity of Strong's design features.&lt;ref name=&quot;Florida Historic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://floridahistoricgolftrail.com/media/1127/fhgt-infosheet.pdf |title=Ponte Vedra Inn and Club [Ocean Course] |website=FloridaHistoricGolfTrail |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote box |salign=right|bgcolor=lightgray| quote =&lt;big&gt;&quot;Build natural beauty into every possible feature of play&quot;.&lt;/big&gt;|source=—Strong on his architectural philosophy|align=left| width=225px}}

At Engineers Country Club, Strong's routing approached the hills from every conceivable angle making a full and varied use of the available topography.  He designed holes that played straight up the hill, had holes traversing along the crests with second shots to green sites placed below, and even from one hill to the next.  He brought you in at an angle and off the top of hills and slopes depending on what topography he could take advantage of.  His course design skills were even more impressive at Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19700610&amp;id=04syAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IbkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3652,2573513 |newspaper=The Montreal Gazette |title=God Bless you, Herbert Strong |date=10 June 1970 |page=39 |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he managed to build a great course on a very severe piece of topography with 400 feet of elevation change. The newspaper columnist and [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] biographer O. B. Keeler wrote, &quot;so excellent an authority as [[Walter Travis]], the grand old man of American golf, was heard to state rather freely that several of the holes [at Engineers Country Club] were too severe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Links Golf Mag&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linksmagazine.com/golf_courses/engineer-s-country-club-7-26-12 |last=Pioppi|first=Anthony|title=Engineers Country Club |website=LinksMagazine.com |date=January 2008|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
If there is any criticism of Strong's golf course architecture it would likely be due to the severity of his design of greens and their ability to repel poor shots, and even good shots if they hit the green at the wrong speed or angle. His green designs often incorporated two tiers and sometimes featured a crowned central area, in the manner of fellow golf course architect [[Donald Ross (golfer)|Donald Ross]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinehurst.com/golf/courses/no-2/ |title=No. 2 – Pinehurst Resort |work=Pinehurst Resort |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that rewarded only the finest of shots; poor shots would drift off the back and to the sides of greens, and greens incorporating false fronts would agonize players whose shots were short and not reaching the central plateau of the green.  Most players of his era—playing with wood-shafted clubs—struggled with the boldness, originality and aggressiveness of the architectural forms that he used.  The original Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu course in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], is full of fascinating holes that traverse an extremely hilly and severe property.&lt;ref name=&quot;ianandrew&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu -3.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu golf course&lt;br /&gt;
(Charlevoix, Quebec, Canada)]]
 
Strong possessed the ability to find good holes on land that seemed far too severe for golf and had the gumption to build very bold and distinctive holes that are open to criticism but clearly are more thought provoking and interesting than most other architect's work. The green slopes that he envisioned and built on his courses were the single best defense of a hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;ianandrew&quot;/&gt;

==1913 U.S. Open==
The [[1913 U.S. Open (golf)|1913 U.S. Open]] was the 19th U.S. Open, held 18–20 September, at [[The Country Club]] in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb southwest of Boston.  Amateur [[Francis Ouimet]], age 20, won his only U.S. Open title in an 18-hole playoff, five strokes ahead of British stars [[Harry Vardon]] and [[Ted Ray (golfer)|Ted Ray]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenner&quot; /&gt;

Strong was in contention to win after two rounds of play and was referred to in the ''[[Aberdeen Journal]]'' as &quot;the sometime Sandwich caddie&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Championship Competition&quot;/&gt; An article in the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'', published on 19 September 1913, referred to Strong as &quot;a dark horse of the first magnitude&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Strong Plays Alone&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3A1913_US_Open_-_Herbert_Strong_plays_alone_..._yes_he_did.jpg |title=Vardon and Reid Lead Golfers on First Day of Championship Play |newspaper=The Indianapolis Star |date=19 September 1913 |page=6 |accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he scored surprisingly well in rounds one and two, playing alone and without a partner. Only a scoring official accompanied him on the course. Strong's game was enhanced by his masterful ability to hit the short approach shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apawamis Pro&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Herbert_Strong-Apawamis_Club_1909.pdf |title=Some of the Master Strokes in Golf Described |newspaper=New York Daily Tribune |date=25 April 1909 |page=5 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His weakness, at times, was erratic putting.&lt;ref name=&quot;1913 U.S. Open-Strong's Putting&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1913-09-19/ed-1/seq-10/#date1=1905&amp;index=12&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Herbert+Strong&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1922&amp;proxtext=Herbert+Strong&amp;y=12&amp;x=8&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 |title=Herbert Strong in the Same Notch–Francis Ouimet, an Amateur, Plays Brilliant Golf–Champion Still Has Hope |newspaper=New York Tribune |date=19 September 1913 |page=10 |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ray Two Strokes Away&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Ray Two Strokes Away|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1913-09-19/ed-1/seq-10/#date1=1913&amp;index=5&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Ray+Ted&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1913&amp;proxtext=Ted+Ray&amp;y=7&amp;x=19&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1|accessdate=7 July 2015|newspaper=New York Tribune|page=10|date=19 September 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his small physique—he weighed only 120 pounds—he was described as a long hitter of the ball and he insisted that his size was not a handicap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1908_US_Open-Myopia_Hunt_Club.pdf |title=Seek Open Golf Title – Look Toward Myopia |newspaper=New York Daily Tribune |date=10 August 1908 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two rounds were played Thursday and the final two rounds on Friday. Strong's fine results in the first two rounds put him on 149, tied for second place with Ray, two strokes behind the second round leader, Vardon, who stood at 147. Strong's play was remarkable for its steadiness, rather than any particular brilliancy, as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strong Plays Alone&quot;/&gt; Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1, 2 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegolfballfactory.com/Hall-of-Champions/2nd-day-scoreboard-for-the-us-open-1913.htm |title=2nd day Scoreboard US Open Golf Tournament 1913 |work=thegolfballfactory.com |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A disappointing third round 82, however, ruined any chance he had to win the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310, +18 to par, for a ninth-place finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://golfmajorchampionships.com/players?player=839 |title=Herbert Strong |publisher=Golf Major Championships |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won $40 as his share of the purse.

==Family==

Strong fathered five children, three with his first wife Clara Maude Overy (1881–1954):
:Irene Maude Strong (1900–1992)
:Herbert Strong (1902–1930)
:Enid Vera Strong (1905–1914)

After enduring a divorce—and the early death of two of his children—he remarried in 1942 to Ann Carolyn Jordan (1922–2004), a woman 42 years his junior. His first wife, Clara, returned with her only surviving child to live in England. His second marriage to Ann Jordan yielded one son and a daughter:
:Herbert &quot;Sonny&quot; Strong (1942–2015)
:Molly Strong (1943–2006)

==Death and legacy==

Strong died at age 64 of a heart attack in [[Fort Pierce, Florida]], on 8 October 1944.&lt;ref name=death/&gt; He is best remembered as a prolific golf course architect in the early 20th century. Strong apparently never applied for American citizenship; the [[1940 census|1940 U.S. census]] listed him as a [[resident alien]] as of that date.
