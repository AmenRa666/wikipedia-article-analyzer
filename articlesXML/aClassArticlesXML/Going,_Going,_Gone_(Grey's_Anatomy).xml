&quot;'''Going, Going, Gone'''&quot; is the first episode of the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 9)|ninth season]] of the American television [[medical drama]] ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and the show's 173rd&amp;nbsp;episode overall. Written by Stacy McKee and directed by [[Rob Corn]], the episode was originally broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) in the United States on September&amp;nbsp;27, 2012. The initial airing was viewed by 11.73&amp;nbsp;million people and garnered a 4.4&amp;nbsp;[[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|Nielsen rating]] in the 18–49&amp;nbsp;demographic, registering the show as the week's highest rated television drama.

''Grey's Anatomy'' centers around a group of physicians struggling to balance their professional lives with their personal lives. In this episode, the doctors of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital cope with the physical and emotional reverberations of the aviation accident that took place in the [[Flight (Grey's Anatomy)|season eight finale]], while several [[Residency (medicine)|surgical residents]] are promoted. Further storylines include [[Dr. Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]) relocating to a different hospital, and a group of new [[Internship (medicine)|interns]] being intimidated by [[Dr. Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]).

The episode saw the death of [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Dr. Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]); the actor was let go due to budget cuts by the producers. Excessive spoilers were not released, in order to keep the fates of select characters unknown. However, multiple cast members leaked pictures from the set. [[Jason George]] returned in guest capacity, along with newcomers [[William Daniels]], [[Steven Culp]], [[Philip Casnoff]], [[Gaius Charles]], [[Camilla Luddington]], [[Tina Majorino]], and [[Jerrika Hinton]]. Critics generally regarded &quot;Going, Going, Gone&quot; as disconsolate.

==Plot==
In the [[Flight (Grey's Anatomy)|season eight finale]], [[Dr. Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Dr. Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), [[Dr. Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Dr. Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]), [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Dr. Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), and [[Arizona Robbins|Dr. Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]) are caught in an aviation accident, leaving Lexie Grey dead, and the rest of the doctors stranded. &quot;Going, Going, Gone&quot; picks up about one month after the crash, and throughout the episode, features home videos of Sloan. The episode begins with Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's new [[Internship (medicine)|interns]], Dr. Shane Ross ([[Gaius Charles]]), Dr. Jo Wilson ([[Camilla Luddington]]), Dr. Heather Brookes ([[Tina Majorino]]), and Dr. Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton), expressing fear of Meredith Grey, who is now an [[Attending physician|attending]] [[general surgery|general surgeon]]. It is revealed that former [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] [[Dr. Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) will be pursuing a [[pediatric surgery|pediatric surgical]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. The scene switches to [[Minnesota]], where Yang is now a [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] fellow.

Back in [[Seattle]], Dr. Ben Warren ([[Jason George]]) surprises his fiancée [[Dr. Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]) with a visit. The couple reunites with constant sexual activity, for which the interns tease Bailey. Meanwhile, [[Dr. Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]) allows Shepherd to operate on a [[spinal cord]], despite his hand being broken from the plane crash. Thereafter, it is revealed that Sloan is in a comatose state, and will be taken off of life support that evening. In the hospital cafeteria, Meredith Grey announces that Wilson will be given the honor of performing a supervised [[appendectomy]], a procedure historically used as a reward for interns. The hospital's chief of surgery, [[Dr. Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), introduces the new pediatric surgery attending, Dr. Mel Barnett ([[Philip Casnoff]]), to Torres and Karev. Barnett informs Karev that he will not be continuing with the African orphan charity program (a function to treat ill children from [[Third World]] countries), something that was initially finalized by the latter and former chief of pediatric surgery, Robbins. Karev becomes upset about this, and asks Torres to prevent Barnett from discontinuing the program, though Torres shows no interest in helping Karev.

During Shepherd's surgery, his hand becomes numb, and he frustratedly exits the operating room. In the intern appendectomy, Wilson makes a mistake and freezes, leading to a scolding from Meredith Grey. Back in Minnesota, Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her superiors at [[Mayo Clinic]], Dr. Craig Thomas ([[William Daniels]]) and Dr. Parker ([[Steven Culp]]), so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan's death. However, her [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder|PTSD]] hinders her from boarding the plane, and she ultimately remains in Minnesota. Meanwhile, [[Jackson Avery|Dr. Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]]), now a [[plastic surgery|plastic surgical]] fellow, sits by Sloan's bedside and talks of medical cases to him. [[Dr. Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) enters Sloan's hospital room and removes him from life support. Unable to cope with Sloan's death, Meredith Grey boards a plane to visit Yang, but panics before it takes off. Shortly thereafter, Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar, where he reveals that he will be staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. The next morning, Hunt visits [[April Kepner|Dr. April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]) at her family's farm, and asks her to begin working in Seattle again. At the conclusion of the episode, Torres returns home to Robbins, who is revealed to have had her lower left leg amputated as a result of the crash.

{{Quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=&quot;The videos so well helped to illustrate what a great guy Sloan ultimately was, because it seems that people mostly just remember all his skirt-chasing and general pig-headedness.
