'''Leonard Orban''' (born 28 June 1961) is a [[Romanians|Romanian]] independent [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]] who served as the [[European Commissioner for Multilingualism|Commissioner for Multilingualism]] in the [[Barroso commission|European Commission]], the executive body of the [[European Union]] (EU). He was responsible for the [[Languages of the European Union|EU language policy]] and was the first [[List of EU Commissioners by Nationality#Romanian Commissioners|Romanian Commissioner]] and the first [[European Commissioner|member of the Commission]] whose [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]] is exclusively [[multilingualism]]. His term of office began on 1 January 2007 and ended on 9 February 2010. With a background in [[engineering]] and [[economics]], Orban has taken up various posts working for the [[accession of Romania to the European Union]], most prominently as Deputy and later as Chief Negotiator for his country at the time of final negotiations with the European Union.

Steering the multilingualism [[language policy]] of the EU, Orban focused on promoting [[language learning|foreign language learning]] through EU programmes such as the [[EU Integrated programme|Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. In addition, his remit also included the effective functioning of the EU's extensive [[Directorate-General for Interpretation (European Commission)|interpretation]], [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|translation]] and [[Publications Office (European Union)|publication services]] in the [[Languages of the European Union#Official languages of the European Union|23 official languages]]. To support the remit of his portfolio, Orban oversaw a staff of 3,400 in total (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the [[EU budget]].

Though unaffiliated to any political party, Orban adheres to [[liberalism]]. He supports Romania's closer [[European integration]] and a strong European Union, and were in favour of the relaunch of the frozen [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] without modifications to the original text.

As of 20 September 2011, he is the Romanian Minister of European Affairs, a new ministry in the [[Emil Boc]] Cabinet.

==Early years and personal life==

From 1993 to 2001, Orban served as a Parliamentary Counsellor on European and International Affairs within the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], where he was responsible for the European Integration Committee, as well as relations with the European Parliament.

After the signing of the Treaty, when Romania received the status of the observer in the [[Council of the European Union]] and in the Commission's committees, Orban was responsible for coordinating Romania's policies and positions in EU affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CV&quot;/&gt; On 30 October 2006, Orban was nominated as Romania's candidate for the European Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomination&quot;&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1499&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en President Barroso presents the Commissioner designate for Romania], ''European Commission Press Release'', October 30, 2006.

Orban has not joined a political party, but is of [[liberalism|liberal]] political leaning. He participated as an independent in the [[European Parliament political group]] [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hotnews.ro/%27%27It%27s-professionalism-that-matters-for-an-European-Commissioner-not-the-country-of-origin-articol_43967.htm 'It's professionalism that matters for an European Commissioner, not the country of origin&quot;], ''HotNews.ro'', December 12, 2006.

==Portfolio as European Commissioner==
As [[European Commissioner for Multilingualism]] in the Barroso Commission, Orban was responsible for the [[languages of the European Union|language policy of the European Union]], i.e. promoting [[multilingualism]] for the citizens and the institutions of the [[European Union]]. He was the first to hold this [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]]. Multilingualism has previously and subsequently been a responsibility of the [[European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism]], [[Ján Figeľ]], the first Commissioner whose portfolio explicitly included multilingualism.

Politically, the portfolio is focused on promoting [[language learning|foreign languages learning]],&lt;ref name=Communication&gt;''[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0596:EN:NOT Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the Regions – A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism]'' COM(2005) 596 final, November 22, 2005.

Retrieved on February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as means for the [[labour mobility|worker’s mobility]] and business [[competitiveness]].

Though awareness for [[linguistic diversity]] is a policy target, the [[language rights]] of speakers of [[Regional language|regional]], [[Minority language|minority]], lesser-used and migrant languages are not legally protected. In the European Union, [[language policy]] is the responsibility of member states and European Union does not have a &quot;common language policy.&quot; Based on the &quot;principle of [[subsidiarity]]&quot;, European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in their language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html#anArt150 Consolidated version of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Articles 149 to 150], ''Official Journal C 321E of 29 December 2006''. Retrieved on February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states and the European Union has very limited influence in this area. However, a number of European Union funded programmes actively promote [[language learning]], most prominently under the much wider [[EU Integrated programme|Lifelong learning Programme 2007–2013]]. Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes, protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the member states.

Orban was also responsible for the effective functioning of the European Union's extensive [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], [[translation]] and [[publication]] services in the 23 official languages of the Union. Language policy affects the overall European Union strategy of communication with its citizens and the effort to establish a European identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;&gt;Leonard Orban, [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/commission/2006_enlarg/speeches/speech_orban_en.pdf Introductory statement – European Parliament Hearing], (PDF) ''European Parliament website'', November 27, 2006. Retrieved on January 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In many of these issues, responsibility was shared with other Commissioners, namely the European Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture, Ján Figeľ. Orban was also responsible, alongside the [[President of the European Commission|President of the Commission]], [[José Manuel Barroso|Barroso]], and Figeľ to work on &quot;intercultural dialogue&quot;, including the 2008 [[European Year of Intercultural Dialogue]].

Administratively, Orban was in charge of the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General (DG) for Translation]], the [[Directorate-General for Interpretation (European Commission)|DG for Interpretation]] and the [[Publications Office (European Union)|Office for Official Publications of the European Communities]], as well as the Multilingualism policy unit (EAC-C-5) in the [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture (European Commission)|DG for Education and Culture]]. In total, Orban is responsible for overseeing 3,400 staff (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the [[EU budget]].&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt;

Orban was assisted by a cabinet of nine members; Patricia Bugnot (French) was Head of Cabinet and Jochen Richter (German) was Deputy Head. The cabinet did not include any natively [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/archives/commission_2004-2009/orban/team/team_en.htm Leonard Orban – Official site – My Team], ''European Commission website'', undated.

According to Article 45 of the protocol to the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania, the new members of the Commission representing the acceding member states were appointed by the Council of the European Union in common accord with the President of the Commission and after consultation with the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2005/l_157/l_15720050621en00290045.pdf Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania], (PDF) ''Official Journal L 157 of 21 June 2005''. Retrieved on January 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[Enlargement of the European Union|former enlargements of the European Union]], the Accession Treaty for Bulgaria and Romania, for the first time, contains an explicit acknowledgement of the Parliament’s role and constitutes the formal legal basis for the new Commissioners’ appointment procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/commission/2006_enlarg/procedure_en.htm Hearings of the two Commissioners designate from Bulgaria and Romania: The appointment procedure and key dates], ''European Parliament website'', undated. Retrieved on April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2006, in agreement with the President of the Commission, Barroso, the Romanian government nominated Leonard Orban as Commissioner designate for Romania. Barroso assigned him the portfolio of multilingualism. Before Orban, [[Varujan Vosganian]], a former Romanian [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] [[Ministry of Economy and Commerce of Romania|Minister of Economy and Commerce]], had been nominated, but withdrew his candidature due to allegations concerning his past involvement with the secret police under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]] and party financing by a tycoon. National Liberal Party foreign minister [[Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu]] refused a nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomination&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/romania-proposes-new-commissioner-candidate/article-159271 Romania proposes new commissioner candidate], ''EurActiv.com'', October 30, 2006. Retrieved on January 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The assignment of the multilingualism portfolio to the Romanian Commissioner by Barroso was highly controversial. Barroso was severely criticized for creating a new Commissioner portfolio so that the accessing countries in 2007 could hold a post. The portfolio was criticized for being too &quot;light&quot; for such a high-rank official, that there would be an overlap of responsibilities with other Commissioners and the good functioning of the Commission would be endangered. The portfolio was considered insubstantial for a Commissioner due to the limited jurisdiction of the EU in affecting language policy and the more administrative (rather than political character) of the post. In addition, it appeared that the portfolio had been created to complete a 27-strong Commission; Romania's appointment of a technocrat rather than a politician, given the country's deficits in interior and justice policies, especially in terms of corruption, would result in the Romanian Commissioner taking a degraded portfolio. This criticism came from the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), Romania's main opposition party,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=world_news&amp;month=november2006&amp;file=world_news2006110224558.xml Romanian oppn wants better EU portfolio], ''The Peninsula'' (Reuters), November 2, 2006.

In his hearing at the European Parliament, Leonard Orban focused on defending the importance of his post in presenting the EU language policy, emphasising [[language learning|foreign language learning]] and describing the concrete initiatives he intended to implement.&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;summary of hearing&quot;&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-329-331-11-48-901-20061127IPR00312-27-11-2006-2006-false/default_en.htm Summary of hearing of Leonard Orban, Commissioner-designate for Multilingualism], ''European Parliament Press Release'', November 27, 2006.

Retrieved on February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orban said that he intended to spearhead the Commission's work on a portfolio that has become more important with every [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] and assured the [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] that his portfolio was a substantial one, covering a range of important political and managerial responsibilities. He also described how his portforlio would contribute to economic [[competitiveness]], the social dimension of the EU and the intercultural dialogue and stated that it would provide a forum for European political dialogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt;

Orban told the Committee that the multilingual dimension of the EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes and should not be seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, &quot;Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the [[internal market]]: [[Cultural policies of the European Union|culture]], [[Education in the European Union|education]] and competitiveness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, &quot;At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [... but] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; According to Orban, multilingualism promotes [[labour mobility]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and a sense of [[European citizenship]] and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; Within the [[Lisbon Strategy|Lisbon strategy]], the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient.&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; To address this, Orban aims to improve [[language teaching]] and to make the media and new [[Information technology|communication technologies]] more language-friendly. He underlined that, &quot;our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and Russian.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; He added that, &quot;The promotion of language learning and [[linguistic diversity]] is a general objective of the new [[EU Integrated programme|programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007]]. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union as well as to the languages of the EU's main trading partners.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against [[discrimination]] on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, &quot;Europe's linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted,&quot; which presumably includes all languages, [[national language|national]], [[regional language|regional]], [[minority language|minority]] and [[migrant language|migrant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; However, Orban agreed that the protection of [[language rights]] was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, &quot;When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;summary of hearing&quot;/&gt;

Orban's remit included the development of the European Indicator of Language Competence, the creation of a Business Forum on Multilingualism and ''Juvenes Translatores'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/translatores/ ec.europa.eu/translatores – Juvenes Translatores contest] (latin: young translators)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[translation]] contest between schools from all over Europe as part of the events marking the 50th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; In addition to the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 and other educational and cultural programmes, Orban promoted multilingualism within other relevant policies and programmes, including the [[Seventh Framework Programme|Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development]], the [[European Social Fund]] and [[immigration]] initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; He also intended to contribute to the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, where multilingualism played a fundamental part.&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt; On planning further policy, Orban promised to, &quot;carefully analyse the results from the Action Plan for the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity, the recommendations from the High Level Group on Multilingualism and the activities of the Commission internal network for multilingualism. Before the end of 2007, I would organise a [[Council of the European Union|Ministerial conference]] to discuss the way forward. I would then propose a new Action Plan in 2008 to continue work in this area.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;statement&quot;/&gt;

His views on multilingualism fall in line with the current European Union language policy as described in the Communication from the Commission &quot;A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism&quot; on 22 November 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Communication&quot;/&gt;

==Views on EU-Romania relations and the European integration==
Orban defended Romania's accession to the EU, believing that Romania can only gain from its entry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2253068,00.html Romanian to Become EU's First Commissioner for Multilingualism], ''Deutsche Welle'', November 11, 2006.

Retrieved on February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the &quot;future of Europe&quot;, Orban believes in a strong, cohesive European Union capable of being a major actor on the global scene. In addition, he stressed the need to increase the pace of the implementation of the [[Lisbon Strategy]], a ten-year strategy designed to make the European Union the world's most competitive economy by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/commission/2006_enlarg/questionnaires/general_reply_orban_en.pdf European Parliament Hearings – Answers to questionnaire for Commissioner designate Mr Leonard Orban (Multilingualism): part A – General questions], (PDF) ''European Parliament website'', October 20, 2006. Retrieved on February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionally, he supported the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], voted down in referendums in France and Netherlands in 2005, believing that it should be ratified by the member states without further negotiations or without excluding some of its provisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;summary of hearing&quot;/&gt;
