The '''2015 South Indian floods''' resulted from heavy rainfall generated by the annual [[northeast monsoon]] in November–December 2015. They affected the [[Coromandel Coast]] region of the [[South India]]n states of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]], and the union territory of [[Puducherry]], with Tamil Nadu and the city of [[Chennai]] particularly hard-hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunkmonday&quot; /&gt; More than 500 people were killed&lt;ref name=&quot;claimed_lives&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lives_lost&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TNrain&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=347 dead in rain-related incidents since Oct 1 in TN|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/347-dead-in-rainrelated-incidents-since-oct-1-in-tn/article7969839.ece|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=The Hindu|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;struggles&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Janardhanan|first=Arun|title=Now Chennai struggles to lay its dead to rest |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/now-chennai-struggles-to-lay-its-dead-to-rest/|accessdate=9 December 2015|work=The Indian Express|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;APHomeMin&quot; /&gt; and over 18&amp;nbsp;[[lakh]] (1.8&amp;nbsp;million) people were displaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;reunite&quot; /&gt; With estimates of damages and losses ranging from nearly {{INRConvert|200|b|0}} to over {{INRConvert|1|t|0}},&lt;ref name=&quot;floodlosses&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;floods_washed&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dna015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;assistance&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;centre&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;industries&quot; /&gt; the floods were the costliest to have occurred in 2015, and were among the costliest natural disasters of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;costliest&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Narasimhan|first=T.E.|title=Chennai floods are world's 8th most expensive natural disaster in 2015|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/chennai-floods-are-world-s-8th-most-expensive-natural-disaster-in-2015-115121100487_1.html|accessdate=12 December 2015|work=Business Standard|date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flooding has been attributed to the [[2014-16 El Niño event]].

==Background==

===Geographical and meteorological explanation===
From October to December each year, a very large area of south India, including Tamil Nadu, the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh and the union territory of Puducherry, receives up to 30 percent of its annual rainfall from the [[northeast monsoon]] (or winter monsoon). The northeast monsoon is the result of the annual gradual retreat of monsoonal rains from [[northeastern India]]. Unlike during the regular monsoon, rainfall during the northeast monsoon is sporadic, but typically far exceeds the amount produced by the regular monsoon by up to 90 percent. This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by an El Nino year, which 2015 was.&lt;ref name=&quot;underwater&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sinha; Janardhanan|first=Amitabh; Arun|title=Extra rain and poor urban planning: Why Chennai went under water|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/extra-rain-poor-urban-planning-why-chennai-went-under-water/|access-date=9 December 2015|work=The Indian Express|date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh usually bear the brunt of heavy rains that occur during the northeast monsoon; with numerous river systems and wetlands, Puducherry and eastern Tamil Nadu are prone to flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;underwater&quot;/&gt; The city of Chennai alone experienced five major floods between 1943 and 2005, with the 1943, 1978 and 2005 floods causing particularly severe damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When cities went under water|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/floods-in-tamil-nadu-cities/article7965264.ece|access-date=10 December 2015|work=The Hindu|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, unplanned and often illegal urban development has led to many wetlands and natural sinks being built over; this, along with ageing civic infrastructure and poorly designed drainage systems, has resulted in an increased frequency of severe flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;underwater&quot;/&gt;

===The weather systems===
On 8 November 2015, during the [[2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|annual cyclone season]], a [[low pressure area]] consolidated into a depression and slowly intensified into a deep depression before crossing the coast of [[Tamil Nadu]] near [[Pondicherry|Puducherry]] the following day. Because of land interaction and high vertical wind shear, the system weakened into a well-marked low pressure area over north Tamil Nadu on 10 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;havoc&quot;/&gt; The system brought very heavy rainfall over the coastal and the north interior districts of Tamil Nadu. On 15 November, well-marked low pressure area moved northwards along the Tamil Nadu coast, dropping huge amounts of rainfall over coastal Tamil Nadu and [[Andhra Pradesh]] with 24‑hour totals peaking at 370&amp;nbsp;mm in [[Ponneri]]. [[Chennai International Airport]] recorded 266&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall in 24 hours. On 28–29 November, another system developed and arrived over Tamil Nadu on 30 November, bringing additional rain and flooding. The system dropped 490&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall at [[Tambaram]] in 24 hours starting 8:30 am on 1 December. Very heavy rains led to flooding across the entire stretch of coast from Chennai to [[Cuddalore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;threat&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the wake of the floods, several citizens' groups and political parties, notably the [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]] (PMK), strongly recommended  that [[Tiruchirappalli]] be designated as the second, administrative capital of Tamil Nadu, due to its centralised location, the presence of a large international airport, a low level of congestion, the availability of vacant government land and a decreased likelihood of flooding. PMK leader [[S. Ramadoss]] said the party would seriously consider the matter if it came to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Make Tiruchi second capital of TN: Ramadoss|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/make-tiruchi-second-capital-of-tn-ramadoss/article8009623.ece|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=The Hindu|date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Association floated to press for a new capital|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/association-floated-to-press-for-a-new-capital/article8033205.ece|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=The Hindu|date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central government survey teams conducted studies on the extent on the flooding in early January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Central team visits flood-hit areas of Tuticorin|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/central-team-visits-floodhit-areas-of-tuticorin/article8075266.ece|accessdate=19 February 2016|work=The Hindu|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 29 December 2015, the Tamil Nadu state government began a massive [[slum clearance]] programme, demolishing dozens of illegally constructed dwellings in the [[Saidapet]] area of Chennai. Located along the banks of the [[Adyar River]], the area had been among those worst affected by the floods. The residents were rehoused in government housing being built in Okkiyam [[Thoraipakkam]] and [[Perumbakkam]]. The government further announced that the rehoused residents would receive an allowance of {{INRConvert|30|k|0}} a year to help them resettle. Medical care would be arranged, children would be enrolled in schools and vocational training would be provided for job-seekers.&lt;ref name=&quot;removal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Removal of huts along Adyar river begins |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/removal-of-huts-along-adyar-river-begins/article8043536.ece?ref=relatedNews|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=The Hindu|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite voicing concern over their ability to find new jobs, many of those resettled expressed satisfaction with the new flats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poorvaja|first=S.|title=The challenges of a fresh start |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/the-challenges-of-a-fresh-start/article8047091.ece?ref=relatedNews|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=The Hindu|date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By March 2016, 4,100 families who had lived in the area had been resettled, and the city corporation had cleared away hundreds of illegally encroaching constructions, widening the Adyar River in Saidapet to 220 metres from its previous 50 metre width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lopez|first=Aloysius|title=Encroachments cleared |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/encroachments-cleared/article8320214.ece|accessdate=26 March 2016|work=The Hindu|date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chennai Corporation said civic construction projects totalling {{INRConvert|400|c|0}} and halted by the floods would resume in earnest, and would be completed by 29 February 2016. The corporation also announced that damaged roads would quickly be re-paved and previously shelved storm drain projects would resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chennai floods aftermath: Work on civic projects on overdrive |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/work-on-civic-projects-on-an-overdrive/article8052318.ece|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=The Hindu|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2016, repair work on the damaged boundary walls at Chennai International Airport had largely been completed. Based on the findings of a preliminary report submitted by an IIT-Madras research team, the [[Airports Authority of India]] (AAI) announced plans to conduct a full study of the causes of excessive flooding at the airport, along with plans to implement a comprehensive flood-management system; the study was expected to be completed by the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sekhar|first=Sunitha|title=Study to analyse airport flooding in the pipeline|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/study-to-analyse-airport-flooding-in-the-pipeline/article8250442.ece|accessdate=26 March 2016|work=The Hindu|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, Chennai's Water Resources Department began work to revitalise and repair reservoirs in Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills and Chembarambakkam. The project would include work to strengthen bunds, install flood warning systems and repair sluice gates; it was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2016, at a cost of {{INRConvert|13|c|0}}. Local NGOs and hydrology experts emphasized the continued need for a comprehensive action plan to protect urban water bodies, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lakshmi|first=K.|title=Work on sprucing up reservoirs starts |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/work-on-sprucing-up-reservoirs-starts/article8395155.ece|accessdate=26 March 2016|work=The Hindu|date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, 2016|state legislative assembly elections]] in May 2016, the AIADMK was returned to power in Tamil Nadu, albeit with a reduced majority. The party lost eight seats to the opposing DMK in Chennai district and a further eight seats elsewhere; its losses were attributed to its perceived failure to properly address the flood crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Did the floods drown AIADMK?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/aiadmk-wins-just-six-seats-in-chennai/article8623878.ece|accessdate=15 June 2016|work=The Hindu|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 June, K. Rosaiah, the governor of Tamil Nadu, announced the state government would soon develop comprehensive flood protection plans for Chennai and its surrounding coastal districts; he said the emphasis would be on  providing better roads, storm water drains, solid waste management, sewerage management and street lights. The initiatives would be synergised with the Smart Cities Programme and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. Funding had also been obtained from the World Bank and from the Asian Development Bank for climate-change impact reduction initiatives, as well as for the restoration of water bodies and tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flood protection plan soon: Governor|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/flood-protection-plan-soon-says-tamil-nadu-governor/article8737817.ece|accessdate=18 June 2016|work=The Hindu|date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2016, however, local citizens' groups said no constructive work had been done to rejuvenate local water bodies and that the effects of a similar north-east monsoon would have an equally destructive impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will this monsoon be worse than Dec. 2015 floods?|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/Will-this-monsoon-be-worse-than-Dec-2015-floods/2016/07/11/article3522838.ece|accessdate=15 July 2016|work=The New Indian Express|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, a parliamentary panel recommended an immediate special relief and rehabilitation package for Tamil Nadu, in &quot;consonance with the demand of the state.&quot; Observing a monetary estimate for flood-related damages in the state could total &quot;thousands of crores,&quot; the panel's recommendations included a crackdown on criminals involved in illegal construction, a swift removal of illegal encroachments from flood channels and riverbeds, the preparation of a calamity map of all important cities and including &quot;standard vulnerability indices,&quot; and a continued level of high vigilance by central and state authorities, notably by the Home Affairs Ministry and the National Disaster Management Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parliamentary panel bats for immediate relief for flood-hit TN|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Parliamentary-panel-bats-for-immediate-relief-for-flood-hit-TN/2016/08/13/article3577386.ece|accessdate=12 August 2016|work=The New Indian Express|date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of causes==

===Unregulated urban planning and illegal construction===
Union Minister for Environment and Forests [[Prakash Javadekar]] termed the Chennai floods a &quot;natural disaster of unprecedented scale&quot;, and said it provided lessons to improve urban planning and improve city governance. &quot;Chennai gives a lesson, and we must learn from this lesson and improve our urban planning and improve city governance, which is very essential.&quot; He also criticised the Chennai Corporation for not having done enough &quot;to remove all encroachments. Unless you allow the drains to flow freely to the sea, water will be clogged and that is what has unfortunately happened.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;javadekar&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Chennai rains a 'natural disaster of unprecedented scale': Javadekar|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prakash-javadekar-says-chennai-rains-are-a-natural-disaster-of-unprecedented-scale/article7949452.ece|accessdate=4 December 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunita Narain]], the director of the [[Centre for Science and Environment]] (CSE) [[think tank]], said the unprecedented floods in the Chennai metropolitan region were the direct result of unregulated urbanisation. According to Narain, &quot;our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar, etc., have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;unregulated&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Vasudeva|first=Vikas|title=Unregulated urbanisation to blame for Chennai flooding: CSE experts|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unregulated-urbanisation-to-blame-for-chennai-flooding-cse-experts/article7945813.ece|accessdate=3 December 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research conducted by CSE, Chennai had over 600 lakes in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 showed only a fraction of them to be in a healthy condition. State records have shown the total area of 19 major lakes shrank from 1,130 hectares in the 1980s to around 645 hectares in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity. Drains carrying surplus water from tanks to other wetlands have also been encroached upon, while city storm water drains are clogged and require immediate desilting. Chennai has only 855&amp;nbsp;km of stormwater drains against 2,847&amp;nbsp;km of urban roads, resulting in flooding after even a marginally heavy downpour.&lt;ref name=&quot;unregulated&quot;/&gt;

===Improper design and maintenance of drainage systems===
Media reports stated the [[Chennai Corporation]] had ignored September warnings of above-average monsoonal rains issued by the [[Indian Meteorological Department]], and that extensive and costly projects begun in 2013 to desilt city storm drains had been ineffectively conducted. The drains themselves were reported to have been shoddily built and improperly designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Highest rainfall in 10 years washes away Chennai’s expensive drainage, desilting projects|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/highest-rainfall-in-10-years-washes-away-chennais-expensive-drainage-desilting-projects/|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|CAG]] report revealed that a diversion channel from the [[Buckingham canal]] near Okkiyum Maduvu to the sea (a drain project under the JNNURM scheme) could have saved South Chennai from flooding; the government, however, dropped the ₹100 crore scheme, which, had it been completed, would have drained floodwater from southern neighbourhood at a rate of 3,500 cubic feet per second. The 2014 CAG report said the defective planning of flood control projects caused delays and increased costs, defeating the objective of the scheme. &quot;The fact is that alleviation of inundation of flood water in Chennai city remains largely unachieved&quot;, it said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flood: Chennai corpn learned little from CAG advice|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Flood-Chennai-corpn-learned-little-from-CAG-advice/articleshow/49852204.cms|accessdate=25 November 2015|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate-change related===
Union Environment and Forests Minister Javadekar said the exact causes of the flooding – whether the result of climate change or stemming from other causes – remained in &quot;a grey area&quot; as experts had differing opinions. Regarding the current floods, he said the United Nations would not deem the evidence conclusive enough to be able to reach a judgment. &quot;One thing is sure, climate change brings such disasters more frequently. So [the] frequency, [the] ferocity of untimely rains increases, [along with] erratic monsoons, droughts and floods; all these are caused [by climate change].&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;javadekar&quot;/&gt; He subsequently clarified his position on the Tamil Nadu floods in a written statement addressed to the Rajya Sabha. According to Javadekar, the recent extreme rainfall across the region was &quot;highly localised&quot; and could not be definitively attributed to the effects of climate-change. &quot;[The] extreme rainfall that occurred over [the] coastal districts of Tamil Nadu is part of the natural variability of the Indian monsoon system. Although some studies have reported an increase in frequency and intensity of extremes in rainfall during the past 40–50 years, their attribution to global warming is not established.&quot; Javadekar said the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and local assessments have indicated that extreme rainfall events will likely increase in frequency by the end of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tamil Nadu rain ‘highly localised’ event, no link with global warming: Javadekar tells RS|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-rain-highly-localised-event-no-link-with-global-warming/article8014383.ece|accessdate=21 December 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune showed extreme precipitation events had increased in frequency and intensity in India over the period from 1950 to the 2000s; while CSE’s climate change experts recommend detailed attribution studies to establish more links between the Chennai floods and climate change, they did state that existing scientific studies establish a possible connection.&lt;ref name=&quot;unregulated&quot;/&gt;

==Controversies==

===Inadequate response of state authorities===
Many flood victims across Chennai and Tamil Nadu protested the state's ineffectual response and the lack of help from authorities. In the chief minister's state assembly  constituency of [[Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar (State Assembly Constituency)|Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar]], flood victims heckled senior ministers Natham Viswanathan, Sellur Raju and Gokul Indira following their visit on 4 December, forcing them to make a hasty retreat. At a subsequent press conference, Tamil Nadu Power Minister Natham Viswanathan and chief secretary Gnanadesikan claimed that relief and rescue work were in full swing and &quot;extraordinary&quot;. Viswanathan deflected opposition criticism of relief efforts as politically motivated, in light of upcoming assembly elections. He claimed people in even the worst-affected localities had refused to leave their homes and had accepted only food relief from official agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jaya photo on relief packages, Bahubali reference irk Chennaites |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/jaya-photo-on-relief-packages-bahubali-reference-irk-chennaites/story-uuUv65tmvnqnxtbCj4iRVN.html|accessdate=5 December 2015|work=Hindustan Times|date=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a statement by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa that the flooding had been the result of exceptional rainfall, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) issued a strong criticism on 16 November, stating that the flooding in Chennai could have been averted if local and state officials had taken strong precautions. The state BJP president, [[Tamilisai Soundararajan]], said: &quot;Even if it was six months of rain on a single day, the administration should have been ready to tackle it.&quot; Tamilisai mentioned the cleaning and de-silting of the [[Cooum]] River would allow it to divert large amounts of runoff during the monsoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt. did not take precautions: BJP |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/govt-did-not-take-precautions-bjp/article7885641.ece|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Chennai area, residents staged protests and criticised the state government for its lack of any rescue response in their locality.&lt;ref name=&quot;flee&quot;/&gt; In Puducherry, AIADMK legislator A Anbazhagan said that the government was not providing relief to affected people and had not taken any precautions, contrary to the government's assurances; he added the administration failed to promptly mobilise various essential departments and urged the territorial administration to carefully prepare a report to ensure delivery of relief to those affected.&lt;ref name=&quot;flays&quot;/&gt; Following numerous complaints regarding the Tamil Nadu state government's lack of relief effort coordination, a [[public-interest litigation]] petition was filed in the [[Madras High Court]]; on 11 December, Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Puspha Sathyanarayana heard the petition and converted it to ''[[suo moto]]'' proceedings. The justices directed the state government to report its relief-effort coordination measures to the court by 16 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= -|first=Sureshkumar|title=HC seeks details of coordination in flood relief work by December 16|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-floods-madras-high-court-seeks-details-of-coordination-in-relief-work-by-december-16/article7977992.ece|accessdate=13 December 2015|work=The Hindu|date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Tamil Nadu government announced a flood-relief package on 7 December, many flood survivors criticised it as meagre and &quot;insulting.&quot; DMK leader [[M.K. Stalin]] said the state's financial assistance of {{INRConvert|5|k|0}} for each displaced family &quot;would not be of much help to the people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flood-hit people call Jaya’s Rs 5,000–10,000 financial aid an ‘insult’ |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/jaya-s-flood-relief-package-is-an-insult-chennai-residents/story-bFw1G3kRlhFN1u3Sr5qT8N.html |accessdate=8 December 2015|work=Hindustan Times|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted in the worst-affected districts of Chennai by a group of volunteer organisations between 15–30 December found that most families had lost their sources of livelihood, and that the amount of state financial assistance was insufficient. Lacking ration cards, migrant workers were the worst off, as they were ineligible for any state assistance. Many residents in those areas complained the state authorities had insufficiently taken measures to prepare for the floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flood-hit people need more relief|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/floodhit-people-need-more-relief/article8104337.ece|accessdate=19 February 2016|work=The Hindu|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights]] (NCDHR) and the Social Awareness Society for Youths (SASY) surveyed 8,400 [[Dalit]] and non-Dalit families in 20 villages in the [[Cuddalore]] region in December 2015 and found that around 90 percent of the houses, livestock and crops destroyed in the floods belonged to Dalit families, who made up the majority of flood-displaced people. The final report alleged dominant [[caste]] people blocked access to clean water, medicines; official relief measures were concentrated in more accessible upper-caste neighbourhoods. On average, a majority of Dalit settlements were located only 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from rivers, canals and the sea and most primary health centres were located in dominant caste neighbourhoods and were, on average, three km from Dalit settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dalits suffered more than others in flood-hit Cuddalore: Report |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/dalits-suffered-more-than-others-in-flood-hit-cuddalore-report/story-TQfazyjyzWfD2tUjZ6qJyM.html|accessdate=7 December 2015|work=Hindustan Times|date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of AIADMK===
The [[AIADMK]] received heavy public criticism following reports of party workers pasting photographs of party leader and Tamil Nadu chief minister [[Jayalalithaa]] on relief materials, erecting banners and posters praising her, allegedly halting relief shipments en route to Chennai to paste her photos on relief packages and threatening volunteers. These incidents were reported mostly in Chennai and Cuddalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dna Web Team |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-chennai-floods-relief-materials-allegedly-being-allowed-only-after-carrying-jayalalithaa-stickers-2152334 |title=Chennai floods: AIADMK denies allegations of relief materials being allowed only after carrying Jayalalithaa stickers  &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis |work=Daily News and Analysis |date=5 December 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As Chennai battles floods, 'Amma' Jayalalithaa makes appearance as Sivagami of Bahubali|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/tamil-nadu/jayalalithaas-bahubali-like-poster-emerges-amid-heavy-flooding-in-chennai-see-pic_1830317.html|accessdate=5 December 2015|work=Zee News|date=4 December 2015|location=Chennai}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident caught on video and widely broadcast on Tamil television, an AIADMK functionary mouthing expletives and accompanied by henchmen was seen intimidating volunteers from Bengaluru who were preparing food in Anna Nagar for distribution to flood-affected people; the cadre demanded 2,000 relief packets so he could be seen distributing them.&lt;ref name=&quot;cadre&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Naig|first=Udhav|title=AIADMK cadre confronts volunteers distributing relief |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/aiadmk-cadre-confront-volunteers-distributing-relief/article7959682.ece|accessdate=9 December 2015|work=The Hindu|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The party also released a poem on social media praising Jayalalithaa despite near-universal condemnation of government relief efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;paen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=AIADMK sings paeans to Amma, rivals slam timing |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/AIADMK-sings-paeans-to-Amma-rivals-slam-timing/articleshow/50069312.cms|accessdate=9 December 2015|work=The Times of India|date=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the mounting criticism, an AIADMK party official said the media was distorting events and attempting to smear the party before the upcoming assembly elections; however, he promised the party would take strict action against those obstructing relief work.&lt;ref name=&quot;cadre&quot;/&gt; CPI (Marxist) leader U Vasuki said, &quot;The whole state is in crisis. This is not the right time to shower praise. Moreover, the state [government] has not done anything commendable to [merit] praise [of its] relief efforts. The timing of such propaganda is shocking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;paen&quot;/&gt;

===Media controversies===
In Tamil Nadu, partisan television channels associated with the ruling [[AIADMK]] and the opposing [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] political parties were criticised for using the disaster for their own political purposes. Also, several claimed that the political parties obstructed the flood relief efforts of the volunteers for their own gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tamil Nadu floods: Parties score points through TV reports |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-floods-parties-score-points-through-tv-reports/story-lCQcZwo3NXQS8XCTPUc74J.html|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; National media outlets were widely criticised on social media for failing to adequately report on the flood crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/chennaifloods-social-media-users-slam-news-media-poor-flood-coverage-657747 |title=#ChennaiFloods: Social media users slam news media for poor flood coverage |publisher=Ibtimes.co.in |date=2 December 2015 |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December, the government Press Information Bureau (PIB) released an edited photo showing the Prime Minister looking down from an aircraft window which was removed after criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;mockery&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Chennai floods: Edited Modi photo sparks online mockery|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34991822|accessdate=4 December 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PIB ‘regrets’ modifying PM Modi’s Chennai aerial survey photo|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/pib-regrets-manipulating-pm-s-chennai-aerial-survey-photo/story-wxzy28bYKXllOIK3mtueBL.html|accessdate=4 December 2015|work=Hindustan Times|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
