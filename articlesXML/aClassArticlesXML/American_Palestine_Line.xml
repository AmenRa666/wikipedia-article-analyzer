[[File:American Palestine Line house flag.svg|right|thumb|The flag of the American Palestine Line]]
The '''American Palestine Line''' was a [[steamship]] company, formed in 1924 in the U.S., for the purpose of providing direct passenger service from New York to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and was reportedly the first steamship company owned and operated by Jews. The company negotiated to purchase three [[ocean liner]]s from the [[United States Shipping Board]], but it was only able to purchase one, {{SS|President Arthur}}, a former [[North German Lloyd]] steamer that operated as ''Princess Alice'' before being seized by the United States during [[World War I]]. After refurbishing the liner, the company inaugurated service between New York and Palestine in March 1925, when ''President Arthur'' sailed on her [[maiden voyage]]. A crowd of 15,000 witnessed ceremonies that included songs, prayers, and speeches in English and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. The company claimed that ''President Arthur'' was the first ocean liner to fly the [[Flag of Israel|Zionist flag]] at sea and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A14F63C551B7A93CBA91788D85F418285F9  &quot;Elizabeth Chisolm Engaged to Wed&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 9, 1925. Accessed July 9, 2008. &quot;The President Arthur will be the first ship in 2,000 years to sail under the Zionist Flag.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The line had labor difficulties and financial difficulties throughout its existence. On ''President Arthur''&amp;nbsp;'s first trip in 1925, rumors of a mutiny were reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'', and several crew members got into an altercation with members of the [[Blackshirts]], the Italian fascist paramilitary group, when the liner made an intermediary stop in [[Naples]]. On her second voyage, the ship's [[master-at-arms]] was killed by a fellow crew member. Financial difficulties included unpaid bills and resultant court actions as well as accusations of fraud against company officers that were leveled in the press. In late 1925 the company was placed in the hands of a [[receiver (legal)|receiver]]; ''President Arthur''—after a [[Multiple-alarm fire|two-alarm fire]] in her forward cargo hold—ended up back in the hands of the [[United States Shipping Board]] (USSB), and the company's office furniture and fixtures were sold at auction in early 1926.

== Background ==
[[File:SS Princess Alice interned at Cebu, Philippines.jpg|thumb|right|{{SS|President Arthur}} was the former SS ''Princess Alice'' of [[North German Lloyd]], seen here while interned in the [[Philippines]].]]
The newly formed American Palestine Line, reportedly the first ever steamship company owned and operated by Jews, began working to institute direct passenger service from New York to Palestine.&lt;ref name=NYT-1924-10-10&gt;{{cite news | title = Zionists to run fleet | work = The New York Times | date = 1924-10-10 | page = 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, the company began negotiations with the United States Shipping Board (USSB) to purchase three former [[German Empire|German]] ocean liners, sister ships {{SS|President Fillmore|1899|2}} and {{SS|President Arthur||2}} and the smaller {{SS|Mount Clay||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The three liners had operated under the names of {{SS|Hamburg||2}} (Bonsor, Vol. 1, p. 410), {{SS|Princess Alice|1900|2}} (Drechsel, pp. 338–39), and {{SS|Prinz Eitel Friedrich|1904|2}} (Drechsel, p. 341), respectively, in German passenger service.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9, 1924, the American Palestine Line's president—Jacob S. Strahl, a [[New York Supreme Court]] justice—announced the purchase of ''President Arthur'' from the USSB, with plans to begin the Palestine service the following March.&lt;ref name=NYT-1924-10-10 /&gt; Strahl also publicly announced American Palestine's intent to acquire ''President Fillmore'' at the same time;&lt;ref name=NYT-1924-10-10 /&gt; plans 
for that acquisition and that of ''Mount Clay'', however, never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;Bonsor, Vol. 1, p. 410; Drechsel, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ship ==
{{Main|USS Princess Matoika (ID-2290)}}
SS ''President Arthur'' was formerly ''Kiautschou'', a {{sclass|Barbarossa|ocean liner|1}} launched in September 1900 for the [[Hamburg America Line]]'s [[Far East]] passenger and mail service. When Hamburg America withdrew from the service, the liner was traded to North German Lloyd, and regularly used—under the new name of ''Princess Alice''—on both [[North Atlantic]] and Far East passenger routes. The liner was interned in the U.S.-controlled [[Philippines]] at the outset of [[World War I]] and was seized upon the American entry to the conflict. The ship was used as a [[transport ship]] for both the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]  and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] under the name ''Princess Matoika''. After some post-war use as a passenger liner and yet another name change—this one in honor of the 21st [[List of Presidents of the United States|U.S. President]], [[Chester A. Arthur]]—she was taken out of service when changes in U.S. laws severely curtailed the number of immigrants that could enter the country in the early 1920s. At the time of the purchase by American Palestine, the ship had been laid up in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] since late 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Drechsel, pp. 338–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

News reports the following month fixed the purchase price of ''President Arthur'' at $60,000 cash, plus assurances that the liner would be reconditioned within six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jews to buy liner; plan service to Palestine | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 1924-11-05 | page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced plans for reconditioning included reducing passenger capacity to 675 and increasing the cargo capacity to {{convert|4000|LT|t|lk=on}}. Also on tap were swimming pools, a game room, a gymnasium, a lecture hall, a social hall, and a [[Movie theater|moving picture theater]].&lt;ref name=NYT-1924-10-10 /&gt; The line had originally planned to change the name of the liner to ''White Palace'', but that was never brought about.&lt;ref name=Drechsel-v1-339&gt;Drechsel, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stephen Samuel Wise cropped.jpg|upright|right|thumb|At the ceremonies for the maiden voyage of SS ''President Arthur'', Rabbi [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Stephen S. Wise]] prayed for the voyage's success.]]
After undergoing reconditioning at [[Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Company|Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair]] in [[Brooklyn]], ''President Arthur'' was taken out for a {{convert|100|nmi|km|adj=on}} [[shakedown cruise]] on March 7, 1925. Steaming off the New Jersey coast, ''President Arthur'', expected by American Palestine officials to top out at {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}, reached a reported maximum cruising speed of {{convert|19.7|kn|km/h}}, which company officials claimed would reduce her travel time to Palestine by two or three days. At the end of the shakedown, the liner was docked at the foot of [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|West Houston Street]] in preparation for her maiden voyage five days later.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-08&gt;{{cite news | title = Palestine liner tested | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1925-03-08 | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition of ''President Arthur'' by American Palestine inspired Jewish lyricist Solomon Small to pen the song &quot;President Arthur's Zion Ship&quot; which contained these lines in its [[refrain]]:&lt;ref name=Small_song&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewsinamerica.org/imagegallerylist.php |title=Our Story Image Gallery List |publisher=[[Center for Jewish History]] |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-04-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409180945/http://www.jewsinamerica.org/imagegallerylist.php |archivedate=2008-04-09 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Palestine service begins ==
On the morning of March 12, 1925, crowds started gathering at ''President Arthur''&amp;nbsp;'s pier at 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. By the time the ceremonies—broadcast by New York's municipal radio station, [[WNYC]]—opened with the singing of both &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot; and &quot;[[Hatikvah]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-13&gt;{{cite news | title = Palestine liner gets big send-off | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-03-13 | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the crowd had swelled to 15,000 in number.&lt;ref name=AC-1925-03-13&gt;{{cite news | title = Zionists sail for dedication of university | work = [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution#The Atlanta Constitution|The Atlanta Constitution]] | date = 1925-03-13 | page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festivities included speeches and prayers from [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Rabbi]] [[Morris S. Margolies]]; [[David Yellin]], Vice Mayor of [[Jerusalem]], who addressed the crowd in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]; Rabbi [[David de Sola Pool]];&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-13 /&gt; and Rabbi [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Stephen S. Wise]].&lt;ref name=AC-1925-03-13 /&gt; [[Hazzan|Cantor]] [[Yossele Rosenblatt|Josef Rosenblatt]] sang to the crowd and a telegram from New York merchant [[Nathan Straus]], unable to attend the event, was read aloud. American Palestine Line president Jacob S. Strahl, in his remarks, made the claim that the sailing of ''President Arthur'' marked the first appearance &quot;in more than 2,000 years of the [[Flag of Israel|flag of Judea]] on the high seas&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-13 /&gt;

Many passengers on ''President Arthur''&amp;nbsp;'s maiden voyage for the American Palestine Line attended the ceremonies.]]
The ship, with [[Star of David|Stars of David]] painted on her [[steamship funnel|funnels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Zion flag aloft as 400 sail to promised land | work = Chicago Daily Tribune | date = 1925-03-13 | page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pulled away from the dock at eight minutes before noon, nearly an hour later than her planned departure time, and headed to [[Haifa]], with an intermediate stop in [[Naples]].&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-13 /&gt; On board were some 400&amp;nbsp;passengers from all over the United States and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = City bids godspeed to Holy Land ship | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-03-12 | page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of whom were tourists wanting to see the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name=AC-1925-03-13 /&gt; Many of the passengers, including a contingent from the [[University of Manitoba]] in [[Winnipeg]],&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-13 /&gt; were also sailing in order to attend the dedication of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] at [[Mount Scopus]] by former British [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Arthur Balfour|Lord Balfour]]. ''President Arthur'' also carried agricultural equipment and trucks to be used for farm development in Palestine.&lt;ref name=AC-1925-03-13 /&gt; In addition, the liner featured Bernice P. Schmitt and Rebeccca Adelman, who, according to contemporary news reports, were the first ever female officers on an ocean liner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Capt. W. J. Breen, S. S. President Arthur, has commissioned… | type =  photo caption | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 1925-03-17 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman Hirsch, a Jewish male from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] on a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]], kept an account of ''President Arthur''&amp;nbsp;'s maiden voyage. On Friday, March 13, one day into the voyage, Hirsch reported that the [[torah]] was dedicated and a procession to songs and music accompanied a march over all parts of the ship. Afterwards, Rabbi Aaron Ashinsky of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], officiated at a service held in a chapel provided for the passengers.&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ccastle.org/palestn1.html | title = My trip to Palestine | format =  Personal diary from June 1925 | accessdate = 2008-07-08 | last = Hirsch | first = Herman | date = 2004-05-09 | publisher = Art Hirsch | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050206045327/www.ccastle.org/palestn1.html | archivedate = 2005-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers published radio dispatches emanating from ''President Arthur'' throughout her maiden voyage, thanks to a powerful new radio set installed aboard the liner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ship has powerful set | work = [[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date = 1925-04-03 | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 14 the liner was able to avoid the worst of a [[gale]] that slowed {{SS|Leviathan||2}} of the United States Lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Passengers for Palestine enjoying trip, says a radio | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-03-18 | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 26 ''President Arthur'' was able to avoid a [[waterspout]] {{convert|50|nmi|km}} east of [[Gibraltar]]. At Gibraltar, the local Jewish community [[ship chartering|chartered]] a ship to escort ''President Arthur'' through the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Sights huge water spout | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-03-27 | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship docked at Naples on March 27,&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-29&gt;{{cite news | title = Zion liner due at Haifa | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-03-29 | page = E2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; four days later than her planned arrival there,&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-13 /&gt; and departed the same day.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-29 /&gt;

The liner arrived at Haifa on March 31, nearly a week late.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-03-13 /&gt; Herman Hirsch reported that a passenger from Chicago, Jacob Drapekin, 72, had died aboard the ship on March 24. The man's dying wish was to be buried in the Holy Land, and the crew of ''President Arthur'' helped fulfill his wishes. After arrival in Haifa, his flag-draped coffin was placed on deck and services were conducted in English and [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] by Rabbi Ashinsky before the body was taken ashore for interment.&lt;ref name=Hirsch /&gt; A sizable crowd, comprising delegations from [[Jerusalem]], [[Jaffa]], and [[Tel Aviv]], greeted the arriving ship. Most of the passengers on ''President Arthur'' were hurried to Jerusalem for the Hebrew University dedication ceremony the next day.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-04-02&gt;{{cite news | title = Holy Land greets New York steamer | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-04-02 | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anchorage at Haifa, early 20th century.jpg|right|upright|thumb|The anchorage at [[Haifa]] as it appeared around the time of ''President Arthur''&amp;nbsp;'s visits]]
''President Arthur'' departed Haifa on April 4 for a ten-day excursion in the Mediterranean, calling at Jaffa, [[Beirut]], [[Alexandria]], and Naples, among others, before sailing for the United States from Haifa on April 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Kings greet Zionist ship | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-04-04 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While docked at Naples on April 23, crewmen from ''President Arthur'' got into a confrontation with members of the [[Blackshirts]], the Italian fascist paramilitary group. Five of the Blackshirts had broken noses and [[black eye]]s; five American seamen were arrested and a further 15 Americans swam out to their steamer to avoid arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = American seamen clash with fascisti | work = The Washington Post | date = 1925-04-24 | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After calling at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]],&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567&gt;Bonsor, Vol. 2, p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt; the liner docked at Pier 86 in New York on March 8, carrying among its cargo 75,000&amp;nbsp;bags of onions from Alexandria, 16,000&amp;nbsp;cases of lemons from [[Palermo]], and two cases of Jaffa oranges for Nathan Straus. Only 500&amp;nbsp;well-wishers greeted the ship, arriving as it did on the [[Shabbat|Jewish sabbath]], but ''President Arthur'' was greeted by the largest police detail in many years because of rumors of a mutiny on board the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Big police squad meets Jewish ship | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-05-09 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources are unclear as to what actually happened aboard the ship, but it is known that virtually the entire crew, including the captain, was replaced before the next voyage.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-06-24&gt;{{cite news | title = Kills master-at-arms on President Arthur | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-06-24 | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12 ''President Arthur'' sailed on her second voyage to Palestine, counting Hemda Ben-Yahuda, the widow of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] linguist [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], among her passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Zionist ship sails after delay in river | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-05-12 | page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trip, an altercation between a [[Steward's Assistant|Steward]] and the ship's [[master-at-arms]] resulted in the death of the latter while the ship was in Naples.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-06-24 /&gt; Though the steward was arrested by Italian authorities, he was acquitted of murder by the [[Corte d'Assise|Assize Court]] at Naples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Acquits American sailor | work = The New York Times | date = 1926-02-14 | page = 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a return to New York, ''President Arthur'' sailed for Haifa on July 19 for what would be her last voyage for American Palestine.&lt;ref name=Bonsor-v2-567 /&gt;

== The demise of American Palestine ==
By this time, the company, perpetually undercapitalized by its own admission,&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-09-12&gt;{{cite news | title = Palestine ship line in receiver's hands | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-09-12 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; faced mounting financial troubles. On July 10, the company had to post an [[indemnity]] [[Surety bond|bond]] to avoid the impoundment of ''President Arthur'' for a disputed bill owed to Morse Dry Dock for the ship's 1924 refit.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-12-04 /&gt; The following month, ''President Arthur'' was used as collateral for $100,000 loan from a [[The Bronx|Bronx]] bank, but it was too little, too late.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-12-04 /&gt; American Palestine Line was placed in [[Administrative receivership|receivership]] on September 11 by federal judge [[Thomas D. Thacher]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court]] after suit was brought by a creditor.&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-09-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-12-04&gt;{{cite news | title = Say Palestine Line got bond by fraud | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-12-04 | page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight days later, ''President Arthur'', docked at the foot of [[34th Street (Manhattan)|West 34th Street]], experienced a two-alarm fire in her forward cargo hold that brought out both land-based firefighters and the [[New York City Fire Department]] [[fireboat]] ''James Duane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fire on President Arthur | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-09-20 | page = 28 }} The news article calls the fireboat the ''James Duana'', but listings at [http://www.fireboat.org/history/fleetlist.asp Fireboat.org] identify her as ''James Duane''.&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the line was accused of fraud in some of its prior financial dealings,&lt;ref name=NYT-1925-12-04 /&gt; charges the company denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Palestine Line upholds officers | work = The New York Times | date = 1925-12-15 | page = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time all the legal wrangling was finished, ''President Arthur'' was back in the hands of the USSB,&lt;ref name=LAT-1926-08-19&gt;{{cite news | title = Local yard to rebuild liner | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 1926-08-19 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the furniture and fixtures of the American Palestine offices were sold at [[public auction]] by the company's [[receiver (legal)|receiver]] in early March 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bankruptcy sales | work = The New York Times | date = 1926-02-24 | page = 38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
