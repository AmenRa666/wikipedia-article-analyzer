The '''visa policy of [[Lebanon]]''' deals with the requirements which a foreign national wishing to enter the Republic of [[Lebanon]] must meet to be permitted to travel to, enter and remain in the country.

Lebanese visas are documents issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its subsequent diplomatic missions abroad with the stated goal of regulating and facilitating migratory flows. Visitors to the Republic of [[Lebanon]] must obtain a [[visa (document)|visa]] from one of the [[List of diplomatic missions of Lebanon|Diplomatic missions of the Republic of Lebanon]]  unless they come from one of the 7 visa-exempt countries and territories or one of the 79 other countries and territories whose citizens are eligible for a visa on arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visa Information|url=https://www.timaticweb.com/cgi-bin/tim_website_client.cgi?FullText=1&amp;COUNTRY=LB&amp;SECTION=VI&amp;SUBSECTION=00&amp;user=KLMB2C&amp;subuser=KLMB2C|work=[[Timatic]]|publisher=[[IATA]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of member nations of the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]] and [[Jordan]] may travel to Republic of [[Lebanon]] without visa limits for a maximum stay of 6 months per year and 3 months per 6 months respectively, citizens of the 79 other countries and territories are granted a visa on arrival at Beirut International Airport or any other port of entry if there is no Israeli stamps, visas, or seals on their passport and are holding a telephone number, address in the Republic of [[Lebanon]], and a non-refundable return or circle trip ticket for a maximum stay of one month, extendable for 2 additional months. Citizens of [[Brazil]] and [[Turkey]] are instead granted a multiple entry visa valid for a maximum stay of 1 month and 3 months respectively. All visitors must hold a passport valid for 6 months beyond the period of intended stay and with two blank pages. An [[identity document]] is accepted in lieu of a passport for Jordanian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.general-security.gov.lb/Entry_visa/sub4.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.general-security.gov.lb/Entry_visa/The-formalities-required.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of [[Lebanon]] has a complicated visa policy, requiring visas from citizens of the countries and territories like - [[Brunei]], [[Seychelles]], [[Taiwan]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Vatican City]]. On the other hand, the Republic of [[Lebanon]] grants visa on arrival to citizens of countries and territories like - [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]].

[[Visa (document)#Visa run|Visa run]]s are not allowed, meaning that if foreigners wish to re-enter the Republic of Lebanon after their visa-free or VoA period has expired they should obtain a visa.

Visitors who have recently been to [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] are refused entry due to [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]].

Palestinian and Israeli citizens or any other person who holds any passport bearing stamps, visas, or seals issued by [[Israel]] are strictly prohibited from entry to the Republic of [[Lebanon]] and may be subject to arrest or detention for further inspection.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timaticweb.com/cgi-bin/tim_website_client.cgi?SpecData=1&amp;VISA=&amp;page=visa&amp;NA=ps&amp;AR=00&amp;PASSTYPES=PASS&amp;DE=LB&amp;user=KLMB2C&amp;subuser=KLMB2C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timaticweb.com/cgi-bin/tim_website_client.cgi?SpecData=1&amp;VISA=&amp;page=visa&amp;NA=IL&amp;AR=00&amp;PASSTYPES=PASS&amp;DE=LB&amp;user=KLMB2C&amp;subuser=KLMB2C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/lebanon.html&lt;/ref&gt;
