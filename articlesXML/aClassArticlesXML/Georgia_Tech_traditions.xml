      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76190">[[Image:TechTower.jpg|right|thumb|Georgia Tech's [[Tech Tower]]]]
Numerous '''[[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] legends and traditions''' have been established since the school's opening in 1888,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Hopkins Administration, 1888-1895 | work = &quot;A Thousand Wheels are set in Motion&quot;: The Building of Georgia Tech at the Turn of the 20th Century, 1888-1908 | publisher = Georgia Institute of Technology | url = http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/hopkins.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this ref is about the school's opening, not strictly about traditions--&gt; some of which have persisted for decades. Over time, the school has grown from a [[trade school]] into a large [[research university]], and the traditions reflect that heritage. One of the cherished holdovers from Tech's early years, a [[steam whistle]] blows five minutes before the hour, every hour from 7:55&amp;nbsp;am to 5:55&amp;nbsp;pm. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, it also blows at twenty-five minutes after the hour. It's for this reason that the faculty newspaper is named ''The Whistle''.

Some of the traditions are well-known, the most notable being the now-banned tradition of stealing the &quot;T&quot; from Tech Tower. [[Tech Tower]], Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. A number of times, students have orchestrated complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion have carried this act out successfully. One especially well-known tradition that has existed nearly since the school's establishment is [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate]], Georgia Tech's heated, long-standing and ongoing rivalry with the [[University of Georgia]]. The first known hostilities between the two schools trace back to 1891.

Several legends originated at Georgia Tech. [[George P. Burdell]], Tech's ever-present fictional student, was created in 1927 when a student filled out two application forms. Burdell went on to lead a long life; he earned several degrees, fought in World War II, and almost won ''Time''{{'}}s 2001 [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] award. Georgia Tech is also known for the largest margin of victory in a football game, achieved in their 222-0 thrashing of [[Cumberland University]] in the [[1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game]].

=== Stealing the T ===
{{main|Stealing the 'T'}}
[[Image:TechTowerSign.jpg|thumb|right|A closeup of [[Tech Tower]]]]
Tech's historic and primary administrative building, [[Tech Tower]], has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. Since 1969, students  on several occasions have orchestrated complex plans to scale Tech Tower and steal the huge symbolic letter T off the building. The 'T' was first stolen in April 1969 by a secret group of Georgia Tech students calling themselves the &quot;Magnificent Seven.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dismantling&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | title = Dismantling a tradition | work = Tech Topics | publisher = Georgia Tech Alumni Association | date = Winter 1999 | accessdate = 2007-02-02 | url = http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/techtopics/win99/hill.html#stealing | last = Coffee | first = Hoyt }}  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115061811/http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/techtopics/win99/hill.html#stealing |date=January 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The students, who were inspired by a similar prank that had taken place in 1968 at [[Harvard University]], planned the theft as a means of commemorating Institute President [[Edwin D. Harrison]]'s retirement. The 'T' was returned several days later via helicopter at the behest of Atlanta mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.|Ivan Allen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PresidentialOpinions&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | title = Presidential opinions change over time | url = http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2001-08-24/news/12 | date = 2001-08-24 | accessdate = 2007-02-01 | last = Shaw | first = Jody | work = [[The Technique]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following successful thefts, the T would then be returned at the halftime of the homecoming football game or would be returned to the lawn of the president's mansion, and the student's achievement would be celebrated. Tradition dictates that the first T to be stolen should be the one facing east, as this can most easily be seen from the I-75/I-85 [[Downtown Connector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the administration used to [[turn a blind eye]] to this practice,&lt;ref name=&quot;PresidentialOpinions&quot;/&gt; it is now officially discouraged, due to the risk of fatal falls and the potential for damage to the building, and equated to criminal activity (trespassing and theft). In recent years, this has become a serious offense, and perpetrators today would face a hefty fine to repair damages done to the building and a minimum of a semester-long suspension for attempting the feat, if not outright expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jody|last=Shaw|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2001-06-01/opinions/1|title=STAFF EDITORIAL: Stealing the ‘T’: Tradition or Trespassing?|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2001-06-01|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TBookT&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Security features such as security cameras, pressure sensitive roof tiling, and [[fiber optic]] cabling running throughout the letters have been added to the T to help prevent its theft and aid in catching the perpetrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBookT&quot;/&gt; In 1999, the T was successfully stolen by a group of &quot;six or seven people&quot; on the morning of June 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;vacation&quot;&gt;

=== Ramblin' Wreck ===
{{see also|Ramblin' Wreck|Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech}}
[[Image:Ramblinwreck.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ramblin' Wreck]] during a football game.]]
The term ''Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech'' refers to either current students or alumni, the school mascot, or the various sports teams.  Georgia Tech alumni, working on the construction of the [[Panama Canal]], were called Ramblin' Wrecks for the ingenious machines that they devised to transport themselves in and out of the jungles of [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2000-08-25/online%20exclusives/7|title=It’s the most beautiful old car in the world...|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2000-08-25|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These devices and their creators were nicknamed Ramblin' Wrecks from Georgia Tech.  Since then the term Ramblin' Wreck has been applied to a graduate or current student of Georgia Tech.  The actual [[Ramblin' Wreck]] is a 1930 [[Ford Model A (1927)|Ford Model A Sports Coupe]] first acquired by then-associate dean of students [[James E. Dull]], in 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;season&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/1999-09-17/campus%20life/7|title=Ramblins: Football season brings rat caps and fight songs|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1999-09-17|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Ramblin' Wreck mascot reference was in 1926 to Dean Floyd Field's 1914 [[Ford Model T]].  Sports teams of Georgia Tech are also called the Ramblin' Wreck.
The fight song for Georgia Tech ''[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech|I'm a Rambling Wreck]]'' begins with the lyrics, &quot;I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.&quot;&lt;ref name=RamblinGT&gt;{{cite web|title=I'm A Rambling Wreck&quot; (song lyrics)|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|url=http://www.alumni.gatech.edu/Publications/magazine/win92/ramblin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is sung at sporting events,&lt;ref name=&quot;songs&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2000-08-25/online%20exclusives/11|title=Fight Songs|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2000-08-25|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; official school functions, and always at the end of every graduation ceremony.

=== The Whistle ===
[[Image:Whistle Tech Tower.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Georgia Tech's steam whistle (the grey smoke on the bottom-left) with a fuel burn-off and [[Tech Tower]] in the background.]]
A [[steam whistle]] that blows five minutes before the hour, every hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tech Lingo | publisher = Georgia Institute of Technology | url =http://www.gatech.edu/support/techlingo.html#W |accessdate = 2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is a hold over from the trade school days, originally used to mark the end of a shift in the shops; now it is used both to mark the end of classes and as a ten-minute warning to the beginning of the next classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;webster2004&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nique.net/issues/2004-08-20/freshman%20survival%20guide/8|title=You certainly won’t find these in Webster’s...|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2004-08-20|accessdate=2007-05-20}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also blown when Georgia Tech's football team scores a touchdown or wins a game, and at each spring's &quot;When the Whistle Blows&quot; remembrance ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jody|last=Shaw|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2001-04-20/news/2|title=Whistle blows for fallen Jackets|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2001-04-20|accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webster&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2002-08-23/focus/13 | title = Freshman Survival: You certainly won’t find these in Webster’s... | work = [[The Technique]] | date = 2002-08-23 |accessdate = 2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not as popular as &quot;stealing the T,&quot; the whistle has been stolen several times.  The first ever Tech whistle installed in the late 1890s was stolen in 1902.&lt;ref name=&quot;whistlesteal&quot;&gt;{{cite news
    | title = Students Steal Tech Whistle | last=Green | first=Karl
    | work = The Technique
    | date = 1978-08-25 | accessdate = 2007-10-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The whistle was returned to [[George C. Griffin|Dean Griffin]] in 1949 as a retirement gift.&lt;ref name=&quot;whistlesteal&quot;/&gt;  The second theft of the whistle occurred in 1963, when a group of students nicknamed the &quot;Magnificent 7&quot; stole the whistle.  Fearing Institute repercussions, the group returned the whistle in the spring of 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;whistlesteal&quot;/&gt;  The whistle was again stolen in 1978 by a group nicknamed the &quot;Committee of Five&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Committee of Five Culprits Finally Come Forward |url=http://gtalumnimag.com/2010/04/committee-of-five-culprits-finally-come-forward/|newspaper=Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whistle was also stolen in 1969 and 1997.  Both times the whistle was returned almost immediately after its theft.  In 1969, the whistle was given to the student body president as a graduation gift a month after its theft and the 1997 theft was solved when [[G. Wayne Clough|President Clough]] found the whistle on his lawn a day after its theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/reck/traditionsWhistle.php | title = The Whistle | work = Ramblin' Reck Club Website |accessdate = 2007-10-17 }}  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210154907/http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/reck/traditionsWhistle.php |date=February 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current steam whistle, located near [[Tech Tower]], was built by the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute|GTRI]] Machine Shop and installed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Saulters|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2003-03-21/news/4|title=Aging whistle to be replaced by new design|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2003-03-21|accessdate=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title = New steam whistle is a blast from the past | url = http://www.whistle.gatech.edu/archives/04/may/03/whistle.shtml | first = Lea | last = McLees | work = The Whistle | publisher = Georgia Tech Communications &amp;amp; Marketing |accessdate = 2007-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Smitha|last=Prasadh|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2004-08-20/freshman%20survival%20guide/7|title=New Whistle draws on the past|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2004-08-20|accessdate=2007-05-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty newspaper is also named ''The Whistle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;webster2004&quot;/&gt;

=== To Hell With Georgia ===
{{see also|Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate}}
Georgia Tech has an ongoing rivalry with the [[University of Georgia]], often simply called ''&quot;georgia&quot;'' for short. The rivalry was called [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate]] by Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist and UGA supporter, Lewis Grizzard. An annual issue of the Institute newspaper, ''[[The Technique]]'', focuses on this rivalry with an issue that spoofs ''[[The Red and Black]]'', the newspaper of the University of Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;thwga&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2000-12-01/campus%20life/4|title=Nique staff does Athens in lavish style|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2000-12-01|accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a dig at the rival school, the ''Technique'' will typically refer to it as &quot;the University (sic) of Georgia&quot; (sometimes shortened to &quot;U(sic)GA&quot;) in articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;thwga&quot;/&gt; &quot;[[To Hell With Georgia]]&quot; (abbreviated &quot;THWG&quot; or &quot;THWUGA&quot;or &quot;THWg&quot;) is also known as &quot;The Good Word.&quot; In 2009, the Georgia Tech Cable Network (GTCN),&lt;ref name=&quot;GTCN&quot;&gt;[http://www.gtcn.gatech.edu/ GTCN], Home Page&lt;/ref&gt; produced a show, about the history of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YcIYUvuuo8 'To Hell With Georgia']. If one student asks the word from another (&quot;What's the Good Word?&quot;), the response is always &quot;To Hell with Georgia!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/1999-11-19/campus%20life/5|title=What's the good word?|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1999-11-19|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; If asked about the Bulldogs (&quot;How 'bout them Dawgs?&quot;), an old tagline from the &quot;University of Georgia&quot; expression, the correct answer is, &quot;Piss on 'em!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/tbook/older/traditions/uga.html |title=Traditions: &quot;The Good Word&quot; |work=T-Book |accessdate=2007-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226162655/http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/tbook/older/traditions/uga.html |archivedate=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RAT Caps ===
[[Image:GeorgiaTechRatCapDiagram.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Georgia Tech Rat Cap inscription diagram.]]
Every year, a number of freshmen, most notably those in the [[marching band]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtraditions/traditions/ratcap.html|title=RAT Caps|work=Ramblin' Memories|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-04-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070902131446/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtraditions/traditions/ratcap.html |archivedate = September 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; wear gold caps known as RAT caps at each football game. RAT is short for ''Recruit At Tech'', although recently the Student Government has begun incorrectly using 'Recently Acquired Tech Students' or 'Recently Acquired Techie.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
    | url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2005-08-26/freshman%20survival%20guide/4

    | publisher = Technique
    | date = August 26, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-03-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RAT caps are decorated with the football team's scores, the freshman's name, hometown, major, expected graduation date, and &quot;To HELL With georgia&quot; emblazoned on the back of the cap. It is important that 'HELL' should be in all capital letters, while 'georgia' should be all lowercase. Students who intend to utilize the [[cooperative education]] program circle the top button on the cap, and fill it in once they have completed their involvement.

The tradition began in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|title=Traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and freshmen were required to wear the RAT caps every day until the Thanksgiving weekend game with UGA (if Georgia Tech won) or until end of the school year (if Georgia Tech lost).&lt;ref name=&quot;season&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/reck/about.php?PHPSESSID=413fd85976060e885c577f3391796e6f|title=What is the Ramblin' Reck Club?|publisher=Ramblin' Reck Club|accessdate=2007-04-10|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070214005619/http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/reck/about.php?PHPSESSID=01be48a58d45a4c3a99687f31d0f969b &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2007-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Tech did not play UGA that year, freshmen were allowed to stop wearing their caps after a homecoming game victory. If the team lost, then the previously stated rules applied. Freshmen caught not wearing the cap faced varying degrees of [[hazing]],&lt;ref name=&quot;season&quot;/&gt; including having their hair shaved into the shape of a letter tee (&quot;T&quot;) or a T-Cut. Anti-hazing laws in the 1960s led to the virtual elimination of the tradition,&lt;ref name=&quot;ens&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- p345 --&gt; although the use of RAT caps is still actively maintained by the marching band.

The RAT rules enforced by upperclassmen and in particular the Ramblin' Reck Club are presented in the July 17, 1964 edition of the ''Technique''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Junior's Grill ===
{{main|Junior's Grill}}
[[Image:Junior's Grill.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Junior's Grill]], on the side of [[Tech Tower]]]]
Junior's Grill was a restaurant located in East Campus next to [[Tech Tower]]. The restaurant was first opened in 1948 under the name Pilgrim's and was originally located on the corner of [[North Avenue (Atlanta)|North Avenue]] and Techwood Drive. Its name changed to Junior's Grill in 1958, and it moved locations twice since then.  Junior's Grill moved to its former location in the Bradley Building in 1994 when it was forced out of its old location by the need to construct apartments for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Junior's Tradition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://juniors.gatech.edu/history.php |title=The Junior's Tradition |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714034831/http://www.juniors.gatech.edu/history.php |archivedate=July 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was owned and operated by Tommy Klemis, a Tech 'EE grad.&lt;ref name=&quot;jun&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Joshua|last=Cuneo|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2004-08-27/focus/1|title=Junior’s struggles to match competition|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2004-08-27|accessdate=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former restaurant housed pieces of Tech history, including aerial photographs of campus from various years, assorted Georgia Tech memorabilia, portraits of prominent individuals in Tech's history, and a section of the goalpost from Tech's [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|1990 National Championship]] game in the [[Citrus Bowl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Junior's Tradition&quot;/&gt;
Junior's Grill closed April 2011, citing slow business as the reason.

Georgia Tech [[Homecoming]] is a celebration held once a year for [[alumnus|alum]] of the Institute to return to campus and take part in several festivities and Institute traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;alumnihome&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtalumni.org/site/Page/Homecoming|title=Georgia Tech Homecoming|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;homeweb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/homecoming/|title=Georgia Tech Homecoming Website|publisher=Georgia Tech|accessdate=2007-05-15|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070513150150/http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/homecoming/ |archivedate = May 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The themed homecoming festivities all lead up to a Saturday football contest. The events are usually lead off with various Greek sports tournaments followed by the Mini 500, Freshman Cake Race, and the Wreck Parade.  Every year the student body elects a Mr. and Ms. Georgia Tech. These are two individuals who have excelled in academics and extracurriculars on Tech campus. The titles changed from homecoming king and queen to Mr. and Ms. Georgia Tech in 1987 at the request of Dean [[James E. Dull]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dull&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==== Mini 500 ====
{{see also|Mini 500}}
The Mini 500 is a [[tricycle]] race held during homecoming every year that requires teams to complete laps around Peters Parking Deck on East Campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;tric&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Madhu|last=Adiga|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2002-10-25/news/2|title=Fun, rule changes mark homecoming events|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2002-10-25|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/help/tech-lingo.php |title=Tech Lingo |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317210945/http://www.gatech.edu/help/tech-lingo.php |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Men must complete 15 laps, while women must complete 10. There are mandatory pit stops in which the front tire must be rotated 3 times during the course of the race. Because the average racer weighs more than the average 5-year-old, the car is allowed one support brace to be welded onto the frame.

The race traces its roots back to the early 1960s, when fraternity pledges were forced to ride tricycles around campus as a form of hazing.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/1999-10-08/campus%20life/7|title=Homecoming traditions make Tech special|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1999-10-08|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race was eventually formalized in 1969, and rules were instituted to make the Mini 500 an instant classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==== Wreck Parade ====
The Ramblin' Wreck Parade is a parade of classic cars and engineering oddities held before every homecoming football game. There are three classes of vehicles, which participate in the competition. The first class is known simply as classic cars and these are vehicles over a certain age limit (currently 25 years). The second class is known as fixed bodies and these vehicles are normal cars, which have only been cosmetically modified retaining their original [[drive train]]. These are often themed, but are distinctly different from [[Float (parade)|floats]] and are prohibited from being &quot;pseudo-wrecks displaying pomps&quot;. The third class is the contraption category and these vehicles feature drive trains completely fabricated by students ranging from [[pendulum]] propulsion to [[pulse jet]] engines. Vehicles must feature an &quot;indirect&quot; drive system and are judged both on creativity and effective operation.

The Wreck parade dates back to 1929 when ''[[The Technique]]'' began an &quot;Old Ford Race&quot; to Athens.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;/&gt; In 1932, the race was deemed unsafe by the administration so a parade of contraptions was created to subdue student protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;/&gt;  The parade has run every year since 1932 except for the years of 1942-1943.  The American fuel shortage caused by [[World War II]] stopped the parade.  In 1944, the parade was renewed except the contraptions had to be [[Human-powered transport|human powered]].  [[Internal combustion engine|Gasoline power]] was allowed again in 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;fuelshortage&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary |last=Goettling |url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/spr95/ww2.html |title=World War II and the Tech Connection |work=Tech Topics |date=Spring 1995 |accessdate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223174049/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/spr95/ww2.html |archivedate=December 23, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Freshman Cake Race ====
The Freshman Cake Race is a foot race from the [[Russ Chandler Stadium]] to [[Bobby Dodd Stadium]] that takes place before sunrise (about 6:00 am) on the morning of the homecoming game. This distance is about a one-half mile, so the crowd of several hundred participants engages in a mad sprint over the relatively short distance. The race runs through the middle of the campus's Greek sector and is often subject to tampering by fraternity students. The competitors are supposed to be freshmen (students with less than 30 hours of credit), and the race is split up by gender. The winners receive cakes baked by faculty, alumni, or students, and all participants receive cupcakes. The winners also receive a kiss from Mr. or Ms. Georgia Tech at the homecoming half-time show.

The race began as a cross-country race in 1911. In 1913, the winners received cakes from wives, mothers, and other women affiliated with Tech. The race was initially mandatory for all students.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cake race&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtraditions/traditions/cakerace.html|title=Freshman Cake Race|work=Tech Traditions|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-03-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070903213602/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtraditions/traditions/cakerace.html |archivedate = September 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1910s&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1910s.html|title=Tech Timeline: 1910s|work=Tech Traditions|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-03-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016201916/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1910s.html |archivedate = October 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirit Organizations ===

==== Ramblin' Reck Club ====
The Ramblin' Reck Club was founded in 1930 as the Yellow Jacket Club to help bolster school spirit.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1930s&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1930s.html |title=Tech Timeline: 1930s |work=Tech Traditions |publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203134351/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1930s.html |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coach [[William Alexander (coach)|William Alexander]] found campus spirit to be particularly low during the [[Great Depression]]. His successful football program and the other athletic teams had very few student fans attending the games. In 1930, Alexander approached Professor Fred Wenn about organizing and founding such a club, who agreed to take up the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/reck/about.php|title=What is the Ramblin' Reck Club?|work=Ramblin' Reck Club|accessdate=2007-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210155020/http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/reck/about.php |archivedate = 2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yellow Jacket Club helped facilitate the Freshman Cake Race and helped to organize the first Wreck Parades in 1932.  The Yellow Jacket Club were the strict student enforcement of the freshmen RAT rules as well.  The Yellow Jacket Club maintained prestige and political power on campus until late 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

When new freshmen arrived on campus in 1945, the student body was concerned that traditions would be lost with the disbandment of the Yellow Jackets.&lt;ref name=&quot;dead&quot;/&gt; A new traditions club was actively pursued by Anak to instill the rich Tech tradition into new freshmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;dead&quot;/&gt;  The new club was the Ramblin' Reck Club and it was established in late July 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;newrecks&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first order of business for the new Ramblin' Reck Club was to stage a Pep Meeting and traditions review for new freshmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;newrecks&quot;/&gt;  Reck Club was designed to prevent political domination by individual social fraternities as Yellow Jacket Club had been.  Membership in Reck Club was limited to two individuals per fraternity or military ROTC program.&lt;ref name=&quot;newrecks&quot;/&gt;  A group known as the T-Club was charged with upholding the RAT rules with incoming freshmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;newrecks&quot;/&gt;

Four years after Tech became coed, Reck Club became the first non-[[faith based]] organization on campus to admit a female member.&lt;ref name=&quot;reck club&quot;/&gt;  Paula Stevenson was the club's first female member in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;reck club&quot;/&gt;  Under Reck Club, the strict RAT rules slowly faded away. Anti-hazing laws severely diminished Reck Club's ability to punish Tech freshmen for disobeying the RAT rules in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;reck club&quot;/&gt;  By 1967, the Club was given a more wholesome duty.

Reck Club was given charge of the Ramblin' Wreck in 1967 following the disbandment of the Student Council's Reck Committee.  A member from Reck Club known as the Wreck Driver has been elected annually since 1967 to drive the Wreck onto Grant Field for football games and other school functions.

Reck Club was the first group to make attempts at humanoid mascots on Tech Campus.  The first was a [[bee]] costume donned by Judi McNair of Reck Club.&lt;ref name=&quot;judi&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Cam|last=McNair|url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/dspace/bitstream/1853/10619/5/TT%202004%20Winter%20NoAds%20LoRes.pdf|page=4|title=Give My Wife Some Credit|work=Tech Topics|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|date=Winter 2004|accessdate=2007-05-20|format=PDF|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060913232213/http://smartech.gatech.edu/dspace/bitstream/1853/10619/5/TT%202004%20Winter%20NoAds%20LoRes.pdf |archivedate = September 13, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She sported her bee costume to home basketball games and pep rallies. In 1973, a [[spandex]]-clad hero named T-Man and his faithful sidekick T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; patrolled campus in search of opposing mascots and fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;blueprintrrc74&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

The Ramblin' Reck Club today oversees several homecoming traditions such as the Freshman Cake Race, the Mini 500, and the Wreck Parade.&lt;ref name=&quot;reck club&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reckclub.org|title=Ramblin' Reck Club|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://technique.library.gatech.edu/issues/spring1998/apr17/campuslife5.html|title=Ramblins: The Ramblin' Reck Club's about as old as it gets|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1998-04-17|accessdate=2007-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reck Club also serves as a bridge between Georgia Tech Athletics and the Georgia Tech student body organizing the Swarm cheering section, pep rallies, flashcards sections, and other spirit related events.

==== Bull Dog Club ====
The Bull Dog Club was an honor society created in 1910 originally as a social branch of Tech's Koseme Society.&lt;ref name=&quot;blueprintbdc10&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal
  | title = [[Blueprint (yearbook)|The Blueprint]], 1910 Bull Dog Club
  | pages =
  | year = 1911
  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bull Dogs first major role was facilitating the first cross country races that eventually evolved into the Freshman Cake Race.  The Bull Dogs only admitted rising juniors and seniors into their ranks in order to maintain prestige and honor in the club.

The Bull Dogs rise to Institute prominence also lead to their eventual demise.  The Bull Dogs put a particular emphasis on mediating campus-wide sporting events.  The Bull Dogs utilized their Cake Race ties to the Athletic Association in order to coordinate the first intramurals on the athletic playing fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulldog69&quot;/&gt;

The Bull Dogs also aided in spirit and tradition upkeep on campus by aiding in Ramblin' Wreck Parade judging, homecoming queen selection, and homecoming dance planning.&lt;ref name=&quot;bulldog69&quot;/&gt; Despite the Bull Dogs roles in homecoming celebrations, their intramural coordination became their primary focus by the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Georgia Tech Bands ====
{{main|Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket Marching Band}}
The Georgia Tech Bands are student musical groups fielded at many of the home athletic and schoolwide events.  None of the musicians receive scholarships for participating in the assorted bands meaning the bands are composed entirely of volunteers.  

Every home football game and most away games include a 300 member Georgia Tech marching band performing during [[Dead ball (American football)|dead ball time]] and [[half-time]].  The GT Bands also field smaller pep bands at home [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], and [[volleyball]] games.  The bands are known to follow teams for special events such as [[bowl games]] and [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|basketball tournaments]].  The ice hockey pep band in particular travels to [[Savannah, GA|Savannah]] every year for the Thrasher cup.  The band has some of the richest traditions on campus, including a strict enforcement of RAT caps amongst first year band members, no matter their actual year in college.&lt;ref name=&quot;bands&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtband.net/mambo/|title=Georgia Tech Bands|accessdate=2007-03-23|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070216063623/http://www.gtband.net/mambo/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Georgia Tech bands were formed in 1908 and led by Robert &quot;Biddy&quot; Bidez.  Bidez lead the group until his graduation in 1912.  He was succeeded by another student named Mike Greenblatt who continued in Bidez's footsteps until 1913.  Greenblatt wrote the first versions of &quot;Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech&quot;.  The first professional band director was Frank &quot;Wop&quot; Roman.  Roman is noted for writing Tech's Alma Mater as well as &quot;Up With the White and Gold&quot;.  Roman copyrighted &quot;Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech&quot; in 1919 and led the bands until his death in 1928.  Since Roman there have been seven professional band directors.  The directors have had varying levels of success and longevity.

==== Swarm ====
The Swarm is a spirit group&lt;ref name=&quot;season&quot;/&gt; consisting of 900 Georgia Tech students found seated along the north end zone during home football games and on the court during basketball games.  The Swarm was started by the Suzanne &quot;Suzy Swarm&quot; Robinson of the  Ramblin' Reck Club in 1996 to increase the amount of student participation in the stands.&lt;ref name=&quot;swarm1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Cunningham | url = http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2001-10-12/sports/2 | title = Techsters swarm to join student-run cheering squad | work = [[The Technique]] | date = 2001-10-12 | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swarm was only 250 members when it began in 1996.  The group increased to 650 members by 2001 and is currently 900 members strong.&lt;ref name=&quot;swarm1&quot;/&gt;  All Swarm members donate to the Alexander-Tharpe fund and are given gold t-shirts before every football and basketball season.&lt;ref name=&quot;swarm&quot;&gt;{{cite web

    | title = Swarm: Student Members of Alexander-Tharpe Fund | accessdate = February 14, 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the more popular traditions amongst Swarm members is the &quot;Running of the Swarm.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;swarm1&quot;/&gt;  Because all Swarm seating is general admission, there are no reserved seats.  The Swarm members must run once the gate is opened to get the best seats.

==== Flashcards ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:GTflashcards79.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Georgia Tech Flashcard Section in 1979.{{puic|1=GTflashcards79.jpg|log=2009 May 16}}]] --&gt;
A flashcard display is performed at every home football game by students. The flashcard section was first formed in 1957 by an organization known as the Block-T Club.  The idea for a flashcard section and group to organize its efforts was conceived by members of the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity.  Through the support of Ramblin' Reck Club the first flashcard section featured 400 freshmen and highly coordinated flashcard images.&lt;ref name=&quot;blueprint58&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Goldfellas ====
The Goldfellas are a group of Georgia Tech [[superfans]] that paint their entire bodies yellow spelling out witty phrases in black letters on their chest.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldf&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- url was http://www.ajc.com/search/content/sports/gatech/stories/2007/11/25/techscene_1125.html --&gt;{{cite news| title = Tech fans make the best of another loss| author = Stinson, Thomas| accessdate = 2007-11-25| date = 2007-11-25|work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These painted fans attend every home football game and are located behind the South end zone goalpost.  Occasionally, the Goldfellas will attend home basketball, volleyball, or other sporting events. The group had its origins in the 1998 Georgia Tech football season, when a group of guys painted up for the homecoming game against the favored Virginia Cavaliers, the second of the fabled [[41-38]] games. The Jackets upset the Cavaliers and the tradition was started and passed on by residents in the now defunct Area II dormitories.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldf&quot;/&gt; Each member is given a unique face design that is retired upon his graduation. The group is not considered an official club as its members do not bow to any charters and are not affiliated with Swarm.  The Goldfellas take pride in their complete lack of clothing besides a yellow wig and gym shorts.  The group never sits during the course of a football game, not even during halftime. The largest gathering of the Goldfellas occurred in the 2007 football game against rival University of Georgia with over 80 Tech students painted up with the Goldfellas for the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldf&quot;/&gt;

==== Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech ====
{{main|Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech}}
''I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech'' is Georgia Tech's [[fight song]]. The composition is based on ''Son of a Gambolier'' by [[Charles Ives]] (1895), and the lyrics are based on an old English and Scottish [[drinking song]] of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;music&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coa.gatech.edu/music/friends/history.php |title=Department History |work=Music Department |publisher=Georgia Tech College of Architecture |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403060407/http://www.coa.gatech.edu/music/friends/history.php |archivedate=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiSONGAMB;ttSONGAMB.html|title=The Son of a Gambolier|publisher=Digital Tradition Mirror|accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia Tech Traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-02-12|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ramblin' Wreck'' is played after every Georgia Tech score (directly after a field goal/safety and preceded by ''[[Up With the White and Gold]]'' after a touchdown) in a [[American football|football]] game, and frequently during timeouts at basketball games.&lt;ref name=&quot;songs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://technique.library.gatech.edu/issues/fall1995/oct20/campus5-s.html|title=Ramlin's|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1995-10-02|accessdate=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Rottmann|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2002-09-06/entertainment/3|title=New NCAA Football raises bar|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2002-09-06|accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to the [[Ramblin' Wreck]], one of Tech's mascots and a nickname for Tech students.

Oh, sons of Tech, arise, behold!&lt;br /&gt;
The banner as it reigns supreme,&lt;br /&gt;
For from on high the White and Gold&lt;br /&gt;
Waves in its triumphant gleam.&lt;br /&gt;
The spirit of the cheering throng&lt;br /&gt;

A brotherhood in praise and song,&lt;br /&gt;
In memory of the days gone by.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, [[Kinship and descent|Scion]] of the [[Deep South|Southland]]!&lt;br /&gt;
In our hearts you shall forever fly.

We cherish thoughts so dear for thee,&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, [[Alma Mater]], in our prayer.&lt;br /&gt;
We plead for you in victory,&lt;br /&gt;
And in the victory we share!&lt;br /&gt;
But when the battle seems in vain&lt;br /&gt;
Our spirits never falter,&lt;br /&gt;
We're ever one in joy or pain,&lt;br /&gt;
And our union is a lasting bond.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh! May we be united.&lt;br /&gt;
Till the victory of life is won.

==== Budweiser Song ====
{{main|Here Comes the King}}
At every football game and every home basketball game, the fans of Georgia Tech perform an unusual dance at the end of the 3rd quarter in football and during the second to last television timeout of basketball.&lt;ref name=&quot;bud&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harmony.gatech.edu/tubas/traditions/|title=Georgia Tech Tubas DAMMITT!!: Bud|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance is a simple bobbing motion which alternates every other person (simulating the up-and-down motion of the heads of the familiar team of [[Clydesdale]] horses) and is performed to the tune of an old [[Here Comes the King|Budweiser jingle]].  The Georgia Tech additional lyrics are as follows:
:''Go Georgia Tech!''
:''Go Georgia Tech!''
:''Go Georgia Tech!''
:''Go Georgia Tech!''
:''When you say Bud...weiser, you've said it all!''

The term Yellow Jacket or Yellowjacket has been used to refer to students and the various sports teams as early as the 1890s.  Fans of Georgia Tech would often wear yellow jackets to sporting events in support of the early Georgia Tech teams.  The early football teams, lacking gold fabric for jerseys, wore [[yellow]] jerseys. John Heisman told the [[Atlanta Constitution]] that he wanted his teams to be referred to as the Yellow Jackets in October 1905.  In November 1906, the [[Atlanta Journal]] portrayed a [[University of Georgia]] [[American football|football]] player being attacked by a [[yellowjacket]] with the words &quot;Somebody's going to get stung&quot; as the caption.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title = First Yellowjacket Image in AJC | url = http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/fall06/InFocusImg1.html| date = Fall-06 | accessdate = 2007-05-29 | last = | first = | work = Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine }}{{Dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would be the first time and not the last time that the Georgia Tech sports teams would be referred to as the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yellow Jackets Fly By 100-year Mark |url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/fall06/InFocus.html |date=Fall-06 |accessdate=2007-05-29 |last= |first= |work=Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020185000/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/fall06/InFocus.html |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzz Bee became the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] Yellow Jacket in 1979.  He was initially an impromptu student volunteer but is now an official cheerleader that requires an intense tryout process.  This Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Walk Through Tech's History |url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/sum04/article1.html |date=Summer-04 |accessdate=2007-05-29 |last= |first= |work=Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524115055/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/sum04/article1.html |archivedate=May 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== George P. Burdell ===
{{main|George P. Burdell}}
The legendary imaginary Tech student [[George P. Burdell]] who enrolled in 1927&lt;ref name=&quot;tbbd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbook.org/index.php?id=2|title=The TBook: George P.

In 1927, a student, receiving 2 enrollment forms, also enrolled as ''George P. Burdell'' and attended as both names, so Burdell obtained a B.S. 1930, got a Master's, and in [[World War II]], went to [[Harvard]] and joined the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tbbd&quot;/&gt; Since the 1960s, some students have managed to re-enroll George P. Burdell in the Institute registrar's computers. When Tech switched to online class registration, Burdell took every course offered that term.&lt;ref name=&quot;tbbd&quot;/&gt; After initially vigorously searching for the [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], the Institute has since accepted the presence of George P. Burdell in every year's class. George P. Burdell is also a common tool for pranks at various school events and games. He usually gets paged over the stadium public address system at away sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | work = [[The Technique]] | date = 2006-08-25 | accessdate = 2007-02-04 | title = George P.

=== The Cumberland Game ===
[[Image:GT Cumberland 222 scoreboard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The scoreboard, displaying the largest margin of victory in football history.]]
{{main|1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game}}
In 1916, Georgia Tech's football team (coached by [[John Heisman]]—for whom the [[Heisman Trophy|trophy]] is named) defeated Cumberland 222-0, the largest margin of victory in college football history.&lt;ref name=&quot;story222&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cumberland.edu/about/gotc/gamestory.html |title=222-0: The Story of The Game of the Century |first=G.

Cumberland did not record a first down. Georgia Tech scored every time it got the ball;&lt;ref name=&quot;story222&quot;/&gt; although one page on Cumberland's web site says that Georgia Tech scored on every offensive play, the play-by-play posted on its site indicates otherwise.&lt;ref name=&quot;story222&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cumberland.edu/about/gotc/pbp.html |title=PLAY-BY-PLAY: GEORGIA TECH 222, CUMBERLAND 0 |date=1916-10-07 |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212192433/http://www.cumberland.edu/about/gotc/pbp.html |archivedate=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland beat Georgia Tech's baseball team 22 to 0 the previous year, reportedly with the help of professional players Cumberland had hired as &quot;ringers,&quot; an act which apparently infuriated Heisman.&lt;ref name=&quot;story222&quot;/&gt;

=== 41–38 ===
{{see also|1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|Toe meets leather}}
41–38 is the score of two victories by Georgia Tech over [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia]] in [[college football]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uva&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry|last=Memberg|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/1999-07-09/sports/1|title='99 Jackets look to top last year's madness|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1999-07-09|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toe meets leather|In 1990]], Virginia won its first seven games and raced out to a #1 ranking in both polls. Undefeated but unheralded Georgia Tech came into [[Scott Stadium]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and beat the Cavaliers 41–38 on a last-second field goal by Scott Sisson.&lt;ref name=&quot;uva&quot;/&gt; This victory set off celebrations back in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] that culminated in GT students breaking into [[Bobby Dodd Stadium]], closed for the road game that weekend, and tearing down a goalpost (a common victory celebration when a game is played ''on one's home field''). GT went on to be ACC champion and co-national champion with [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]] that season, which included Colorado's [[Fifth Down Game (1990)|Fifth Down Game]] against [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]]. Virginia's season spiraled downhill from there, going 1–3 to finish 8–4 and ranked only #22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brett |last=Jerasa |url=http://www.cavalierdaily.com/news/2002/oct/25/eyeing-a-bowl-bid-cavs-face-jackets/ |title=Eyeing a bowl bid, Cavs face Jackets |work=[[The Cavalier Daily]] |date=2002-10-25 |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521194956/http://www.cavalierdaily.com/news/2002/oct/25/eyeing-a-bowl-bid-cavs-face-jackets/ |archivedate=May 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the first year since 1990 that both teams had come into this game with high hopes, #25 GT hosted undefeated #7 UVA, and again pulled off the upset. This time, the Jackets came from three touchdowns behind and survived a 54-yard field goal miss by UVA kicker Todd Braverman as time ran out.&lt;ref name=&quot;uva&quot;/&gt; Since then, any time the two teams have met with rankings and bowl positions on the line, GT fans have used &quot;41–38&quot; as a rallying cry, similar to [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] fans' &quot;[[Wide Right (Florida State)|Wide Right]]&quot; against [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/journal/2005/11/11/41-38/|title=41-38|work=Writings from the Dirt Road|date=2005-11-11|accessdate=2007-03-23|quote=Say &quot;41-38″ to any Georgia Tech fan and they will know exactly what opponent you are talking about.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sideways the Dog ===
[[Image:SidewaysHeadstone.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Headstone of Sideways the Dog (2007)]]
Sideways (March 1, 1945 – August 14, 1947) was a black and white female [[terrier]] who was thrown from a car near the Georgia Tech campus. Her injuries left the front and rear portions of her body out of alignment with each other and caused her to walk with an off-center gait, leading to her nickname.&lt;ref name=&quot;side&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|url=http://technique.library.gatech.edu/issues/winter1998/jan23/campuslife4.html|last=Edwards|title=Ramblins - Stumpy's bear, Sideways the dog remembered in Tech history|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1998-01-23|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a favorite of the students, and often slept in a different dorm room every night, being fed through the generosity of the student body and Brittain Dining Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;side&quot;/&gt; She would often wander into classes and sleep during boring lectures.

Sideways died after accidentally ingesting some rat poison in one of the dorm rooms, and is buried on the grounds near the southeast corner of [[Tech Tower]].&lt;ref name=&quot;side&quot;/&gt; A plaque marks her resting spot and briefly tells her story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtraditions/legends/sideways.html|title=Sideways the Dog|work=Tech Traditions|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-03-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070902132042/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtraditions/legends/sideways.html |archivedate = September 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reads, &quot;Sideways. Ever faithful and true. Companion of student body of Ga. Tech.&quot;

The headstone was recently rotated 90 degrees clockwise from what is shown in the picture at right so that Sideways may be in death as she was in life.

=== Stumpy's bear ===
After defeating the [[California Golden Bears]] in the [[Roy Riegels|1929 Rose Bowl Game]], Tech [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] Jack &quot;Stumpy&quot; Thomason acquired a live bear while in [[California]].  He brought the bear back to Tech and raised the bear in Atlanta.&lt;ref name=&quot;side&quot;/&gt;  Named Bruin, the bear made a habit of [[alcoholism|drinking too much]] beer and rummaging through Midtown Atlanta dumpsters.&lt;ref name=&quot;side&quot;/&gt;  After a lot of Atlantan complaints and two arrests by local police, Stumpy agreed to cage Bruin in Bobby Dodd Stadium.  Bruin left Tech campus with Stumpy when Stumpy was acquired by the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;stumpystats&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=|url=http://www.jt-sw.com/football/pro/players.nsf/ID/01180028|last=|title=Stumpy Thomason Career Statistics|work=Football @ JT-SW.com|accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drownproofing ===
{{main|Drownproofing}}
From 1940 to 1987, Tech offered a class called Drownproofing,&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1940s&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1940s.html |title=Tech Timeline: 1940s |work=Tech Traditions |publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203130638/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1940s.html |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was required for graduation for students. The class was developed by Coach Fred Lanoue for the Naval School, which was located at Georgia Tech before and during [[World War II]]. He taught students how to float in water for extended periods of time with ankles and wrists bound, how (unbound) to swim 50 yards (46 m) underwater, and other water survival skills. At the time it was considered a prime example of the difficulty of Tech's curriculum, and referred to in jest by students as &quot;Drowning 101.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/sum00/firstperson.html |title=Drownproofing |last=Apostolu |first=Dan |publisher=Tech Topics |date=Summer 2000 |accessdate=2006-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225102611/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/techtopics/sum00/firstperson.html |archivedate=February 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Bayor |author3=James E. Brittain |author4=Lawrence Foster |author5=August W. Giebelhaus |author6=Germaine M. Reed |title=Engineering the New South: Georgia Tech 1885-1985|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|location=Athens, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- p355 --&gt; The name stems from the fact that the campus is bordered to the south by [[North Avenue (Atlanta)|North Avenue]], and that the school in its earlier years was operated much like a [[trade school]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins&quot;/&gt; with students working part of the day in a machine shop, and the other part of the day in classrooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopkins&quot;/&gt; Today the name is still used in a [[in-joke|humorous]] manner: the campus bookstore even sells shirts bearing the name &quot;North Avenue Trade School.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatech.bkstore.com/default.asp?m=0303&amp;p=52579&amp;cat_id=5|title=Barnes &amp; Noble @ Georgia Tech: &quot;North Avenue Trade School&quot; T-shirt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Institute ===
Traditionally, Georgia Tech has been called &quot;the Institute&quot; while discouraging the nicknames &quot;the university&quot; or &quot;the college&quot;.  The Institute had been divided into &quot;Schools&quot; which are now called &quot;Colleges&quot; for each field of study. When Georgia Tech's football team played the University of Miami for its 2006 Homecoming game, several students were seen wearing gold t-shirts that said, &quot;Screw the U, Fear the I!&quot; (mocking Miami's tradition of being called the U).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtsports.blogspot.com/2006/11/fear-i.html|publisher=Georgia Tech Sports Blog|title=Fear the I|accessdate=2007-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=2644402|title=The Dash breaks out the Adriana rating system|date=2006-11-13|first=Pat|last=Forde|accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of only five [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Bowl Subdivision]] football programs without &quot;University&quot; in the school's name. The others are [[Boston College]] and the three service academies ([[United States Air Force Academy]], [[United States Military Academy]] and the [[United States Naval Academy]]).

=== Getting Shafted ===
&quot;Getting shafted&quot; generally refers to the rigorous academic difficulty of Georgia Tech's curriculum.&lt;ref name=&quot;webster2004&quot;/&gt; The physical manifestation of this phrase is the [[Kessler Campanile]], a &quot;shaft-like&quot; structure near the Student Center. The phallic shape of the structure invites its designation as a shafting device.&lt;ref name=&quot;webster2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nargon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tech Dictionary |publisher=North Avenue Review |url=http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/nar/summer98/fresh/dictionary.html |accessdate=2007-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902045303/http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/nar/summer98/fresh/dictionary.html |archivedate=September 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Ratio ===
The Ratio (always capitalized) refers to Georgia Tech's traditionally high ratio of male to female students.

=== TBS ===
Due to the Ratio (always capitalized, see above), some students have felt that certain women at Georgia Tech may be stuck up because of all the attention they get from an overwhelming number of males. These students call the behavior of the female in this scenario as &quot;Tech Bitch Syndrome&quot; or &quot;TBS&quot; for short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aileen|last=Li|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2007-03-09/focus/3|title=Women speak on campus experience|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2007-03-09|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Madhu|last=Adiga|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2002-06-14/opinions/4|title=Staff Editorial: Advice for males from a Tech female: there is no TBS|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2002-06-14|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brinda|last=Ramaiya|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2000-03-17/news/1|title=Women’s awareness month kicks off|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2000-03-17|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2000-03-31/news/7|title=Scientists isolate bacteria that causes TBS|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2000-03-31|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Allison|last=Roberts|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/1999-04-16/opinions/5|title=Tech females should resist ratio stereotypes|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1999-04-16|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Miklos|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/1999-09-17/opinions/6|title=Tech girls give Tech guys shaft in whole new way|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1999-09-17|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women against the term claim that they are often labeled the term without warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tech Dictionary |publisher=North Avenue Review |url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/nar/summer98/fresh/tbs.html |date=Summer 1998 |accessdate=2007-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902044945/http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/nar/summer98/fresh/tbs.html |archivedate=September 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the term was done by Georgia Tech's Sexual Violence and Prevention Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why is VOICE at Tech?|publisher=VOICE|url=http://www.voice.gatech.edu/site_content/2_For_Men/1_Why_We_Are_Here/page_3.php|accessdate=2007-05-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520140858/http://www.voice.gatech.edu/site_content/2_For_Men/1_Why_We_Are_Here/page_3.php |archivedate = May 20, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Getting Out ===
&quot;Getting out&quot; refers to graduating from Georgia Tech. Graduates typically say &quot;I got out&quot; rather than that they graduated from Georgia Tech.&lt;ref name=&quot;webster2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave|last=McGill|url=http://www.gtalumni.org/news/ttopics/fall96/out.html|title=&quot;Getting Out&quot; the Hard Way|work=Tech Topics|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|date=Fall 1996|accessdate=2007-03-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050223152414/http://gtalumni.org/news/ttopics/fall96/out.html |archivedate = February 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Two Bits Man|authorlink=Two Bits Man|url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2007-08-24/entertainment/4|title=Two Bits Man welcomes new RATS to Tech campus|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2007-08-24|accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ma Tech ===
An affectionate name used by students and alumni for their Alma Mater.&lt;ref name=&quot;season&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webster2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/mecheng/profiles/mcgoff.htm|title=Matthew McGoff|publisher=The Sloan Career Cornerstone Center|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Hill ===
A nickname given to Tech's academic administration and [[Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District|historic district]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Historic District&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topographically, Tech's first administrative buildings were built on an actual hill in Atlanta. As campus expanded onto surrounding lower terrain, the Hill became a much more prominent sight on campus. The term now is typically used in derision when referring to the administration. Former Tech Interim President [[Gary Schuster]]'s blog, titled, &quot;Notes from the Hill&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/blogs/president/ |title=Notes from the Hill |last=Schuster |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Schuster |publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211194233/http://www.gatech.edu/blogs/president/? |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to this nickname.

The Hill also refers to the steep incline of Bobby Dodd Way (which most students now refer to as &quot;Freshman Hill&quot;), which residents of East Campus must trek up in order to attend class.  The climb is often referred to as a hike up the Freshman Hill as many freshman dorms are located around the bottom of Freshman Hill.
