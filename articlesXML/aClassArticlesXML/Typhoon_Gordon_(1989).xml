'''Typhoon Gordon''', known in the Philippines as '''Typhoon Goring''', was a powerful [[tropical cyclone]] that caused widespread damage and loss of life in the Philippines and [[Southern China]] in July 1989. Originating from a single [[cumulonimbus cloud]] on July&amp;nbsp;9, Gordon developed into a tropical depression near the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and quickly intensified as it tracked west-southwestward. On July&amp;nbsp;13, the storm attained typhoon status and subsequently underwent a period of [[Rapid deepening|rapid intensification]]. By July&amp;nbsp;15, the storm attained its peak strength as a [[SSHS#Category 5|Category&amp;nbsp;5 equivalent]] super typhoon with winds estimated at 260&amp;nbsp;km/h (160&amp;nbsp;mph). After striking the northern Philippines, Gordon moved through the [[South China Sea]] and slowly weakened. On July&amp;nbsp;18, the storm made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in southern [[China]] and was last noted the following day as it dissipated over land.

Throughout Gordon's path from the Philippines to China, the storm caused widespread damage and loss of life. Across the Philippines, 90 people were killed by the typhoon and an estimated 120,000 people were left homeless. Though a weaker storm when it struck China, damage was more severe due to extensive flooding. Several coastal cities were completely inundated. Throughout the country, at least 200 people died and losses reached 1.2&amp;nbsp;billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] ($319&amp;nbsp;million [[United States dollar|USD]]).{{#tag:ref|All monetary values are in 1989&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], [[Philippine peso]]s, or [[Chinese Yuan]]|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Additionally, 14 people drowned offshore and 2 others died in [[Hong Kong]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Gordon 1989 track.png}}
In early July, widespread [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]] developed across the Western Pacific underneath a [[tropical upper tropospheric trough|tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT)]]. On July&amp;nbsp;9, a single [[cumulonimbus cloud]] west of [[Wake Island]] became associated with the TUTT and quickly organized. By July&amp;nbsp;11, the system featured a small [[central dense overcast]] and soon became sufficiently organized for the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)]] to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W.{{#tag:ref|The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] is a joint [[United States Navy]] &amp;ndash; [[United States Air Force]] task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the western Pacific Ocean and other regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Center |publisher=United States Navy |title=Joint Typhoon Warning Center Mission Statement |year=2011 |accessdate=January 7, 2012 |url=https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/menu/JTWC_mission.html |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726103400/https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/menu/JTWC_mission.html |archivedate=July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320&amp;nbsp;km (200&amp;nbsp;mi) east of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a [[tropical cyclone]]; and second, it became tropical while situated underneath a [[cold-core low]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ATCR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=1st Lt. Robert J. Falvey|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy|year=1990|accessdate=March 27, 2012|title=1989 Annual Tropical Cyclone Report: Typhoon Gordon (08W)|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1989atcr.pdf|format=PDF|pages=64â€“68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the system's classification as a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained a west-southwesterly track in response to a [[subtropical ridge]] to the north. On July&amp;nbsp;12, it is estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name ''Gordon'' by the JTWC.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATCR&quot;/&gt; Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name ''Goring''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDCC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseportal.com/cgi-bin/baseportal.pl?htx=/miso/typhoons&amp;range=100,20|title=Destructive Typhoons 1970-2003|date=November 9, 2004|publisher=National Disaster Coordinating Council|accessdate=March 27, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041109182017/http://baseportal.com/cgi-bin/baseportal.pl?htx=/miso/typhoons&amp;range=100,20 |archivedate=November 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the afternoon of July&amp;nbsp;13, Gordon briefly turned southwestward as it attained typhoon status before returning to a more westerly track later that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATCR&quot;/&gt;

As the TUTT gradually warmed, Gordon was able to undergo a prolonged period of [[Rapid deepening|rapid intensification]], despite having restricted [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]]. Over a 30&amp;nbsp;hour period from July&amp;nbsp;14 to 15, the storm's central [[barometric pressure|pressure]] decreased by 70&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] ([[Pascal (unit)|hPa]]; 2.07&amp;nbsp;[[Inches of Mercury|inHg]]), just below the threshold for [[Rapid deepening#Explosive intensification|explosive intensification]]. At the end of this phase, Gordon attained its peak strength as a [[SSHS#Category 5|Category&amp;nbsp;5 equivalent]] super typhoon with winds estimated at 260&amp;nbsp;km/h (160&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=&quot;ATCR&quot;/&gt; Around the same time, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency|Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)]] assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185&amp;nbsp;km/h (115&amp;nbsp;mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.02&amp;nbsp;inHg).&lt;ref name=&quot;JMABT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Japan Meteorological Agency|date=October 10, 1992|title=RSMC Best Track Data - 1980-1989|accessdate=March 27, 2012|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/Besttracks/bst8089.txt|format=[[.TXT|TXT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] is the official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] for the western Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Japan Meteorological Organization|title=Annual Report on Activities of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center 2000|date=February 2001|accessdate=March 27, 2012|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/AnnualReport/2000/Text/Text2000.pdf|page=3|format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

Once classified a super typhoon, Gordon acquired a slight northerly component to its track and maintained a general west-northwestward trajectory for the remainder of its existence. Late on July&amp;nbsp;15, Gordon made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in northern [[Luzon]], [[Philippines]], at peak intensity. Remaining over land for several hours, the storm quickly weakened before entering the [[South China Sea]]. The system maintained minimal typhoon status as it developed a large, ragged [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] by July&amp;nbsp;17. Slight weakening took place hours before Gordon made landfall as a strong tropical storm near [[Zhanjiang]] in [[Southern China]] on July&amp;nbsp;18. Briefly moving over the warm, shallow waters of the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], Gordon's convective structure tripled in size; however, the system continued to weaken. Later that day, the storm made its final landfall in southern [[Guangxi|Guangxi Province]]. Once onshore, Gordon quickly weakened and was last noted on July&amp;nbsp;19 by the JMA over southern Guangxi.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATCR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMABT&quot;/&gt;

==Preparations and impact==

===Philippines===
Across Luzon, air traffic was temporarily suspended on July&amp;nbsp;16 until the typhoon's passage. Storm signal three, the highest level of warning, was issued for five provinces while lesser warnings were in place for most of the northern Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHPprep1&quot;/&gt; The [[Philippine Coast Guard]] ordered all vessels in Luzon to remain at port until the storm's passage. Residents along the coast were urged to take &quot;extreme precaution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 15, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Typhoon Roars Toward Philippines, U.S. Bases on Alert|location=Manila, Philippines}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt; All activities at the United State's [[Clark Air Base]] were canceled on July&amp;nbsp;16 while emergency rescue and cleanup teams were placed on standby. All non-essential personnel were ordered to remain home.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHPprep1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 16, 1989|accessdate=January 11, 2012|title=Typhoon Gordon Weakens As It Hits Land|location=Manila, Philippines}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt;

Striking northern Luzon on July&amp;nbsp;16, Typhoon Gordon packed sustained winds estimated at 260&amp;nbsp;km/h (160&amp;nbsp;mph),&lt;ref name=&quot;ATCR&quot;/&gt; though the strongest reported winds reached 186&amp;nbsp;km/h (116&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=&quot;TPP1&quot;/&gt; At [[Wallace Air Station]], wind gusts reached {{convert|126|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Torrential rains accompanying the storm, measured up to 747&amp;nbsp;mm (29.8&amp;nbsp;in) at Clark Air Base, caused widespread flooding and landslides.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATCR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TPP1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|location=Manila, Philippines|date=July 17, 1989|accessdate=January 12, 2012|title=Typhoon kills 12|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PnQcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xGMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=typhoon%20gordon&amp;pg=4353%2C1706819|page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across [[Cagayan Valley]], flash flooding prompted thousands of residents to evacuate to higher ground. Travel in much of the region was severely impaired as landslides blocked off roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Xinhua General News|date=July 16, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Typhoon Hits Northern Philippines|location=Manila, Philippines}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baguio]] was mostly isolated from surrounding areas as the main roads leading in and out of the city were blocked off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=United Press International|date=July 16, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Typhoon Gordon claims seven lives in the Philippines|location=Manila, Philippines}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Paoay, Ilocos Norte|Paoay]], a bridge was washed out and high winds from the typhoon tore the roof off a public market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 16, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Typhoon Batters Philippines; At Least Five Dead|location=Manila, Philippines}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Philippine Red Cross]], nearly 11,000 people were in evacuation shelters by the evening of July&amp;nbsp;16 in [[Ilocos Norte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=United Press International|date=July 17, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Typhoon kills 22 in Philippines|location=Manila, Philippines}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[La Union]], three towns were submerged in flood waters up to rooftops of homes after a river burst its banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 17, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Storm Leaves Thousands Homeless|location=Manila, Philippines}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the country, 90 fatalities resulted from the typhoon. Additionally, 386 people were injured while another 3 were listed as missing. A total of 8,845 homes were destroyed and another 46,269 sustained damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDCC&quot;/&gt; An estimated 120,000 people were left homeless due to Gordon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATCR&quot;/&gt; Losses from the typhoon amounted to 1.36&amp;nbsp;billion [[Philippine peso|pesos]] ($62&amp;nbsp;million USD).&lt;ref name=&quot;NDCC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters|year=2012|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=International Disaster Database: Disaster List|url=http://www.emdat.be/disaster-list}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July&amp;nbsp;18, relief operations began across northern Luzon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Philippine Star|publisher=Xinhua General News|date=July 19, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Relief Operations In Full Swing|location=Manila, Philippines}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] declared a [[state of emergency|state of calamity]] for five provinces and three towns by this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;UPI1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=United Press International|date=July 19, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Typhoon kills five in China, strands thousands|location=Beijing, China}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt;

On July&amp;nbsp;15, the [[Central Weather Bureau]] issued a sea warning for the [[Bashi Channel]] and waters off the southeast coast of [[Taiwan]]. Residents were also warned of possible heavy, flooding rains and were urged to take precautions to minimize loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Central News Agency|date=July 15, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Sea Warning Issued As Typhoon Gordon Moves Closer|location=Taipei, Taiwan}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded as the &quot;fiercest typhoon to threaten [[Hong Kong]] in five years,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HongKong1&quot;/&gt; the [[Hong Kong Observatory]] began issuing [[Hong Kong tropical cyclone warning signals|storm signals]] by July&amp;nbsp;16 to warn residents of the approaching storm. Early the next day, the signal was raised to three (strong wind signal) before being further increased to signal eight (gale warning) that afternoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;HKO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Hong Kong Observatory|date=October 1990|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Tropical Cyclones In 1989|url=http://www.hko.gov.hk/publica/tc/tc1989.pdf|format=PDF|location=Hong Kong|pages=32â€“37}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ferries to and from [[Macao]] were halted and all schools were closed. Warnings urging residents to take steps to avoid unnecessary losses were continuously broadcast over radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;HongKong1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Xinhua General News|date=July 17, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Typhoon Gordon Approaching South China Coast|location=Hong Kong}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt; The normally busy Hong Kong was brought to a standstill as businesses, banks and courts closed for the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;HongKong2&quot;/&gt; This included the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HongKong3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=United Press International|date=July 18, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Killer Typhoon Gordon moves into China|location=Beijing, China}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Xinhua General News|date=July 18, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Foreign Exchange Rates In Hong Kong|location=Hong Kong}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt; Public transport was mostly shut down and the government opened 78 shelters. Thousands of people were evacuated from low-lying areas along the coast. Approximately 11,000 Vietnamese &quot;boat people&quot; were also moved to emergency shelters.&lt;ref name=&quot;HongKong2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 17, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Hong Kong Battens Down as Typhoon Gordon Approaches|location=Hong Kong}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt;

Winds up to {{convert|192|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} battered parts of Hong Kong, downing numerous trees, snapping power poles and blowing out windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;HKO&quot;/&gt; Driven by the intense winds, airborne debris injured 31, 6 of whom required hospitalization.&lt;ref name=&quot;HongKong3&quot;/&gt; Two fatalities took place in the territory: one on [[Lantau Island]] and another in [[Tai O]]. Some flooding took place as a result of Gordon, especially along coastal areas where the typhoon brought a [[storm surge]] of {{convert|1.36|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;HKO&quot;/&gt;

In Macao, high winds from the typhoon uprooted trees and broke windows. Flooding triggered by Gordon's heavy rains stranded cars and inundated stores. Five of the colony's six [[casino]]es were temporarily closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Reuters|publisher=The Toronto Star|date=July 18, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2012|title=Typhoon lashes China|page=B6|location=Hong Kong}} (accessed through LexisNexis)&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding also caused the [[Ponte Governador Nobre de Carvalho|Macau-Taipa bridge]] to collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;HKO&quot;/&gt;

===China===
Striking [[Guangdong Province]] as a strong tropical storm, Gordon caused extensive damage in the region. Along the coast, approximately {{convert|155|km|mi|abbr=on}} of dykes were destroyed by [[storm surge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HKO&quot;/&gt; Already suffering from extensive floods, heavy rains and record [[storm tide|tides]] from Typhoon Gordon caused &quot;massive&quot; flooding in [[Zhuhai]], [[Guangdong]].
