'''Great Northern Highway''' links [[Western Australia]]'s capital city [[Perth]] with its northernmost port, [[Wyndham, Western Australia|Wyndham]]. With a length of almost {{convert|3200|km|mi|-2}}, it is the longest highway in Australia, with the majority included as part of the Perth Darwin [[National Highway (Australia)|National Highway]]. The highway is constructed as a [[Sealed road|sealed]], predominantly two-lane single carriageway, but with some single-lane bridges in the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]]. Great Northern Highway travels through remote areas of the state, and is the only sealed road link between the [[Northern Territory]] and northern Western Australia. Economically, it provides vital access through the [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] and [[Mid West (Western Australia)|Mid West]] to the resource-rich regions of the [[Pilbara]] and Kimberley. In these areas, the key industries of mining, agriculture and pastoral [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]], and tourism are all dependent on the highway.

In Perth, the highway begins in [[Midland, Western Australia|Midland]] near [[Great Eastern Highway]], and further north intersects the [[Reid Highway|Reid]] and [[Roe Highway|Roe]] highways, which together form Perth's [[ring road]]. There are also three rural highways that spur off Great Northern Highway. [[Brand Highway]] and [[North West Coastal Highway]] provide an alternative coastal route between [[Muchea, Western Australia|Muchea]] and [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]], while [[Victoria Highway]] carries the National Highway route and interstate traffic into the Northern Territory. Various [[List of road routes in Western Australia|road routes]] are allocated to sections of Great Northern Highway, including the [[Highway 1 (Australia)|Highway&amp;nbsp;1]] routes [[List of road routes in Western Australia#R1|National Route&amp;nbsp;1]] and [[List of road routes in Western Australia#1|National Highway&amp;nbsp;1]], as well as [[List of road routes in Western Australia#95|National Highway&amp;nbsp;95]].

The highway was created in 1944 from existing roads in the Wheatbelt and a series of tracks through [[Remote Western Australia|remote pastoral areas]]. However, it was a hazardous route that could be dusty in the dry season, and boggy or washed away in the wet season. Some sections were effectively impassable sand, while others contained limestone outcrops. Economic growth and development in northern Western Australia prompted initial improvement efforts, and the federal government's Beef Roads Scheme in the 1960s resulted in a noticeably higher-quality road in the Kimberley. Construction of a sealed road from Perth to Wyndham, including numerous bridges to reduce the impact of seasonal flooding, took many years to complete. The last section opened on 16 December 1989, and received national media coverage. However, by then many older sections were either worn out or not up to modern standards. Various upgrades have been carried out in small sections, across the length of the highway, with further works planned. A major realignment of the highway in Perth is scheduled for construction between 2016 and 2019, as part of the [[NorthLink WA]] project that will also upgrade [[Tonkin Highway]].

==Route description==
Great Northern Highway is the main north-south route between Perth and the northern areas of Western Australia.

Overall, Great Northern Highway performs favourably in terms of road safety, compared to other major highways in Western Australia. Whilst making up two thirds of the state's National Highway network, it was the location of only half of all recorded fatalities for 2005–2009. For that period, the sections of the highway from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse, north-east of Port Hedland, were considered by the Australian Automobile Association to be among the lowest risk highway links in the state. However, the section from Perth to Wubin was rated as medium risk, and the northern sections of the highway were rated medium-high and high risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowSafeRoads2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.asn.au/documents/reports%2F2012%2FAusRAP-report-2011-How-Safe-Are-Our-Roads.pdf |format=PDF |title=How Safe are our Roads?

The highway heads north through [[Middle Swan, Western Australia|Middle Swan]], intersecting the start of [[Toodyay Road]] after {{convert|1.3|km|1}}, and then the meeting point of Reid and Roe Highways after another {{convert|1.4|km|1}}. Those highways come together from Perth's ring road, signed as State Route&amp;nbsp;3, and north of this intersection Great Northern Highway is concurrently allocated National Highway&amp;nbsp;95 and National Route&amp;nbsp;1. It continues north through the [[Swan Valley (Western Australia)|Swan Valley]] for {{convert|9.5|km|0}}, passing many wineries, restaurants, and other tourist attractions. The highway crosses the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] and intersects West Swan Road, before turning north-east to travel around the residential part of [[Upper Swan, Western Australia|Upper Swan]]. Great Northern Highway continues north for {{convert|spell=in|13|km|0}} beyond West Swan Road, past larger agricultural properties, to reach [[Bullsbrook, Western Australia|Bullsbrook]], the last urban area within the [[Perth Metropolitan Region]]. After {{convert|11.5|km|0}} beyond Bullsbrook, the highway reaches the edge of the [[Perth metropolitan area]] at the [[City of Swan]]–[[Shire of Chittering]] boundary, where it passes into the Wheatbelt.&lt;ref name=&quot;gmaps Midland-Muchea&quot;&gt;{{Google maps|url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/-31.8860446,116.0055686/-31.8754365,116.009892/-31.8640956,116.0139692/-31.7800115,116.022226/-31.6699084,116.0308282/-31.6019846,116.0105718/-31.5767239,115.9959914/@-31.7081544,116.0182467,11z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e0 |accessdate=20 June 2014 |title=Great Northern Highway: Midland to Muchea |link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid West===
[[File:Yalgoo Shire.jpg|thumb|North-east of Wubin, the highway travels into the [[Outback]].]]
As Great Northern Highway heads north-east from Wubin out of the Wheatbelt, the vegetation changes to arid shrubland. In the [[Mid West (Western Australia)|Mid West region]], the long stretches between settlements show few signs of human activity, other than the highway itself. The first such settlement is [[Paynes Find, Western Australia|Paynes Find]], {{convert|154|km}} out from Wubin. At this point the highway heads north again, reaching [[Mount Magnet, Western Australia|Mount Magnet]] after {{convert|143|km}}, and then [[Cue, Western Australia|Cue]] after another {{convert|80|km}}. The road travels north-east for {{convert|115|km}} to [[Meekatharra, Western Australia|Meekatharra]], and then has a long {{convert|412|km|adj=on}} stretch up to the northern edge of the Mid West at the [[Fortescue River]], near [[Newman Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gmaps Wubin-FortescueRiver&quot;&gt;{{Google maps |url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/-30.1055496,116.6304408/PAYNES+FIND/-28.0652336,117.8486931/-27.4234402,117.898377/-26.5910594,118.4963577/-23.4011818,119.7944349/@-26.0157079,118.2143149,6z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x2bc8d6c8f25e56d7:0x400f6382479d1f0!2m2!1d117.6946024!2d-29.2591263!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e0 |accessdate=21 June 2014 |title=Great Northern Highway: Wubin to Fortescue River |link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MRWA MW&quot;&gt;{{cite map |publisher=Government of Western Australia |author=Main Roads Western Australia |title=Mid West Region Map |date=16 August 2013 |url=https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/REGION%20STATE%20ROAD%20CONDITION%20MAP%20138%20138%20MID%20WEST.RCN-D13%5E233479.PDF |version=Version 1.0 |scale=1:892,857 |accessdate = 12 January 2014|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6JE6QvGbi|archivedate = 29 August 2013|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halfway along this stretch the highway passes a [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] at [[Kumarina, Western Australia|Kumarina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ISA MW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Midwest and Gascoyne Network|url=https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/ISA%20Network%20-%20Midwest%20and%20Gascoyne%20-%20Phased%20Implementation.u_3137500r_1n_0921-0162%5E2F04.PDF|work=Integrated Service Arrangement|publisher=Main Roads Western Australia|accessdate=12 January 2014|format=PDF|date=28 February 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IaO8pcK4|archivedate=3 August 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{convert|spell=In|4|km}} after crossing the Fortescue River, Great Northern Highway intersects [[Marble Bar Road]], the highway's original alignment. It proceeds north to [[Marble Bar, Western Australia|Marble Bar]], mostly as an unsealed road, whilst the highway  deviates north-west, reaching [[Newman, Western Australia|Newman]] after {{convert|3|km|spell = in|0}}. The flat landscape gives way to gentle [[range (geographic)|ranges]], which the highway meanders around as it heads west-north-west for {{convert|109|km}}. It then curves around to the north, proceeding over a distance of {{convert|48|km}} to [[Karijini Road]], the entrance road to the Karijini National Park. The highway continues north for another {{convert|35|km}}, travelling through the north-eastern corner of the national park to [[Nanutarra Munjina Road]]. Great Northern Highway proceeds on its journey north, crossing the [[Yule River]] and its tributaries. The highway then runs parallel to the [[Turner River]] over a {{convert|220|km|adj=on}} distance until it reaches [[North West Coastal Highway]]. This junction is the northern terminus of the National Highway&amp;nbsp;95, and Great Northern Highway continues north-east as National Highway&amp;nbsp;1 – part of Australia's [[Highway&amp;nbsp;1 (Australia)|Highway&amp;nbsp;1]], which is signed as National Route&amp;nbsp;1 along North West Coastal Highway. The turnoff for Port Hedland is {{convert|32|km}} north-east of the intersection, and from there the highway heads east for {{convert|40|km}} to the northern end of Marble Bar Road, and reaching [[Pardoo, Western Australia|Pardoo]] after another {{convert|72|km}}.

==History==

===Highway origins===
The name Great Northern Highway was first proposed in October 1940 by the state's Nomenclature Advisory Committee,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Now the Geographic Names Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic Names Committee|url=http://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/corporate.nsf/web/Geographic+Names+Committee|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=22 March 2014|author=Western Australian Land Information Authority|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802165311/http://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/corporate.nsf/web/Geographic+Names+Committee|archivedate=2 August 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} to describe the main route from Midland to [[Geraldton, Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=MJA1940&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46744914 |title=Midland Junction Affairs |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth, WA |date=23 October 1940 |accessdate=22 March 2014 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was following the naming of the Great Eastern and [[Great Southern Highway|Great Southern]] highways.&lt;ref name=&quot;GLaG&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article67277690|title = Local and General|newspaper = [[Geraldton Guardian and Express]]|date = 24 October 1940|accessdate = 22 March 2014|page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Midland Junction Municipal Council approved the name,&lt;ref name=MJA1940 /&gt; however at the Geraldton Municipal Council meeting, one councillor suggested that Great Midland Highway would be a better name. The reasoning was that Geraldton was in the centre of the state's coastline, not in the north. It was explained that the highway would continue north past Geraldton, and the council voted to approve the name.&lt;ref name=GLaG /&gt;

By July 1941, the Nomenclature Advisory Committee's proposal had expanded to three highway names for the roads in the state's northern areas: Great Northern Highway for &quot;the road from Midland Junction Town Hall to Wyndham, via Walebing, Pithara, Wubin, Payne's Find, Mt. Magnet, Cue, Nannine, Meekatharra, Roy Hill, Nullagine, Marble Bar, Mulyee, De Grey, Pardoo, Wallal, Anna Plains, Le Grange, Broome, Derby, Noonkanbah, Fitzroy Crossing, Christmas Creek, Louisa Downs, Hall's Creek and Turkey Creek&quot;,&lt;ref name=NHwys /&gt; North West Coastal Highway for &quot;the road from Geraldton to De Grey, via Northampton, Galena, Carnarvon, Boolaganoo, Winning Pool, Giralia, Yanrey, Onslow, Peedamullah, Mardie, Karratha, Roebourne, Whim Creek, Mundabullangana and Port Hedland&quot;,&lt;ref name=NHwys /&gt; and Geraldton Highway for &quot;the road from Walebing to Geraldton via Mingenew&quot;.&lt;ref name=NHwys&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47153477 |title=Northern Highways |newspaper=The West Australian |location=Perth, WA |date=23 July 1941 |accessdate=22 March 2014 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Modern-day [[The Midlands Road]] and [[Brand Highway]]&lt;ref name=&quot;MRWA WN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MRWA MW&quot;/&gt;}} The proposal was well received by the local municipal councils and road boards.&lt;ref name=NHwys /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article67313098|title = Local and General|newspaper = Geraldton Guardian and Express|date = 31 July 1941|accessdate = 22 March 2014|page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article67312173|title = Greenough Road Board|newspaper = Geraldton Guardian and Express|date = 14 August 1941|accessdate = 22 March 2014|page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fortescue in flood 1942 (retouched).jpg|thumb|A car struggles to cross the flooded Fortescue River (February 1942).]]
The name Great Northern Highway was [[gazette]]d on 10 March 1944, under section&amp;nbsp;10 of the Land Act, 1933–1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazetted 1944&quot;&gt;{{Gazette WA|title=The Land Act, 1933–1937: Naming of Highway|file=1944/11|page=1944:165|date=10 March 1944|url=https://www.slp.wa.gov.au/gazette/gazette.nsf/searchgazette/A50B3BCCDBA73B5C48257727007C5D0C/$file/gg011.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the highway was mostly a series of tracks through remote pastoral areas, with the [[sealed road]] ending just past the Wheatbelt town of Miling in 1950.{{efn|1=Between 1926 and 1928, the newly formed Main Roads Board (predecessor to the Main Roads Department, later renamed [[Main Roads Western Australia]]) took over control and maintenance of the road from Midland Junction to Meekatharra, and twenty-one other important roads, which were declared &quot;main roads&quot;. To increase the usability of the overall main road network, the work schedule for these roads prioritised sealing the worst individual segments, rather than any one road. For example, in 1928/29, twenty-two separate sections of the [[Albany Highway|Perth–Albany road]] were improved, but the whole route was not completed until 1939.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|27–28, 435}}}}&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|120}} Driving was difficult and hazardous all year round. The road was very dusty in the [[dry season]], and some sections of the road were effectively impassable sand, while other sections contained limestone [[outcrop]]s that damaged tyres. During the [[wet season]], when rivers flooded, sections of road were essentially [[bog]]s, or worse still, were completely washed away.&lt;ref name=&quot;VL&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first = Leigh|last = Edmonds|title = The Vital Link: A History of Main Roads Western Australia 1926–1996|publisher = University of Western Australia Press|location = Nedlands, WA|year = 1997|isbn = 1-875560-87-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120–121}}

===Sealing the highway===

====Initial efforts====
Economic growth and development in Western Australia's northern regions in the 1940s prompted the state to quadruple road funding between 1946 and 1952. Five &quot;gangs&quot; of workers were allocated to a {{convert|1600|mi|km|adj = on}} length of Great Northern Highway between Meekatharra and Wyndham. However, given the vast distance the highway travelled, and destructive cyclones in the Pilbara and Gascoyne that could destroy multiple weeks worth of work, the overall improvement was relatively insignificant. Over time, though, the road was improved.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|120–121}} New alignments were constructed, such as between Derby and Fitzroy Crossing in the late 1940s, which had originally followed the curve of the Fitzroy River, along its floodplain, and could only be used in the dry season. The new alignment was a more direct {{convert|180|mi|adj=on}} section, with the first {{convert|5|mi|0|spell=in}} sealed, a total of {{convert|68|mi}} of gravel road, and the remainder simply [[Dirt road|formed earth]]. Despite this low construction standard, the road remained passable except for short periods during heavy rain.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|120–121}}

====Beef Roads Scheme====
In 1961, the [[Government of Australia|federal government]] passed the Western Australian Grants (Beef Cattle Roads) Act 1961, known as the [[Beef Roads Scheme]], that encouraged road building in the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]].&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|168}} This had followed on from an earlier federal grant scheme in 1949 for the construction of a road from [[Nicholson, Western Australia|Nicholson]] to Wyndham.{{Refn|Modern-day [[Duncan Road]]&lt;ref name=RIMS /&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} The road allowed trucks to efficiently transport cattle to port, rather than the slow cattle drives that could lose stock and take weeks to complete.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|122}} The 1961 Beef Roads Scheme initially included upgrading the Wyndham to Halls Creek section of Great Northern Highway as one of three projects in the region. One year later the scheme was expanded to include the Broome to Halls Creek section of the highway, and several bridge construction projects.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|168}} However, the resources allocated to Great Northern Highway were needed to maintain the highway as an unsealed road in a usable condition, rather than to completely seal the roadway. In 1963, work was completed on stabilising a {{convert|42|mi|adj=on}} sandy section to prevent vehicles from becoming bogged, a {{convert|29|mi|adj=on}} section was realigned to avoid the [[Fortescue River]] floodplain, and {{convert|25|mi}} between Marble Bar and Port Hedland was also realigned to minimise the effects of wet weather.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|186}}

====Perth to Newman====
The projects funded by the Beef Roads Scheme resulted in a noticeably higher quality road in the Kimberley,&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|221}} but work still progressed on other sections of the highway. In 1970, a single-lane sealed section was completed between Perth and Meekatharra. The project was one of the first in the state to be constructed by contractors rather than by Main Roads directly. It cost $9&amp;nbsp;million, two-thirds of which was spent after 1959.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|220}} The next section to be upgraded and sealed was from Meekatharra to Newman, a {{convert|414|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} project that would take four and a half years to construct. Due to the remoteness of the location, airstrips were built alongside the highway, so that workers could be flown in from Geraldton. The highway was realigned in several spots, to avoid difficult areas, improve river crossings, or give drivers a more scenic view of the surrounding area. New bridges were constructed along the route, including a reinforced concrete bridge at the Fortescue River, and a four-span bridge over the Gascoyne River's Middle Branch. By December 1978, the sealed road reached Newman, with the project completed three months ahead of schedule, and at a cost of $20&amp;nbsp;million,  $1&amp;nbsp;million under budget. With a {{convert|7.4|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} seal and {{convert|2.4|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-wide}} [[shoulder (road)|shoulders]], the road could easily accommodate two lanes of traffic. Previously sealed sections, totalling {{convert|485|km}} of the highway, were less than half that width. Premier [[Charles Court]] opened the new and improved highway on 12 December 1978.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|297–9}}

====Port Hedland to Wyndham====
The two-lane sealed road between Halls Creek and Wyndham was also completed in 1978. It involved the construction of 21 bridges, and extensive earthworks designed to blend the road into the terrain. The section was opened on 23 July 1978 by the Minister for Transport, at a cost of over $20&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|299–300}} Meanwhile, work on sealing and upgrading the {{convert|476|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} section from Port Hedland and Broome began in 1976. With up to five contractors and four Main Roads teams working throughout the project, it was completed at an extraordinarily rapid pace. It opened in April 1981 at a cost of $56&amp;nbsp;million. With the opening of this section, tourist traffic escalated. Cape Keraudren, [[Eighty Mile Beach]], and Broome became increasingly favoured destinations, especially for residents of the Pilbara.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|301}}

[[File:Onderweg - Fitzroy Crossing - Purnululu (8991950691).jpg|thumb|Great Northern Highway south-east of Fitzroy Crossing]]
Work accelerated in the 1980s as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] Road Development program. From October 1982, the program provided $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion to upgrade the country's roads in the lead up to Australia's bicentenary in 1988.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|302}} By this time, the only sections of Great Northern Highway yet to be sealed were a {{convert|275|km|adj=on}} stretch from Fitzroy Crossing to Halls Creek, and another {{convert|416|km}} between Newman and Port Hedland.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|314}} Construction of the Fitzroy Crossing to Halls Creek section began in October 1981. The route had been surveyed in 1979; with the collaboration of the [[Western Australian Museum]], Main Roads ensured it would not impact important Aboriginal heritage sites. After five years of work, including the construction of nine bridges, the widened and sealed section was completed on 7 September 1986. At the time, this was the final section of the nationwide Highway&amp;nbsp;1 to be sealed, and there was national interest. The media captured the completion on camera, while the federal Minister for Transport, [[Peter Morris (politician)|Peter Morris]], together with the Western Australian Minister for the North West, [[Ernie Bridge]], rode on the bitumen truck for the final spray.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|318–20}} With this section completed, the Newman to Port Hedland section of Great Northern Highway was the only significant section of unsealed highway in Western Australia.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|320}}

====Newman to Port Hedland====
A realignment of the highway between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]] instead of Marble Bar.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|238}} In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.&lt;ref name=&quot;VL&quot; /&gt;{{rp|362–5}}

[[File:Early 1992 - Gt Northern Hwy in Munjina Gorge, WA (8091933962).jpg|thumb|left|Great Northern Highway curves down through Munjina Gorge.]]
As the highway would pass through the [[Hamersley National Park]],{{refn|Renamed Karijini National Park in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Department of Conservation and Land Management |author2=National Parks and Nature Conservation Authority |title=Karijini National Park Management Plan No. 40 |url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/pdf/nature/management/karijini.pdf |format=PDF |page=1 |publisher=Government of Western Australia |year=1999 |accessdate=25 June 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110312061348/http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/pdf/nature/management/karijini.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2011 |deadurl=yes}} {{cite archives |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6bS7KPw1m |archivedate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} the [[Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia|Environmental Protection Authority]] decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was required for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;VL&quot; /&gt;{{rp|362–5}}

In early 1986, the contract for this {{convert|12|km|adj=on}} segment through the Munjina and Mungina East gorges was awarded. Construction of this segment involved tight control over earthworks and machinery movements, to protect the National Park ecology. The finished road was a scenic route curving down through the Munjina Gorge and out onto the Fortescue River flood plain, with cuttings and embankments blending it in with the natural environment. It was opened on 12 June 1987 by the federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, having cost $28.4 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;VL&quot; /&gt;{{rp|362–5}}

Other portions of the Newman – Port Hedland link were completed over the next two years,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The contractors involved in the construction of the route between Newman and Port Hedland were [[CIMIC Group#Leighton Contractors|Leighton Contractors]], F.K.

===Fitzroy River crossing, Willare===
In the late 1960s, Main Roads investigated alternative crossing points over the Fitzroy River, to replace the existing low-level bridge at Yeeda. Flooding in January 1966 had demonstrated that Willare was the best site. The new route would be {{convert|8|mi|0|spell=in}} longer, and required two bridges, but would result in a better quality road. When tenders were called, the river flooded again, washing away {{convert|170|ft}} of the old bridge. Rather than reconstruct the low-level crossing, the construction timeframe was shortened from 18 months to 38 weeks. The {{convert|1280|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Willare Bridge and {{convert|640|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Minnie River Bridge opened on 12 June 1968, having cost almost $700,000. While situated {{convert|7|ft|spell = in}} higher than the worst known flood level, the single-lane bridges were designed to accommodate more extensive flood levels, with the water flowing over them if necessary.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|221}}

By the early 1980s, it was clear that the Fitzroy River crossing was still inadequate. Seasonal flooding had closed the road several times, and damaged the embankments leading up the bridges. The crossing had been closed for twenty four days in 1982; while in 1983, the most severe flooding since 1914 extensively damaged {{convert|2.6|km}} of the highway, closing it for twenty-five days. To alleviate the problem, two new bridges were built in 1985, and the road was widened and raised {{convert|2|to|3|m|spell = in}} above the flood plain. The earthworks for the project included constructing guide banks to direct excess water to flow over floodways, which were protected with rocks. This was designed to minimise the time the road would be closed in such a scenario. The $11&amp;nbsp;million upgraded crossing was opened on 19 December 1985 by the federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris. Then, one month later, [[1985–86 Australian region cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Hector|Cyclone Hector]] produced 70% more water than the crossing had been designed for. Water overflowed the road all along the flood plain, not just at designated floodways, ravaging the shoulders and then destroying sections of road. {{convert|spell=In|4|to|5|km}} of the highway was washed away, leaving the bridges isolated and disconnected. The road was closed from 27 January to 14 February 1986, with $200,000 spent just to make the crossing passable. It was then redesigned and rebuilt at a cost of $1.9&amp;nbsp;million to make it more flood resistant.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|315–8}}

===Further improvements===

Despite the provision of a completely sealed road, there was still much work to be done on the highway, with many older sections either worn out or not up to modern standards. Narrow sections were widened to a full {{convert|spell=in|7|m}}, and repairs made to the road, shoulders, fencing, and [[Road surface marking|line markings]] as required, with work carried out in sections and progressing along the length of the highway.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|366}} Four [[overtaking lane]]s were constructed between Mount Magnet and Cue in 1991; and between 1991 and 1993, there were eight contracts awarded to widen, reconstruct, and seal a combined total of more than {{convert|190|km}} of the highway.&lt;ref name=VL /&gt;{{rp|366}}

A range of projects were carried out across the length of the highway between 1996 and 2006. By 1998, a {{convert|157|km|adj=on}} section between the Sandfire Roadhouse and Victoria Highway had been improved at a cost of $1.1&amp;nbsp;million, and another {{convert|42|km}} north of Meekatharra was improved for $12&amp;nbsp;million in 1999. Two bridges were constructed in the vicinity of Halls Creek in 2000, and another four in 2004/05, replacing floodways so that the highway would remain open during floods. Similarly, {{convert|100|km}} north of Halls Creek, the {{convert|240|m|mi|adj=mid|-long}} Jarlalu Bridge over the Ord River was constructed to replace a single-lane floodway, and was opened in January 2003. That same year, the bridges over the Fortescue and Gascoyne Rivers were strengthened to increase the highway's load capacity. Modifications were made to the steep ascent of the [[Darling Scarp]] at Bindoon Hill between February 2002 and April 2003, and Great Northern Highway was realigned to bypass the Dalwallinu town centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;VLTTY&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Edmonds|first1 = Leigh|title = The Vital Link: The Transition Years 1996–2006|date = 2008|publisher = Main Roads Western Australia|location = East Perth, WA|isbn = 0-7309-7692-0|pages = 24–25, 28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stage of construction is being undertaken as part of the NorthLink WA project. Tonkin Highway's northern section will be [[grade separation|grade separated]], and the road extended northwards past [[Ellenbrook, Western Australia|Ellenbrook]] to Great Northern Highway near Brand Highway. The previously planned route of the bypass, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of [[Whiteman Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/New-Darwin-route/7623855/ |title=New Darwin Route |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012 |last=Frank |first=Caroline |newspaper=The Advocate |location=Midland, WA |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IRfFUSra |archivedate=28 July 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is funded by both the state and federal governments.
