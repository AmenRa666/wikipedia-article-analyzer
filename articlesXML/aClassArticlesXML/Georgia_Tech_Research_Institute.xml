The '''Georgia Tech Research Institute''' ('''GTRI''') is the nonprofit [[applied research]] arm of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]]. GTRI employs around 1,765&amp;nbsp;people, and is involved in approximately $305&amp;nbsp;million in research annually for more than 200&amp;nbsp;clients in industry and government.

Initially known as the '''Engineering Experiment Station''', ('''EES''') the organization was proposed in 1929 by [[W. Harry Vaughan]] as an analogue to the [[agricultural experiment station]]s; the [[Georgia General Assembly]] passed a law that year creating the organization on paper, but did not allocate funds to start it. To boost the state's struggling economy in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], funds were found, and the station was finally established with [[United States dollar|US$]]5,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|5000|1934}}|-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}){{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} in April 1934.
 
GTRI's research spans a variety of disciplines, including national [[Defense (military)|defense]], [[homeland security]], [[public health]], [[education]], mobile and wireless technologies, and [[economic development]]. Major customers for GTRI research include [[United States Department of Defense]] agencies, the state of Georgia, non-defense [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]], and private industry. Overall, contracts and grants from Department of Defense agencies account for approximately 84% of GTRI's total research funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR2014p7&quot;/&gt; Since it was established, GTRI has expanded its engineering focus to include [[science]], [[economics]], [[policy]], and other areas that leverage GTRI's partnership with Georgia Tech. GTRI researchers are named on 76 active patents and 43 pending patents.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/about-us|title=About GTRI|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being founded in 1885, [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] grew from a trade school into a university over the course of several decades. However, there was little state initiative to see the school expand significantly until 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Combes, Richard|url=http://www.cherry.gatech.edu/sim/refs/combes.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901140557/http://www.cherry.gatech.edu/sim/refs/combes.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-01|title=Origins of Industrial Extension: A Historical Case Study|publisher=School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology|year=1992|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-28|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, in a move similar to the [[Hatch Act of 1887]]'s establishment of [[agricultural experiment station]]s, the federal debate over whether to create engineering experiment stations in a similar manner spurred the [[Georgia General Assembly]] to pass an act titled &quot;Establishing State Engineering Experiment Station at the Georgia School of Technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1910s&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1910s.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016201916/http://gtalumni.org/Publications/timeline/1910s.html|archivedate=2007-10-16|title=Tech Timeline: 1910s|work=Georgia Tech Traditions|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This station was established with the goal of the &quot;encouragement of industries and commerce&quot; within the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;/&gt; The federal effort ultimately failed and the state did not finance the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dhwg238&quot;&gt;[[#Wal|Wallace, p. 238]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, some Georgia Tech faculty members belonging to [[Sigma Xi]] started a Research Club at Tech that met once a month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens186&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, pp. 186]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the monthly subjects, proposed by [[W. Harry Vaughan]], was a collection of issues related to Georgia Tech, such as library development, and the development of a state engineering station. This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiment stations at universities around the country, and a report was compiled by [[Harold Bunger]], [[Montgomery Knight]], and Vaughan in December 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens186&quot;/&gt; Their report noted that several similar organizations had been opened across the country at other engineering schools and were successful in local [[economic development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ens186&quot;/&gt;

In 1933, [[S. V. Sanford]], president of the University of Georgia, proposed that a &quot;technical research activity&quot; be established at Georgia Tech in order to boost the state's struggling economy in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. The Georgia Board of Regents provided the new Engineering Experiment Station with $5,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|5000|1934}}|-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}),{{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} and Georgia Tech provided infrastructure and personnel.  The station started operation in April 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens186&quot;/&gt;

===Early years===
[[File:Georgia Tech Hinman Building.jpg|thumb|left|The Thomas Hinman Research Building, built in 1939 and expanded in the 1950s.|alt=A black-and-white photograph of a one-story building with windows all along it and a multi-story portion of the building set further back from the road. In front of the building, there are two cars parked on a brick-paved road.]]
Vaughan was selected as the Engineering Experiment Station's acting director in April 1934, and hired 13 part-time faculty and a few graduate assistants.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens186&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gtrihist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-history/introduction-solving-problems-75-years|title=Introduction: Solving Problems for 75 Years|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station's initial areas of focus were [[textiles]], [[ceramic]]s, and [[helicopter]] engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;gtrihist&quot;/&gt; The early work of the station was conducted in the basement of the Old Shop Building next to [[Tech Tower]], and Vaughan's office was in the Aeronautical Engineering Building.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens187&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p.187]]&lt;/ref&gt; The station's name was technically the State Engineering Experiment Station, but it was generally referred to as the Engineering Experiment Station (EES) or simply &quot;the research station&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhwg238&quot;/&gt;

By 1938, the Engineering Experiment Station was producing useful technology, and the station needed a method to conduct contract work outside the state budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;/&gt; Consequently, the Industrial Development Council (IDC) was formed. The IDC was created as a non-profit contract organization for the EES, which allowed the EES to receive [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] contracts while still retaining its relationship with [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] and the State of Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhwg238&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens187&quot;/&gt; It was created by the Chancellor of the University System and the president of [[Georgia Power Company]], and the Engineering Experiment Station's director was a member of the council.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;/&gt; The IDC later became the [[Georgia Tech Research Corporation]], which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;/&gt; In addition, the contract organization manages the [[intellectual property]] that results from research.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens187&quot;/&gt;

Examples of projects undertaken under Vaughan's directorship include Montgomery Knight's helicopter research, the Georgia Economic Survey, $6,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|6000|1938}}|-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}){{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} in aeronautical research for the [[Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], and textile research that created cotton [[roving]] and spinning processes that were three to five times faster than contemporary practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhwg238&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vaughan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-forefathers/w-harry-vaughan|title=W. Harry Vaughan|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughan was instrumental in securing a permanent building for the station, initially known as the Research Building; several years later it was expanded and named the Thomas Hinman Research Building, after Atlanta dentist and university donor Thomas Hinman.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaughan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;installs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-history/ees-installs-&quot;electro-mechanical-brain&quot;|title=EES Installs &quot;Electro-Mechanical Brain&quot;|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Vaughan left for the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1940,&lt;ref name=&quot;vaughan&quot;/&gt; Harold Bunger (head of the Chemistry Department) took over as acting director. However, Bunger died not long thereafter in August 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens187&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens213&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 213]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-history/government-spurs-electronics-research|title=Government Spurs Electronics Research|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunger's successor was [[Gerald Rosselot]], who had been appointed assistant director by Georgia Tech's president in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;ross&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/ROSSELO.TGE.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912062616/http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/ROSSELO.TGE.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-12|title=Gerald A.

The number and value of contracts coming to the station significantly increased during [[World War II]]; the 1943–1944 budget was the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the station's other income, most notably, its state appropriation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens214&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 214]]&lt;/ref&gt; Director Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the Georgia General Assembly had cut the station's appropriation by 40%,&lt;ref name=&quot;ens213&quot;/&gt; but increased support from industry and government eventually compensated for lower state funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens214&quot;/&gt; World War II is credited with GTRI's entry into electronics, especially [[telecommunications]] and [[electronic warfare]]; the electronics and communications work that Director Rosselot attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research.&lt;ref name=&quot;elec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens216&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 216]]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the larger projects were a study on the [[radio propagation|propagation of electromagnetic waves]], and [[United States Navy]]–sponsored radar research.&lt;ref name=&quot;elec&quot;/&gt;

At the end of World War II, Georgia Tech had about $240,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|240000|1945}}|-5}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}){{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} annually in sponsored research.&lt;ref name=&quot;ross&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=05218664|title=Gerald Rosselot, past vice president of Bendix|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important investments during Rosselot's administration at the Engineering Experiment Station included the purchase of an [[electron microscope]] in 1946 for $13,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|13000|1946}}|-5}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}){{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}}, the first such instrument in the [[Southeastern United States]] and one of few in the United States at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/26051|title=New Microscope For Experiment Installed at Tech|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1946-01-19|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-history/solution-long-term-growth|title=A Solution to Long-Term Growth|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Research Building was expanded, and a $300,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|300000|1947}}|-5}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}){{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] [[Network analyzer (AC power)|A-C network calculator]] was given to Georgia Tech by [[Georgia Power]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;installs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/26183|title=Research Building Planned to House Expensive Calculator|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1946-08-03|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosselot's administration included the 1946 establishment of the Industrial Development Council, renamed to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1948 and to its present name, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;image&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-history/ees-shapes-new-image-and-gets-new-name|title=EES Shapes a New Image and Gets a New Name|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dhwg239&quot;&gt;[[#Wal|Wallace, p. 239]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Georgia Board of Regents]] had ruled that all money received in a year had to be spent that year, which was problematic because most government contracts the EES had received spanned multiple years.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt; Georgia Tech president Blake Van Leer and vice president [[Cherry Logan Emerson (engineer)|Cherry Emerson]] solution was to create the Industrial Development Council, a non-profit corporation that would manage contracts for research services and subsequently hire the Engineering Experiment Station to perform the research. It would handle patents garnered through research, and distribute funds garnered from contracts and patents as needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;growth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens215&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 215]]&lt;/ref&gt; The new organization was almost immediately used to weather a severe drop in state support (from $89,000 to $3,000) during the [[recession of 1949]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dhwg239&quot;/&gt;

===Scientific Atlanta===
[[Glen P. Robinson]] and six other Georgia Tech researchers (including Robinson's former professor and future EES director [[James E. Boyd (scientist)|Jim Boyd]] and EES director Gerald Rosselot) each contributed $100 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|100|1951}}|-3}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}){{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} and founded Scientific Associates (later known as [[Scientific Atlanta]]) on October 31, 1951 with the initial goal of marketing antenna structures being developed by the radar branch of the EES.&lt;ref name=&quot;ross&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-history/researchers-form-scientific-atlanta|title=Researchers form Scientific-Atlanta|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,830232,00.html|title=U.S. Business: One Way to Do It|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1963-04-26|accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson worked as the general manager without pay for the first year; after the fledgling company's first contract resulted in a $4,000 loss, Robinson (upon request) refunded five of the six other initial investors.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt;

From 1950 to 1952, there were a series of disputes between EES director Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station's finances and Rosselot's hand in founding Scientific Associates.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens262&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 262]]&lt;/ref&gt; When it was founded in October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech, and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in [[technology transfer]] to the marketplace.&lt;ref name=&quot;ross&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens263&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 263]]&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens263&quot;/&gt; However, Rosselot's participation in Scientific Associates' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech's [[VentureLab]] and the [[Advanced Technology Development Center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ross&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens263&quot;/&gt;

In September 1952, the Board of Regents requested an audit of EES's financial operation. Of primary concern was the reporting of overhead income, which the Board suspected was inadequate. The audit found discrepancies in the accounts receivable that were attributed to EES's practice of delaying reporting information on receivables by a month, a tactic that had become common to ensure  working capital due the regents' failure to adequately fund the station.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens264&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 264]]&lt;/ref&gt; Though Rosselot denied malfeasance, the practice nonetheless did not conform to the University System of Georgia's established procedures for budget reporting. As a result, Rosselot went on leave from his post at Georgia Tech in November 1952, pending the acceptance of his resignation by the chancellor, which became effective March 1, 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens264&quot;/&gt; Following his resignation, Rosselot soon accepted a position with the [[Bendix Corporation]]'s aviation division.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens265&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 265]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1950, [[Herschel H. Cudd]] was appointed head of EES's Chemical Sciences division.&lt;ref name=&quot;huddnique&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/20100|title=Cudd Joins Experiment station As Chemical Sciences Director|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1950-03-14|accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gerald Rosselot went on leave pending his resignation, Cudd was named acting director of EES in November 1952, then named director in July 1953, and resigned in November 1953 to accept a much higher-paying position at the American Viscoe Corporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;champ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens268&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 268]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he was in the post for only a year, Cudd made far-reaching changes to the station. Under Rosselot, research had been increasingly concentrated on a few researchers; Cudd reversed this trend to the extent that EES's 1952–53 Annual Report stated that 66&amp;nbsp;faculty in 15&amp;nbsp;schools performed research at the station that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;champ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens266&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 266]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cudd created a new promotion system for researchers that is still in use to this day. Many EES researchers held the rank of [[Professors in the United States|professor]] despite lacking a doctorate (or a comparable qualification for promotion as determined by the Georgia Board of Regents), something that irritated members of the teaching faculty. The new system, approved in the spring of 1953, used the Board of Regents' qualifications for promotion and mirrored the academic tenure track.&lt;ref name=&quot;champ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens267&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 267]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cudd spent a significant amount of the EES operating budget on improving laboratory facilities. Cudd's successor [[Paul K. Calaway]], previously director of the School of Chemistry, made a last-minute request to the contract organization in May 1954 to cover the resulting $20,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|20000|1954}}|-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}){{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} deficit.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhwg240&quot;&gt;[[#Wal|Wallace, p. 240]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, a faculty committee appointed to do a comprehensive study of Georgia Tech, &quot;The Aims and Objectives of the Georgia Institute of Technology&quot;, noted that of EES's budget of $2&amp;nbsp;million for 1953–1954 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|2.0|1953}}}}}} million in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}),{{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} about 83% was sponsored by governmental agencies, and about two thirds of that was classified.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens268&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 268]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, the Rich Electronic Computer Center, a new wing on the Hinman Research Building, was dedicated; the project was paid for by $85,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|85000|1955}}|-4}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}){{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} from the Rich Foundation and a matching grant from the EES's contract organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhwg241&quot;&gt;[[#Wal|Wallace, p. 241]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This period saw a significant expansion in Georgia Tech's [[postgraduate education]] programs, which received substantial support from the EES.&lt;ref name=&quot;champ&quot;/&gt; Despite its slow start, with the first [[Master of Science]] programs in the 1920s and the first [[Doctorate]] in 1946, the program became firmly established. In 1952 alone, around 80&amp;nbsp;students earned graduate degrees while working at EES.&lt;ref name=&quot;champ&quot;/&gt;

James E. Boyd was promoted to Assistant Director of Research at the station in 1954, and succeeded Calaway as director on July 1, 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/BOYDJAM.ESE.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912061927/http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/BOYDJAM.ESE.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-12|title=James E. Boyd|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Georgia Tech, Boyd wrote an influential article about the role of [[research institute|research centers]] at [[institutes of technology]], which argued that research should be integrated with education, and Boyd correspondingly involved undergraduates in his research.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd |first1=James E. |year=1957 |title=Research Center in an Institute of Technology |journal=IRE Transactions on Engineering Management |publisher=[[Institute of Radio Engineers]] |volume=EM-4 |issue=3 |pages=99–100 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=5007421 |doi=10.1109/IRET-EM.1957.5007421 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806144921/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=5007421 |archivedate=August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd was known for recruiting faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research; one such example is his recruitment of noted physicist and nuclear scientist [[Earl W.

Under Boyd's purview, the Engineering Experiment Station gained many electronics-related contracts, to the extent that an  Electronics Division was created in 1959; it would focus on radar and communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;boydgtri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-forefathers/dr-james-e-boyd|title=History Makers: Dr. James E. Boyd|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd championed the establishment of research facilities. In 1955, Georgia Tech president Blake Van Leer appointed Boyd to Georgia Tech's Nuclear Science Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyd&quot;/&gt; The committee recommended the creation of a Radioisotopes Laboratory Facility and a large research reactor on campus. The former was built and dedicated on January 7, 1959, and could receive, store, and process radioactive materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyd&quot;/&gt; The [[Neely Nuclear Research Center|Frank H. Neely Research Reactor]] was completed in 1963 and was operational until 1996, when it was defueled due to safety concerns related to the nearby [[1996 Summer Olympics]] events.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyd&quot;/&gt; The reactor was permanently decommissioned in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/markets/nuclear/assets/ProjectPortfolio/ResearchReactor.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yobjrRwa|archivedate=2011-05-20|title=Research Reactor Decommissioning|publisher=[[CH2M HILL]]|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Cold War era, radar and antenna related applications remained a prominent research activity in EES' contracts with the Defense Department.&lt;ref name=graceyears&gt;{{cite web|title=Change at the Top: The Grace Years|work=GTRI Historical Archive|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millimeter wave]] radar research, in particular, was prominent in EES' defense activities from the late 1950s, when the first military-designation millimeter wave radar was built at Georgia Tech, to the 1980s, when GTRI developed what was then the world's highest frequency microwave radar.&lt;ref name=mmradar&gt;{{cite web|title=Millimeter wave radar brings international recognition|work=GTRI Historical Archive|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; EES' high-frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy, meteorology and climate studies, which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in NASA's planning of the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] and [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] missions.&lt;ref name=mmradar/&gt; Expansion of EES' antenna research in the 1970s, in particular, the development of an air defense antenna for the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|U.S. Army Missile Command]], resulted in the establishment of the [[GTRI Applied Systems Laboratory at Huntsville|Huntsville Research Laboratory]], GTRI's oldest off-campus research center.&lt;ref name=graceyears/&gt;

In 1980, EES developed a [[TEMPEST]]-approved version of the [[Apple II Plus]] for [[U.S. Army]] [[FORSCOM]], and used it as a component in the earliest versions of the Microfix system. Fielded in 1982, the Microfix system was the first tactical system using video disk ([[Laserdisk]]) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as [[order of battle]], airfields, roadways, and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://training.esri.com/campus/library/Bibliography/RecordDetail.cfm?ID=16159|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724182533/http://training.esri.com/campus/library/Bibliography/RecordDetail.cfm?ID=16159|archivedate=2011-07-24|title=The development of small computer geographic analysis systems for military applications|publisher=[[Esri]]|authors=Barney W.

On April 10, 1989, GTRI announced that one of its research groups, led by [[James Mahaffey]], had duplicated the results of a controversial [[University of Utah]] experiment that had allegedly achieved [[cold fusion]] in a jar of water.&lt;ref name=graceyears/&gt;&lt;ref name=fusionflaw&gt;{{cite news|last=Broad|first=William|title=Georgia Tech Team Reports Flaw In Critical Experiment on Fusion|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/14/us/georgia-tech-team-reports-flaw-in-critical-experiment-on-fusion.html|date=1989-04-14|accessdate=2012-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days following the announcement, the researchers discovered that the instrument used to measure neutrons was damaged by the heat of the liquid and gave false, elevated readings.&lt;ref name=graceyears/&gt;&lt;ref name=fusionflaw/&gt; GTRI immediately retracted its support of the Utah researchers' findings, citing the flawed measurement.

===Expansion and reorganization===
The Georgia General Assembly amended EES' charter in the early 1960s, authorizing an &quot;industrial extension service to meet the technical, informational and other needs of industry and local development groups&quot;.&lt;ref name=transition&gt;{{cite web|title=A Time of Transition - the 1960s|work=GTRI Historical Archive|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-history/time-transition-1960s|accessdate=2012-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an expansion of some of EES' activities that it had been involved in since the 1940s. In particular, EES began providing additional services as a [[business incubator|technological incubator]] during this time frame, and began an international development initiative that improved infrastructure and facilitated technology transfer in over 40 developing nations.&lt;ref name=transition/&gt; The station's expanded mission bolstered its traditional research strengths, resulting in work on projects that improved radar operation on the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rocket]] and in the invention of the compact antenna range by [[Richard C. Johnson]].&lt;ref name=compactrange/&gt;&lt;ref name=transition/&gt; Throughout the 1960s, these changes brought about an increased focus on research that sought to solve societal problems rather than research for the sake of pure scientific knowledge. This came at a time when director [[Maurice W. Long]] began placing an emphasis on graduate education and multidisciplinary research.&lt;ref name=peoplesake&gt;{{cite web|title=Research &quot;For the Sake of People&quot;: Early Social Entrepreneurs|work=GTRI Historical Archive|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-history/research-%E2%80%9C-sake-people-early-social-entrepreneurs|accessdate=2012-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Boyd at Podium cropped.jpg|thumb|right|James E. Boyd speaking at Georgia Tech.|alt=A man wearing a suit and glasses standing at a podium outside.]]
The late 1960s saw a period of student unrest, and university research centers that worked on contracts for the Department of Defense were often the site of student protests. Neither Georgia Tech nor EES became the focus of protests, and Long attributed this to the school's &quot;conservative student body&quot;.&lt;ref name=peoplesake/&gt; For other reasons, however, EES became embattled financially and politically as a result of cuts in federal and state spending as well as cuts to the space program. Georgia Tech's academic units were similarly affected by these cuts, which helped rekindle the debate over EES' relationship with the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;defend&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-history/ees-defends-its-independence|title=EES Defends its Independence|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia Tech president [[Arthur G. Hansen]]'s &quot;bold and controversial&quot; solution to both entities' problems was to completely absorb the station into Georgia Tech's academic units.&lt;ref name=&quot;defend&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens399&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 399]]&lt;/ref&gt; On paper, this would dramatically increase Georgia Tech's stated research funding (as all of it would be performed through the academic units), and it would increase options and financial aid for graduate students. Another, less publicized, reason was that Georgia Tech would gain access to the contract organization's reserve fund, which was said to be over $1 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1970|r=1}}}} million in {{inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;ens399&quot;/&gt;{{Inflation-fn|US}} [[Thomas E. Stelson]], [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] at Georgia Tech, was named to &quot;reorganize&quot; the station. Publicly, Stelson's task was simply to recommend a plan for reorganization, but the administration clearly intended for Georgia Tech and the Engineering Experiment Station to be closely integrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens399&quot;/&gt; [[Maurice W. Long]], who was director of the station at the time, viewed the move as a violation of the EES's [[charter]] as legislatively established by the [[Georgia General Assembly]] in 1919, and asserted that Georgia Tech did not have the authority to merge the two institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens399&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens400&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 400]]&lt;/ref&gt; EES employees and business executives involved with the station appealed to the [[Georgia Board of Regents]] and to [[Governor of Georgia]] (and future United States President) [[Jimmy Carter]] (himself a Georgia Tech alumnus); the controversy received coverage in both ''[[The Technique]]'' and the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens400&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report of the Director, Engineering Experiment Station|work=Annual Report, 1970–71|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|pages=83–85|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--it's also covered in the following sources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1971-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Atlanta Constitution]]|date=1971-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

When former EES director James E. Boyd was appointed as interim president of Georgia Tech following the departure of Hansen, he stopped the plan for complete absorption of the station, but did allow plans for closer control and more aggressive contract solicitation to proceed.&lt;ref name=&quot;defend&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens400&quot;/&gt; Among these measures were increased resource-sharing, including increased sharing of physical assets and research staff. The latter was evidenced by the increase in joint faculty appointments between the EES and Georgia Tech. The move paid off, and the fiscal year 1970–1971 saw EES win new contracts and grants, totaling a record $5.2 million (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5.2|1971|r=1}}}} million in {{inflation-year|US}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;defend&quot;/&gt;{{Inflation-fn|US}} Stelson was left in charge of the station's reorganization and was named interim director upon Long's departure in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens399&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 399]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whistle&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whistle.gatech.edu/archives/05/dec/05/stelsonobit.shtml|title=Thomas Stelson, emeritus vice president of research, dies|newspaper=''The Whistle''|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]|date=2005-12-05|accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, Stelson reorganized the station into eight semi-autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele, a model it retains (with slight modifications) to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;relevant&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b67PDPCcPIEC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=thomas+stelson+carnegie+mellon#v=onepage&amp;q=stelson&amp;f=false|title=Research and relevant knowledge: American research universities since World War II|first=Roger L|last=Geiger|date=1993-05-06|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|isbn=978-0-19-505346-3|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens401&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p. 401]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Engineering Experiment Station was renamed the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1984. A separate organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, changed its name to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally to the [[Georgia Tech Research Corporation]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens259&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p.259]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ens434&quot;&gt;[[#McM|McMath, p.434]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are legal difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities, especially the federal government, so the second organization is a contracting organization. Most importantly, it allows the university to perform multi-year contracts that are not possible under state law, which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens259&quot;/&gt; The name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with the federal government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ens401&quot;/&gt; GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s: the Centennial Research Building opened on the north end of the Georgia Tech campus in 1985, providing expanded lab and office space, and the electromagnetic radiation measurement range was established at GTRI's Cobb County research facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;

From 1992 to 1997, retired Vice Admiral [[Richard H. Truly]] was GTRI's director.  Truly helped GTRI survive a recession and the end of the [[Cold War]] despite its dependence on [[United States Department of Defense]] (DOD) contracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;truly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/our-forefathers/vadm-richard-h-truly-usn-ret|title=VADM Richard H. Truly (USN, Ret.)|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure the percentage of GTRI's budget from the DOD did experience a small decrease (from 76&amp;nbsp;percent to 70&amp;nbsp;percent), but this was balanced by increased research in other fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;truly&quot;/&gt; In 1997, GTRI passed $100&amp;nbsp;million in research contracts, with 546 awards for $103,061,780 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{roundup|{{Inflation|US-NGDPPC|103061780|1997}}|-5}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;truly&quot;/&gt;{{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC}} One of GTRI's more widely used (and ongoing) products, [[FalconView]], was initially developed in the early 1990s; it is a [[geographic information system]] that allows pilots to plot flight paths while integrating real-time military intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/history/innovations/falconview-keeps-pilots-date|title=FalconView keeps pilots up-to-date|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truly was replaced by [[Edward K.

===Structure===
GTRI is composed of eight [[laboratories]] organized by technical focus into three research and development directorates.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR2014p8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/files/media/GTRI_2014_Annual_Report_Final.pdf|title=2014 Annual Report|page=8|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each lab is further subdivided into [[division (business)|divisions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;labs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/labs|title=Our research laboratories|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labs frequently collaborate with one another and outside groups (both academic units and external companies) based on the requirements of each project.&lt;ref name=&quot;syn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/synergy-with-georgia-tech|title=Synergy with Georgia Tech|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; GTRI performs research for clients at the local, regional, national, and international level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factbook.gatech.edu/content/major-gtri-customerschart |title=Major GTRI Customers |work=Georgia Tech Fact Book |year=2010 |accessdate=2012-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428025230/http://factbook.gatech.edu/content/major-gtri-customerschart |archivedate=April 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and employees are encouraged to publish their work and present it at conferences and consortia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/careers/qualifications|title=Qualifications we seek|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/expert|title=Expert-To-Expert|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osp.gatech.edu/publication/ |title=Publication of Results Generated Under Sponsored Research Projects |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology Office of Sponsored Programs |accessdate=2012-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617075001/http://www.osp.gatech.edu/publication/ |archivedate=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GTRI is an operating unit of Georgia Tech although it performs research under commercial cost principles for non-profit organizations.  For that reason, it uses a separate contracting entity, the Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation (GTARC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtarc.gatech.edu/|title=Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation]]|accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although GTARC is the contracting entity, the [[Georgia Tech Research Corporation]] (GTRC) owns the [[intellectual property]] created by all Georgia Tech researchers and manages technology protection and [[licensing]]. GTRI reports to the Georgia Tech Executive Vice President of Research (as of 2013, [[Stephen E. Cross]]) who currently serves as the President of GTARC.&lt;ref name=&quot;gtarc2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtarc.gatech.edu/financials/gtarc_2010.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yobkTdPH|archivedate=2011-05-20|title=Financial Statements With Independent Auditors' Report For the Year Ended June 30, 2010|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation]]|date=2010-09-17|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GTRI's project directors are responsible for direction of all aspects of projects, including marketing, contract development, research, and fulfillment. Most projects are conducted on a [[reimbursement|cost-reimbursable]] basis and are negotiated by Georgia Tech's Office of Sponsored Programs with terms and conditions appropriate for contracts specific to the operation of a university research organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;gtarc2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/compliance|title=Compliance|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is led by the Director, who is also considered a vice president of Georgia Tech.&lt;ref name=&quot;rschorg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factbook.gatech.edu/administration-and-faculty/organization-chart-e-exec-vice-pres-for-research/|title=Executive Vice President for Research Organization Chart|work=Georgia Tech Fact Book|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]|date=Fall 2013|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five people report to the director: the Deputy Director and Associate Vice Provost for Research;  the Deputy Director for Support Operations; and the three deputy directors in charge of each research and development directorate.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR2014p8&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--new GTRI org chart ref--&gt; The eight lab directors report to their respective deputy director of research and development.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR2014p8&quot;/&gt; The business strategist, financial operations director, and chief scientist all report to the Deputy Director/Vice Provost. Business services, human resources, information systems, machine services, and other support services report to the Deputy Director for Support Operations.&lt;!--new GTRI org chart ref--&gt;

GTRI, like many traditional boards of directors, has an External Advisory Council, which consists of individuals who are notable in related fields of industry, government or academia and who provide advice about research direction, strategy, and markets, although they do not govern the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;eac&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/advisory-council|title=External Advisory Council|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Board of Trustees of the contracting agency, GTARC, are not necessarily members of the External Advisory Council, although there is sometimes overlap between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;eac&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtarc.gatech.edu/trustees/ |title=Trustees |publisher=[[Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation]] |accessdate=2011-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719201318/http://www.gtarc.gatech.edu/trustees/ |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GTRI contributes to the Georgia Tech research environment for [[faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] and students by conducting externally sponsored, applications-oriented research programs that benefit the state, region, and nation. These programs, led by GTRI research faculty, contribute to [[national security]], civilian needs, and industrial competitiveness, and provide students with career experience through [[research assistant|graduate research assistantships]], [[cooperative education]] programs, and undergraduate assistantships. Since 1995, GTRI (and in particular, its [[GTRI Applied Systems Laboratory at Huntsville|Huntsville Laboratory]]) has been a [[University Affiliated Research Center]], a designation by the United States Department of Defense intended to maintain what it calls &quot;essential engineering and technology capabilities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/contract-vehicles|title=Contract Vehicles|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GTRI is the largest single employer of Georgia Tech graduate and undergraduate students; as of 2013, GTRI employed 186 graduate co-ops and research assistants and 128 undergraduate co-ops.&lt;ref name=&quot;gtri-staff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/president/speeches/GTRI75thAnniversary.html |title=GTRI's 75th Anniversary Remarks |publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2011-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203123531/http://www.gatech.edu/president/speeches/GTRI75thAnniversary.html |archivedate=December 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/careers/co-op|title=Co-op Employment|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/careers/student-assistants|title=Student Assistants|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; GTRI's contributions to the Georgia Tech community include collaborative research with academic faculty, [[Course (education)|courses]] originated by GTRI faculty, and joint service efforts. Collaboration is strong between the faculties of GTRI and the academic schools and departments. Many GTRI researchers hold appointments as [[Professor#Other positions|adjunct faculty members]] in Georgia Tech academic departments, serve on [[thesis]] advisory committees, and teach both academic and [[continuing education]] courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;syn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/prof-ed|title=Professional Education|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GTRI reaches out to Georgia Tech's academic and research departments for collaboration on many research activities, building interdisciplinary teams that take advantage of the broad expertise within Georgia Tech's highly ranked programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology | date=2010-08-17 | url=http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?nid=60445 | accessdate=2011-05-12 | title=Georgia Tech's U.S. News Rankings remain strong }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such collaboration is with the [[Georgia Tech Information Security Center]] to create GTRI's newest laboratory, the [[GTRI Cyber Technology and Information Security Laboratory|Cyber Technology and Information Security Laboratory]] (CTISL).&lt;ref name=&quot;war&quot;&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/casestudy/cyber-warriors|title=Cyber Warriors: GTRI Creates Cyber Technology and Information Security Laboratory|date=2010-10-01|accessdate=2010-10-07|publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
