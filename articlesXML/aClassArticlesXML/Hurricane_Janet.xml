'''Hurricane Janet''' was the most powerful [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season]] and one of the strongest [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]]s on record. The eleventh tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and fifth [[Category 3 hurricane|major hurricane]] of the year,{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a storm that ranks as Category&amp;nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale]].&lt;ref name=BASIC&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldenburg, Stan|chapter=A3) What is a super-typhoon?

Moving westward across the [[Caribbean Sea]], Janet fluctuated in intensity, but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane]] with winds of 175&amp;nbsp;mph (280&amp;nbsp;km/h). The intense hurricane later made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] at that intensity near [[Chetumal, Mexico]] on September&amp;nbsp;28. After weakening over the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], it moved into the [[Bay of Campeche]], where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] on September&amp;nbsp;29. Janet quickly weakened over Mexico's mountainous terrain before dissipating on September&amp;nbsp;30.

In its developmental stages, Janet caused $7.8&amp;nbsp;million in damage to the Lesser Antilles and 189&amp;nbsp;deaths in the [[Grenadines]] and [[Barbados]].{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1955&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} While Janet was in the central Caribbean Sea, a [[Hurricane Hunters|reconnaissance aircraft]] flew into the storm and was lost, with all eleven crew members believed to be perished. This remains the only such loss which has occurred in association with an Atlantic hurricane. A Category&amp;nbsp;5 upon landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, Janet caused severe devastation in areas of [[Quintana Roo]] and [[British Honduras]]. Only five buildings in [[Chetumal, Mexico]] remained intact after the storm, and an estimated 500&amp;nbsp;deaths occurred in the [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of Quintana Roo. At Janet's second landfall near Veracruz, significant river [[flooding]] ensued, worsening effects caused by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Gladys (1955)|Gladys]] and [[Hurricane Hilda (1955)|Hilda]] earlier in the month. The floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326&amp;nbsp;people in the Tampico area, leading to the largest Mexican relief operation ever executed by the United States.

Janet's landfall as a Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane on the Yucatán Peninsula was the first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic made landfall on a continental [[mainland]]; prior to Janet, landfalls of Category&amp;nbsp;5 intensity were only known to have taken place on islands.&lt;ref name=Monsters&gt;{{cite web|title=Category 5 MONSTERS!|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/satellite/satelliteseye/educational/cat5hur.html|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 2, 2013|author=National Climatic Data Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janet's minimum [[barometric pressure]], recorded in Chetumal, was at the time the second lowest recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic, behind the [[1935 Labor Day Hurricane]]. At least 1,023&amp;nbsp;deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8&amp;nbsp;million in damages. The name Janet was later [[List of retired Atlantic hurricane names|retired]] from the Atlantic list of tropical cyclone names due to its significance to the scientific research community.

A weak tropical disturbance was first reported by the [[Air France]] and [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] airlines east of the [[Lesser Antilles]] early on September&amp;nbsp;21. Although it was speculated that the disturbance originated from a [[tropical wave]] near [[Cape Verde]], the [[National Hurricane Center|Weather Bureau]] considered the system too weak to be detected due to a lack of [[weather forecasting|reports]] from the islands.&lt;ref name=mwr&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunn, Gordon E.|author2=Davis, Walter R. |author3=Moore, Paul L. |title=Hurricanes of 1955|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=December 1, 1955|volume=83|issue=12|pages=315–326|format=PDF|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1955)083&lt;0315:HO&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/mwr_pdf/1955.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2013|publisher=American Meteorological Society|location=Weather Bureau Office, Miami, Florida |bibcode=1955MWRv...83..315D  }} See pp. 321-323.&lt;/ref&gt; At 1800&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on September&amp;nbsp;21, while it was located 350&amp;nbsp;mi (565&amp;nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Martinique]],{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}&lt;ref name=Janet10&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurricane Janet Tenth of Season|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kUEpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j2YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2750,2029661&amp;dq=janet&amp;hl=en|accessdate=January 21, 2013|newspaper=The Lewiston Daily Sun|date=September 22, 1955|agency=Associated Press|location=Miami, Florida|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the disturbance became sufficiently organized for the Weather Bureau to classify it as Tropical Storm Janet, the tenth named storm of the season.&lt;ref name=Janet10 /&gt;  Upon classification, Janet quickly intensified as it moved to the west.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}&lt;ref name=adv&gt;{{cite report|publisher=United States Department of Commerce|author=United States Weather Bureau|title=Bulletins and Advisories Issued by Weather Bureau Airport Station, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Weather Bureau Office, Miami, Florida, and Weather Bureau Office, New Orleans, Louisiana on Hurricane &quot;Janet&quot;|type=Preliminary Report|pages=1–14|accessdate=January 21, 2013|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/hurricanes/Qc9452j26b81955.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September&amp;nbsp;22, Janet attained hurricane strength, and proceeded to [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensify]] as it moved westward across the [[Windward Islands]].&lt;ref name=mwr /&gt; By 1200&amp;nbsp;UTC that day, Janet already attained [[Category 3 hurricane|Category&amp;nbsp;3 hurricane]] strength with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 120&amp;nbsp;mph (195&amp;nbsp;km/h), before stalling in intensification.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

Shortly after 1700&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;22, the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Janet passed over [[Barbados]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembrance service for Janet's victims |author=Staff writer |url=http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=local&amp;NewsID=12859|newspaper=The Barbados Advocate |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=February 2013 |trans_title= |quote=At the service, it was recalled that the natural disaster struck the island on September 22, 1955.

After passing between the islands of [[Grenada]] and [[Carriacou and Petite Martinique|Carriacou]] in the morning hours of September&amp;nbsp;23, Janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref name=mwr /&gt; As a result, the hurricane became disorganized, with winds weakening to 90&amp;nbsp;mph (145&amp;nbsp;km/h) by 1200&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;23.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}&lt;ref name=mwr /&gt; A [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] reconnaissance plane entered the hurricane early on September&amp;nbsp;24, reporting a lack of organization, and noting an indiscernible center of circulation with weak [[rainbands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; However, the hurricane began to reintensify in favorable conditions, regaining major hurricane strength by 1200&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;24 and subsequently [[Category 4 hurricane|Category 4&amp;nbsp;hurricane]] intensity by the next day.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt;{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

[[File:Hurricane Janet Barograph Chetumal.png|thumb|Graph of barometer readings in Chetumal|alt=Chart showing a line which remains steady and suddenly drops near the center of the graph, representing a drop in barometric pressure, before rising again and steadying out.]]
While trekking across the central Caribbean Sea, Janet was only slightly larger than while it was moving over the Windward Islands, with gale force winds extending 125&amp;nbsp;mi (200&amp;nbsp;km) out from the center by September&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt; Remaining a Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane as it moved erratically westward across the Caribbean, a reconnaissance flight mission during the night of September&amp;nbsp;25–26 indicated strong rainbands with frequent [[lightning]] strikes and a well-defined eye, evidence that the storm was once again rapidly intensifying.&lt;ref name=mwr /&gt; As it neared the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] on September&amp;nbsp;26, Janet began accelerating in forward speed.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt; After the reconnaissance flight ''Snowcloud Five'' was lost while making a penetration into the hurricane's eye, another flight early on September&amp;nbsp;27 reported a minimum pressure of 938&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.70&amp;nbsp;inHg), with winds in excess of 115&amp;nbsp;mph (185&amp;nbsp;km/h) &quot;by a large and incalculable amount.&quot;&lt;ref name=mwr /&gt; The hurricane was estimated to have intensified to [[Category 5 hurricane|Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane]] intensity—the highest rating on the modern day [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale]]—at 1200&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;27, while in the western Caribbean Sea. Janet continued to intensify afterwards, eventually reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 175&amp;nbsp;mph (280&amp;nbsp;km/h),{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} with gale force winds having expanded to at least  250&amp;nbsp;mi (400&amp;nbsp;km) away from the center of the hurricane.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt; Janet maintained peak intensity as it passed over the [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Islands]] before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in extreme southern Quintana Roo, Mexico,  just east of [[Chetumal, Mexico]]. In that city, a [[barometer]] indicated a minimum barometric pressure of 914&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.00&amp;nbsp;inHg) in the eye of Janet.&lt;ref name=mwr /&gt; At the time, this was the second lowest pressure ever recorded on land in a landfalling [[Atlantic hurricane]], behind the [[1935 Labor Day Hurricane]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; though Janet was later surpassed by hurricanes [[Hurricane Dean|Dean]] and [[Hurricane Gilbert|Gilbert]], which also made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula as Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricanes.&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite report|author=Franklin, James L.|date=January 31, 2008|title=Hurricane Dean|work=Tropical Cyclone Report|type=Preliminary Report|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center|accessdate=January 21, 2013|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL042007_Dean}}|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once over land, Janet considerably weakened to a [[Category 2 hurricane|Category&amp;nbsp;2 hurricane]] with winds of 105&amp;nbsp;mph (170&amp;nbsp;km/h). After crossing the Yucatán Peninsula with a forward speed of 21&amp;nbsp;mph (34&amp;nbsp;km/h), the hurricane emerged into the [[Bay of Campeche]] by 1600&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;28.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}&lt;ref name=&quot;adv&quot; /&gt; The weakened hurricane marginally intensified as it crossed the Bay of Campeche to a secondary peak intensity of 110&amp;nbsp;mph (175&amp;nbsp;km/h) with a minimum central pressure of 950&amp;nbsp;mbar (hPa; 28.06&amp;nbsp;inHg).{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Janet eventually made its final landfall 50&amp;nbsp;mi (80&amp;nbsp;km) north of the city of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] by 2200&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;29 as a Category&amp;nbsp;2 hurricane. After moving inland, the hurricane became quickly disorganized due to the highly mountainous terrain of [[Mexico]], and as a result the Weather Bureau issued its last advisory on Janet.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt; The weakening system degenerated to tropical storm strength by September&amp;nbsp;30, and later dissipated over central Mexico by 0600&amp;nbsp;UTC that day.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Janet's remnant circulation contributed to the development of a disturbed area of weather off the western coast of Mexico that would subsequently develop into a [[1955 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical Storm Five|tropical storm]] on October&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt;

==Preparations==

===Caribbean Islands===
Upon Janet's formation east of the Windward Islands, the Weather Bureau office in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] advised [[small craft advisory|small craft]] to remain in port and vessels in the path of the developing storm to exercise caution. After a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested, [[hurricane warning]]s were issued at 1600&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;22 for the entirety of the Lesser Antilles from [[Saint Lucia]] to Grenada, including Barbados. [[Storm warning]]s were issued for all islands in the Windward Islands from Saint Lucia south to [[Tobago]], excluding [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. All warnings in the Windward Antilles remained in effect until 1000&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;22. Shortly after warnings were lowered in the Windward Islands, storm warnings were issued for the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] and the [[Paraguaná Peninsula]] of [[Venezuela]] at 0200&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;23. After Janet passed north of the islands, all storm warnings were lifted on the morning of September&amp;nbsp;25. The Weather Bureau later warned interests in Jamaica, but did not issue any hurricane-related warnings for the island.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt;

===Yucatán Peninsula and Mexico===
The Weather Bureau first began cautioning areas of [[Central America]] at 1600&amp;nbsp;UTC on September&amp;nbsp;26, advising people in areas of northeast [[Nicaragua]] and [[Honduras]] to take precautionary measures, along with all vessels and small craft in the [[Gulf of Honduras]] south to [[Cabo Gracias a Dios]]. After Janet began accelerating towards the west-northwest, advisories warned areas in [[British Honduras]] and [[Quintana Roo]] of hurricane-related impacts. Though no official warnings were issued for areas of Central America, advisories published by the Weather Bureau cautioned interests in the hurricane's path up until landfall.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt; Evacuations took place in several coastal towns in Quintana Roo upon notification of the oncoming storm. People were evacuated to inland hillside shelters.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt; After the hurricane moved through the Yucatán Peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, the Weather Bureau alerted areas in the storm's path on the western side of Mexico's Gulf Coast. At the time, Janet was expected to make landfall between Veracruz and [[Tuxpan, Veracruz|Tuxpan]]. Areas were warned of the storm's potential flooding and coastal impacts. The Weather Bureau advised all small craft south of [[Port O'Connor, Texas]] to remain in port. Notifications of Janet to potentially affected areas were stopped after the hurricane made landfall.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt;

During its existence, areas of the [[Lesser Antilles]], ABC islands, and Central America were affected by Janet.&lt;ref name=adv /&gt; At least $65.8&amp;nbsp;million in damages and 1,023&amp;nbsp;deaths were caused by the hurricane, mostly in Quintana Roo.&lt;ref name=mwr /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakatoon Smash&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=EMDAT /&gt; The large number of deaths and damage caused by Janet helped make the 1955&amp;nbsp;Atlantic hurricane season the deadliest and costliest hurricane season documented since comprehensive record of such statistics began in 1942.&lt;ref name=mwr /&gt;

As a small but rapidly intensifying hurricane, Janet passed just south of Barbados on September&amp;nbsp;22, becoming the first hurricane to strike the island in 57&amp;nbsp;years, since the [[1898 Windward Islands Hurricane]]. Maximum sustained winds on the south side of the island were estimated to be between 110–120&amp;nbsp;mph (180–190&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; The strong winds knocked out communication lines, preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island,&lt;ref name=Smash /&gt; though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and [[amateur radio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;High Damage&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Damage High on Island as Hurricane Janet Hits|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DuZXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sfYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2476,621598&amp;dq=janet&amp;hl=en|accessdate=January 24, 2013|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|date=September 23, 1955|volume=70|issue=1|agency=Associated Press|location=Spokane, Washington|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric power was later restored, allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heavy Loss&quot; /&gt; [[Sugar cane]], the island country's main source of revenue, was severely damaged, with losses estimated to be in excess of $1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Smash&gt;{{cite news|title=Janet's Winds Smash Island|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7lUaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qiYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7336,4062631&amp;dq=janet&amp;hl=en|accessdate=January 24, 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=September 22, 1955|volume=73|agency=Associated Press|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds.&lt;ref name=Whirling /&gt; An estimated 8,100&amp;nbsp;homes were damaged by the hurricane.&lt;ref name=CDMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurricanes &amp; Tropical Storms|url=http://www.weready.org/CDM/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=18|publisher=The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency|accessdate=January 25, 2013|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destroyed buildings and trees blocked [[highway]]s,&lt;ref name=Whirling&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurricane Janet Whirling Westward|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wg5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=auIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6785,4081384&amp;dq=janet&amp;hl=en|accessdate=January 24, 2013|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=September 23, 1955|volume=89|issue=265|agency=Associated Press|location=Eugene, Oregon|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Grantley Adams International Airport|Seawell Airport]] was forced to close.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homeless Sentinel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Janet' Hits Barbados, Thousands Homeless|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=glQxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6g8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1548,2033949&amp;dq=janet&amp;hl=en|accessdate=January 24, 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=September 22, 1955|agency=Associated Press|location= Milwaukee, Wisconsin|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy rains peaked at 4&amp;nbsp;in (100&amp;nbsp;mm) and a [[storm surge]] of 7&amp;nbsp;ft (2.1&amp;nbsp;m) swept away low-lying houses along the coast.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|last=Longshore|first=David|title=Encyclopedia of hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones|year=2008|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8160-6295-9|edition=New|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 2,000&amp;nbsp;people were left homeless due to the hurricane.&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 Homeless&quot; /&gt; Property damage on Barbados was estimated to be $5&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 Homeless&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurricane Force Wanes, 2000 on Isle Homeless|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D-ZXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sfYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2467,770720&amp;dq=christ+church+on+barbados&amp;hl=en|accessdate=January 24, 2013|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|date=September 24, 1955|volume=70|issue=2|agency=Associated Press|location=Spokane, Washington|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 57&amp;nbsp;people were killed.&lt;ref name=EMDAT&gt;{{cite web|title=Search Details Disaster List|url=http://www.emdat.be/search-details-disaster-list|publisher=Emergency Events Database|accessdate=January 24, 2013|author=SuperAdminEMDAT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it approached the Yucatán Peninsula, Janet passed over the Swan Islands north of Honduras as a Category&amp;nbsp;5 hurricane on September&amp;nbsp;27.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} The hurricane caused rough seas, and strong winds uprooted trees and [[antenna (radio)|antennas]].

====British Honduras====
Making landfall near the border between Mexico and British Honduras, the latter colony's [[Corozal District|Corozal]] and [[Orange Walk District|Orange Walk]] [[Districts of Belize|districts]], containing a population of 15,500&amp;nbsp;at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30%&amp;nbsp;of all trees had been damaged, especially [[mahogany]] and [[Manilkara zapota|sapodilla]] trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631&amp;nbsp;million in damages. [[Fruit tree]]s, [[maize]], and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was expected to have a 20%&amp;nbsp;decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. [[Pineapple]] crops and [[livestock]] experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the [[Belize District]] and several of British Honduras' offshore [[cay]]es. Similar to Corozal and Orange Walk Districts, corn, trees, and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop.&lt;ref name=Belize-Report&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurricane Janet : Progress report no. 1 (27th/28th September, 1955)|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00095346/00001/pdf|publisher=University of Florida Digital Collections|accessdate=January 26, 2013|date=November 11, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;
