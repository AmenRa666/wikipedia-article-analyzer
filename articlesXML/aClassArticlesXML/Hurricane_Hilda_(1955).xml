'''Hurricane Hilda''' was a strong [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 3]] [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] that was the second in a succession of three hurricanes to strike near [[Tampico]], [[Mexico]]. The eighth [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season]], Hilda formed from a [[tropical wave]] on September&amp;nbsp;10 near the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It quickly intensified while moving westward into a small hurricane, and it crossed over southeastern [[Cuba]] on September&amp;nbsp;13. There, it dropped heavy rainfall and produced gusty winds that destroyed 80% of the coffee crop in [[Oriente Province]]. In the eastern Cuban city of [[Baracoa]], Hilda severely damaged the oldest church in the country. Damage totaled $2&amp;nbsp;million in Cuba, and there were four deaths. Later, the hurricane moved across the Caribbean Sea, causing light damage in the sparsely populated region of the eastern [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. 

After reaching the Gulf of Mexico, Hilda strengthened to reach peak winds of 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h) late on September&amp;nbsp;18. Before the hurricane moved ashore, there was residual flooding in Tampico from earlier [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Gladys|Hurricane Gladys]]. Hilda struck the city early on September&amp;nbsp;19, with gusts estimated at {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. It dropped heavy rainfall that flooded 90% of Tampico, while its strong winds damaged half of the homes, leaving 15,000&amp;nbsp;homeless. The storm killed 300&amp;nbsp;people and caused over $120&amp;nbsp;million (1955&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in Mexico. Ongoing flooding caused an outbreak of [[dysentery]], and about 10&amp;nbsp;days after Hilda struck, [[Hurricane Janet]] struck the same region and caused further flooding and damage. Collectively, the damage from the storms represented about half of Mexico's budget in 1955.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Hilda 1955 track.png}}
The origins of Hurricane Hilda were from an [[tropical wave|easterly wave]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;&gt;{{cite report|author=Gordon E. Dunn|author2=Walter R. Davis|author3=Paul L. Moore|title=Hurricanes of 1955|publisher=United States Weather Bureau|page=320|accessdate=January 20, 2013|date=December 1955|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1955.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spawned a tropical depression over the northern [[Lesser Antilles]] late on September&amp;nbsp;10.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} By the next day, the system was producing winds of {{convert|46|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in squalls.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim&quot;/&gt; After moving to the northwest, it turned more to the west and quickly intensified.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} On September&amp;nbsp;12, Hilda attained hurricane status to the north of the [[Mona Passage]] between [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. It was a small cyclone, and the strongest winds were in a small region around the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; Hilda continued to the west about {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} offshore northern [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;clim&quot;/&gt; After reaching winds of 100&amp;nbsp;mph (160&amp;nbsp;km/h), the hurricane weakened slightly while off the north coast of [[Haiti]]. Turning to the west-southwest, Hilda made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near the southeastern tip of [[Cuba]] on September&amp;nbsp;13. While crossing the island into the [[Caribbean Sea]], it weakened from a hurricane into a tropical storm.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

On September&amp;nbsp;14, Hilda emerged into the Caribbean Sea. It quickly re-intensified, surpassing its previous strength to winds of {{convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} by September&amp;nbsp;15.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} The hurricane weakened slightly as it neared the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], and Hilda struck the sparsely populated area between [[Chetumal]] and [[Cozumel]] on September&amp;nbsp;16 with winds of about {{convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; It weakened slightly over the Yucatán Peninsula, emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on September&amp;nbsp;17 with winds of about 100&amp;nbsp;mph (160&amp;nbsp;km/h). Hilda again re-intensified, reaching its [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&amp;nbsp;mph (205&amp;nbsp;km/h) late on September&amp;nbsp;18.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Early the next day, the hurricane made landfall near [[Tampico, Tamaulipas]] in northeastern Mexico. Winds in the city reached {{convert|105|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and the eye was observed for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes. The lowest pressure in Tampico was {{convert|952|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} on September&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; Hilda rapidly weakened over land, turning to the west-southwest and dissipating on September&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt;

==Impact==
Early in its duration, the storm produced winds of {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on [[Grand Turk Island]]. Its threat prompted a [[small craft advisory]] for southern Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=United Press|title=Naval Base in Path of Hurricane|newspaper=The Times-News|date=September 13, 1955|accessdate=January 20, 2013|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BUIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hyMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4098,4024197&amp;dq=hurricane+cuba&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the southern Bahamas, and Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;day&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|title=Hurricane Loses Its Punch|date=1955-09-14|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=January 20, 2013|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C4oeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fcsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2365,1661728&amp;dq=hurricane+cuba&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hilda struck southeastern Cuba, it caused moderate damage and killed four people,&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; all of whom in [[Oriente Province]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sara&quot;/&gt; Wind gusts reached {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]],&lt;ref name=&quot;day&quot;/&gt; which caused a brief power outage.&lt;ref name=&quot;tol&quot;/&gt; High waves washed a freighter ashore along Cuba's north coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;day&quot;/&gt; Strong winds severely damaged the church in [[Baracoa]], which was built in the 16th century and was the oldest in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;sara&quot;/&gt; In [[Santiago de Cuba]], Hilda produced heavy rains and gusty winds, which knocked down telephone lines and caused flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;tol&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurricane Loses Force in Cuba|date=September 14, 1955|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Toledo Blade|accessdate=January 20, 2013|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gZ5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mgAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7314,4182212&amp;dq=hurricane+cuba&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five people were injured after houses collapsed in the city.

Before the hurricane struck, residents in Mexico expected that Hurricane Hilda would be weaker and strike near Tampico. When the storm was announced via radio about three hours before landfall, most people were already asleep and unable to prepare.&lt;ref name=&quot;asa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Así es Tampico|title=1955, the year that marked Tampico's History|accessdate=January 20, 2013|url=http://www.asiestampico.com.mx/ap_552.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tides rose in advance of the storm, and before it made landfall, 10% of Tampico was still flooded from previous [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Gladys|Hurricane Gladys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|title=Ione is Bypassing Florida|agency=Associated Press|date=September 18, 1955|accessdate=January 20, 2013|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DooeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fcsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=683,2178066&amp;dq=hurricane+yucatan&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tampico, Hilda's strong winds blew away an anemometer after the instrument recorded winds of {{convert|105|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}; peak winds were later estimated at around {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; At the city's port, Hilda damaged boats and ferries, some of which washed out to sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;asa&quot;/&gt; The hurricane destroyed the roofs of about half of the city's houses, as well as several schools and large buildings. Hilda produced severe flooding in Tampico that was reported to have covered 90% of the city's streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim&quot;/&gt; Although smaller than the previous Hurricane Gladys, Hilda dropped heavy rainfall that flooded local rivers. Overall, 11,432&amp;nbsp;people were directly affected by Hilda.&lt;ref name=&quot;asa&quot;/&gt; The hurricane caused 300&amp;nbsp;deaths and $120&amp;nbsp;million in damage, mostly due to the flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwr&quot;/&gt; 

After the storm, Tampico was left without power or communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;asa&quot;/&gt; About 15,000&amp;nbsp;people became homeless due to the storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas declared a state of emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or telephone. Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|date=September 20, 1955|title=Hilda Leaves 15,000 Homeless, 12 Dead, 350 Hurt in Tampico|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|accessdate=January 20, 2013|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M95LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3ooDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4489,1088530&amp;dq=hurricane+hilda&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rail line from [[Laredo, Texas]] to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Floods Delay Reports of Janet's Mexico Toll|agency=Associated Press|date=September 30, 1955|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=January 21, 2013|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hngcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5GQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4051,70280&amp;dq=hurricane+hilda&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of [[dysentery]] that killed two children.
