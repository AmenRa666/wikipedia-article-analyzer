According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}

With the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]], the municipality is now part of [[Manila]]'s conurbation which reaches [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan|San Ildefonso]] in its northernmost part.

Located on the banks of the [[Santa Maria River (Philippines)|Santa Maria River]], {{convert|32|km|mi|1}} north of [[Manila]], Santa Maria has been a thriving settlement for almost four centuries. It was founded as a ''[[barrio]]'' of [[Bocaue]] in the early [[17th century]] until it was established as an independent municipality on November 26, 1793 by the [[Spanish Friars in Colonial Philippines|Spanish friar]] Francisco Dominguez Javier [[Franciscan|OFM]]. Known before as ''Santa Maria de Pandi'' ({{IPA-tl|pɐnˈde}}), it is named under the patronage of the [[Virgin Mary|Immaculate Conception]] (also known as La Purisima Concepcion). Santa Maria's ancient core, the [[Poblacion]], is surrounded by four rivers and it still largely retains its 2.88 square-kilometer boundaries since the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish Colonial Era]].

Santa Maria, with a population of 256,454, remains by a significant margin the most populous [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] in [[Central Luzon]], as well as the [[List of Philippine cities and municipalities by population|5th most populous]] municipality in the [[Philippines]]. Its downtown area, known as the Santa Maria Central Business District, consists of three (3) highly urbanized barangays: Poblacion, [[Bagbaguin, Bulacan|Bagbaguin]], and [[Santa Clara, Bulacan|Santa Clara]]. It is one of the biggest and busiest commercial centers in the province as it accounts for more than half of all economic activities in the municipality. It is also one of Bulacan's leading financial centers. According to the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (BSP) and the [[Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (PDIC), Santa Maria's total bank deposits reached [[Philippine Peso|PHP]] 17.3 billion as of June 2016, this accounts for almost 75% of eastern [[Bulacan]]'s total bank deposits and dwarfing other cities and municipalities in the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pdic.gov.ph/files/BSDStats/DDD_PBS_ProvinceMunicipality.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Santa Maria is the richest municipality in [[Bulacan]] with an assets totaling to [[Philippine Peso|PHP]] 873 million and revenues reaching an all-time high of [[Philippine Peso|PHP]] 533 million as of the 2015 report from the [[Commission on Audit of the Philippines|Commission on Audit]] (COA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units/2015/category/5798-municipalities&lt;/ref&gt; It has a relatively high standard of living, with only 4% of the population living in poverty which is one of the lowest in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/2012%20SAE_final_1.xlsx&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Santa Maria with a score of 42.1807 was ranked second among all municipalities in the country in the overall Municipalities Competitiveness Index issued by the National Competitiveness Council of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Maria was the home town of [[José Corazón de Jesús]], a Filipino poet popularly known as &quot;''Huseng Batute''&quot;, who started composing his verse as a child.  Another native of Santa Maria is [[Francisco Santiago]], a composer who wrote &quot;''Nasaan Ka Irog''&quot; and other kundiman songs. In the political arena, Santa Maria has produced three [[Governor of Bulacan|Bulacan governors]]: Jose Serapio (1900-1901), Trinidad Icasiano (1912-1916), Fortunato Halili (1943-1944 and 1946-1951); and two representatives of the [[Legislative districts of Bulacan|second]] and [[Legislative districts of Bulacan|fourth district]]: Rogaciano Mercado (1953-1992) and [[Reylina Nicolas]] (2001-2010).

== Etymology ==

Santa Maria got its name from the Immaculate Conception (also known as La Purisima Concepcion).

== History ==

=== Pre colonial (before 1521) ===

Before the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] came to the [[Philippines]], Santa Maria was just a vast wilderness, inhabited by wild animals and covered by thick and lush rainforests. [[Aeta people|Aetas]] and Dumagats are also known to inhabit the place a long time ago.

=== Spanish Era (1521–1898) ===

Santa Maria's existence can be traced as early as the year 1647 when it is still a ''barrio'' (village) of [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]]. The ''barrio'' was believed to be established on the same period when the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] founded the vast Hacienda de Lolomboy that extends up to the [[Angat, Bulacan|Angat river]] on the north, [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue river]] on the west, [[Marilao, Bulacan|Marilao river]] on the south and the Pulo River (Pulong Buhangin) on the east.

Santa Maria was founded as an independent town by the [[Franciscan]] Fray Francisco Dominguez Javier on November 26, 1793. He began constructing the church which was completed in the early 1800s by Fray Tomas Marti. The construction of the church was viewed as the foundation of the spiritual crusade in the said locality. Natives were converted into [[Christianity]] and more people began to inhabit the place. Civil affairs started to take shape and the appointment of the first Capitan del Barrio, Andres dela Cruz, paved way for the permanent establishment of Poblacion, which was the seat of [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial government. People in those days were just renting their pieces of land. They paid their rents to the friars who were stationed in what is now known as [[Santa Clara, Bulacan|Santa Clara]], a barangay where at present one can see the ruins of a big convento of friars. People from other nearby places such as  [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]], [[Pandi, Bulacan|Pandi]], Santa Maria, and [[San Jose del Monte]], paid their rents in this convento. Santa Maria at that time was then called &quot;Santa Maria de Pandi&quot;. The people acquired their lands after paying certain sum to the friars and the land became &quot;Lupang Tagalog&quot;.

There where 82 capitanes who served the Spanish colonial administration from 1793 to 1899.

=== American Era and Japanese Occupation (1898–1946) ===
Under the Americans, the title &quot;captain&quot; was changed to &quot;presidente&quot;. The first to hold the position was Maximo Evidente, who served from 1899 to 1900. Of the 12 others who succeeded him, the most popular were Agustin Morales (1928–34) and Fortunato F. Halili (1934–37). Morales was responsible for the construction of the first main water system in the town. Halili, who never drew his salary as executive, later on became Governor of Bulacan. It was during Halili's term as  provincial governor when the Capitol building at [[Malolos, Bulacan|Malolos]] was heavily damage due to the aftermath of [[World War II]]. He decided to take over and resurge Casa Real de Malolos as a temporary Gubernatorial Office during the period when the Capitol building was severely damaged. It was his effort to rebuild and to reconstruct the Capitol building into its original structure.

During the Japanese Occupation, Dr. Teofilo Santiago, dubbed as ''Dr. Kamoteng Kahoy'' for his widespread campaign among the town's citizenry to plant cassava, became mayor of Santa Maria. Santiago was also responsible for the launching of the poultry industry – a livelihood project which earned for the town the distinction of being &quot;The Egg Basket of the Philippines&quot;. He was also the &quot;Father of Santa Maria Dairy Plant&quot;. After the Liberation, Capitan Ireneo Hermogenes was appointed Municipal Mayor from March 20, 1945 to October 1945. He was succeeded by Marciano Bautista.

From the American colonial rule until the restoration period after World War II, Santa Maria was administered by 12 Presidentes from 1899 to 1937 and 4 Alcaldes from 1938 to 1947.

=== Liberation period (1947–present) ===
The post-liberation period saw Conrado Ignacio as the first elected Mayor of Santa Maria (1947–1955). He was succeeded by prominent personalities in Santa Maria local politics such as Ricardo G. Nicolas Sr. (1956–1959/1964–1967), Eriberto Ramos, Sr. (1960–1963), Paulino M. Luciano Sr. (1968–1971), Ricardo D. Nicolas, Jr.(1972–1978) and Paulino Luciano, Jr. (1979–1986).

After the [[People Power Revolution]] in February 1986, President [[Corazon Aquino]] appointed Dr. Alfredo Perez, who was then the vice-mayor of the town, as Officer-in-Charge of the municipality until May, 1986, when he was replaced by Ricardo Nicolas, Jr. In December 1986, however, Nicolas was appointed OIC Vice Governor of Bulacan and was succeeded by Benjamin G. Geronimo (1987–1988) and Atty. Ramon H. Clemente (1988).

During the 1988 elections, Eriberto Ramos was elected Mayor and served until June 30, 1992. On July 1, 1992, he was succeeded by Reylina G. Nicolas. Her three terms of leadership gave the municipality various awards and citations. In July 1, 1993, the municipality rose from third class to second-class municipality and July 1, 1996, the income level of the municipality rose again from second-class municipality to first-class municipality. In the 2001 elections, Nicolas ran for Representative of the 4th Congressional District of Bulacan and won a landslide victory with more than 80,000 votes over her closest rival. Nicolas was succeeded by [[Bartolome Ramos|Bartolome R. Ramos]].

During the 2004 elections, Jesus Mateo defeated the incumbent Ramos and became mayor of the municipality until 2007. One of Mateo's accomplishments as mayor of Santa Maria was the establishment of the [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Santa Maria|Polytechnic University of the Philippines]] – Santa Maria extension campus in 2005.

During the 2007 elections, [[Bartolome Ramos|Bartolome R. Ramos]] defeated the incumbent Mateo and became mayor of the municipality again. Under his administration, Santa Maria became the richest municipality in [[Bulacan]] for the first time in its history in 2008 surpassing the high-income municipalities of [[Marilao, Bulacan|Marilao]], [[Norzagaray, Bulacan|Norzagaray]], and [[Baliuag, Bulacan|Baliuag]]. In the 2010 and 2013 elections, voters in Santa Maria overwhelmingly elected him as the chief local executive.

[[File:SantaMariaWelcomeArch.jpg|thumb|250px|Santa Maria Welcome Arch]]
Due to its location near [[Metro Manila]], rainfall and climate in Santa Maria is almost similar to the country's capital [[Manila]]. The location of Santa Maria in the western side of the [[Philippines]] made [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAG-ASA) to classify its weather scheme as ''Type I''. Wind coming from the Pacific Ocean is generally blocked by the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre mountain range]], a few kilometers east of the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=http://kidlat.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/cab/statfram.htm|publisher=Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its proximity to the equator tends to make its temperature to rise and fall into very small range: from as low as {{convert|19|C|F}} to as high as {{convert|35|C|F}}. The [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate system]] classifies Santa Maria climate as [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon (''Am'')]] due to its location and precipitation characteristics. This means that the municipality has two pronounced seasons: dry and wet seasons. The municipality's driest months are from November to April where it receives less than {{convert|60|mm|in}} of rainfall. On the other hand, maximum rain period is from June to September where it receives not more than {{convert|600|mm|in}} of rainfall. Hail and snow is not observed in the municipality.

[[Relative humidity|Humidity]] levels are usually high in the morning, especially during June to November, which makes it feel warmer. Lowest humidity levels are recorded in the evening during wet season. Discomfort from heat and humidity is extreme during May and June, otherwise it is higher compared to other places in the country. Average sunlight is maximum at 254.25 hours during April and minimum at 113 hours during July, August and September.

[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is the dominant religion with 91%&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Website of Santa Maria, Bulacan 1&quot;&gt;[http://www.santamariabulacan.gov.ph/about/religion.asp Official Website of Santa Maria, Bulacan; Religion]&lt;/ref&gt; of the populace professed themselves as Roman Catholics. Santa Maria is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos. There are seven parishes and one quasi-parish in Santa Maria namely: Immaculate Conception – Poblacion, Santa Maria, Bulacan; Our Lady of Mt. Carmel – Pulong Buhangin, Sta. Maria, Bulacan; Sto. Niño – Parada, Sta. Maria, Bulacan; St. Gabriel the Archangel – San Gabriel, Sta. Maria, Bulacan; Holy Family – Catmon, Sta. Maria, Bulacan; St. John the Evangelist – Bagbaguin, Sta.

These subdivisions used to occupy the stretch of the roads but now they are now developing the inner portions of their [[barangay]]s. It is expected that within the next ten years, land use development in Santa Maria will represent the sub-urban mix which means that the government will provide development where the level of accessibility is very high. This will provide for the clustering of lower density land uses to help meet housing, employment and public services needs of the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Website of Santa Maria, Bulacan 2&quot;&gt;[http://www.santamariabulacan.gov.ph/about/residential.asp Official Website of Santa Maria, Bulacan; Residential]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GovFFHaliliAvenue.jpg|thumb|[[Fortunato Halili Avenue|Governor Fortunato F. Halili Avenue]] in [[Bagbaguin, Bulacan|Bagbaguin]] is the busiest highway in the municipality.]]

Santa Maria is one of the municipalities in Bulacan with a high population growth rate due to in migration. Its rapid population growth contributes largely to the establishment of more commercial and trading activities as some people see this as an opportunity for business. In 2004, the registered business totalled to 4,042 with employment size of 6,168 individuals. The number just got better in 2005 as the registered businesses rose to '''5,754''' and the employment size to 18,968 individuals. Today there are more than 30 banking and financial institutions in Santa María. These include commercial, savings and rural banks.

The public market at Poblacion and the private market in Pulong Buhangin are the major areas for the exchange of goods and services. Commercial spaces are being developed in barangays Bagbaguin, Cay Pombo, Pulong Buhangin, and Parada to provide the needs of more residents from various barangay.

In 2005, majority of the establishments were those engaged in retail trading. Retail trading employed more than 83 percent of the total employed in commercial establishments and occupied 69 percent of the area devoted to commerce and trade.

High population growth rate in Santa Maria triggers the expansion of commercial activities. The expansion is expected to answer the demand for product and services of the increasing populace. Commercial strips are being developed in strategic locations such as those where the concentration of population is located. Aside from Poblacion, commercial strips can be found in Barangay Bagbaguin where a major food chain, a major food market, three (3) restaurants, retail stores, and service establishments operate. Other barangays like [[Pulong Buhangin, Bulacan|Pulong Buhangin]], Cay Pombo, [[Guyong, Bulacan|Guyong]], and Parada are also having a commercial strip. The increment in the number of registered businesses was attributed to the perceived effect of the campaign of the municipal government to register all businesses for efficient business tax collection.

Commercial and trade exchange areas in Santa Maria are considered as a ''Central Business District''. In Poblacion, the Public Market serves the needs of the people in the municipality.  With an area of 1.5 hectares, the public market is home to about 500 stalls offering various commercial products both wet and dry.  Further, it is complemented by shops and offices as well as recreational and transportation facilities like jeepney and tricycle terminals scattered around the Poblacion. Such transportation facilities are essential to the transport of goods.

[[Pulong Buhangin, Bulacan|Pulong Buhangin]] is another minor central business district located in the northern portion of Santa Maria because of the private market and presence of numerous commercial establishments.

[[Bagbaguin, Bulacan|Bagbaguin]] is also an urban barangay where radial strips for commercial uses are situated because of its strategic location being adjacent to Poblacion.  Major food shops like Max’s restaurant, supermarkets like [[Puregold]], and commercial banks are operating in this barangay. Complementing these establishments is the municipality’s pride like Nic’s Ihaw-Ihaw and Green Pond Restaurant.

On March 3, 2003, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] issued Presidential Proclamation No. 337 designating the Santa María Industrial Park as a Special Economic Zone (Ecozone).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santamariabulacan.gov.ph/business/default.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial activities in Santa María are mostly agro-based. For the past two decades, there has been a great boom in its poultry and hog raising industries. Presently, there are around more than 150 poultry and piggery farms.

The town fiesta of Santa Maria in honor of its Patroness, the Purisima Concepcion is a month-long celebration in February which clearly shows the Marian devotion of the town. The movable feast is held on the Thursday after February 2 which tradition refers to as La Candelaria. It is preceded by the traditional novena of Masses before the feast and High Masses and processions on the Sundays of the month.

For the visperas, over a dozen brass bands enters the town towards the Poblacion from Bagbaguin in the morning. A la torre or homage of the bands to the Virgin at twelve noon and a parade of all the bands on the streets of the Poblacion in the afternoon. In the evening, the church patio is filled with people for the Serenata. On the day of the Fiesta itself, the Misa Pontifical or concelebrated Mass is the highlight of the Masses which begins at dawn and is followed by the procession of the Purisima in the morning and in the evening. The High Masses and Processions are repeated during the succeeding Sundays.

Throughout the month several other events are held such as musical variety shows led by popular personalities, outdoor sports exhibitions of nationally acclaimed players, concerts by well known bands and cultural shows.

Most notable during the month of February is the availability of the famous &quot;''Tuge''&quot;, a ready to eat root crop sold by vendors that signify the ambiance of the festivity together with the cool breeze which last right after the celebration of the town fiesta.

The joyous celebration of February takes on a somber mood as the liturgical calendar moves on to Cuaresma or Lent. In Santa Maria, the solemn commemoration begins not on Palm Sunday but a week before that. The Church of La Purisima Concepcion holds the annual Solemne Septenario or seven-day devotion in honor of La Virgen Esperanza. It ends on Viernes de Dolores or the Friday before Palm Sunday. The highlight of the feast is the Misa Pontifical followed by the besamanos or kissing of the Virgin's hand in the morning and the Procession of the Virgen Macarena under palio in the evening which is known as Via Matris. During this procession, the Virgin makes seven stops to specific houses and high up on a balcony, a tenor and a soprano sing the dialogue of Christ and the Virgin. They are assisted by a choir and a brass band.

Apparently, the devotion was brought by the Franciscans who evangelized the town where the principal celebrations before the War was celebrated at the Lourdes Church which was then in Intramuros. Lost during the War, it was revived by the Hermandad y Cofradia de la Sagrada Pasion y de Maria Santisima de la Esperanza, a confraternity organized in 1999 to spearhead the revival and promotion of the Lenten traditions of Santa Maria from the Jubilee Year 2000 onwards. Incidentally, the Hermandad de la Sagrada Pasion has been an affiliate of the Hermandad de la Macarena in Seville, Spain since 2008 making it the twenty first confraternity to be recognized, the second outside of Spain and the first in Asia.

The procession of Holy Wednesday and Good Friday features close to forty pasos de misterios or carrozas and draws a huge crowd as spectators and participants as heirlooms images and newly commissioned ones are brought out. What sets it apart from other Semana Santa processions in the province is not so much the number of carrozas, but the solemnity and decorum on how it is done. The Hermandad de la Sagrada Pasion is the first in the province to have initiated the narration of the passion in dramatized form as the pasos are brought out to the streets. This is a rite that was eventually copied by the rest of the towns in Bulacan.

=== Pavilion ===
Within the heart of Santa Maria is a new pavilion that was built and completed on February 2006. It is now the central pillar of all happy family celebrations that catered to all its citizen and neighboring town folks. Its famous name &quot;Casa Burgos&quot; was derived from one of the three famous Spaniard friars collectively known as &quot;[[Gomburza]]&quot;, which was also the origin of an old street's name in Santa Maria, namely Padre Burgos Street (now C. Ignacio Street). Visitors and guests are awed by its lush and beautiful garden setting that became the focal point of most garden weddings and the likes. A place to visit when you are in Santa Maria, Bulacan.
