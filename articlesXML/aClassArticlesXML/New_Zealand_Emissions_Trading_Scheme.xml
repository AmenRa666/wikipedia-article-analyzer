The '''New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme''' (NZ ETS) is a partial-coverage all-free allocation uncapped highly internationally linked [[emissions trading scheme]]. The NZ ETS was first legislated in the [[Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008]] in September 2008 under the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand]]&lt;ref name=&quot;parker08&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/historic+climate+change+legislation+passes

The NZ ETS covers forestry (a net sink), energy (42% of total 2012 emissions), industry (7% of total 2012 emissions) and waste (5% of total 2012 emissions) but not pastoral agriculture (46% of 2012 total emissions).&lt;ref name='snapshot'&gt;{{cite web

Individual sectors of the economy have different entry dates when their obligations to report emissions and surrender emission units take effect.

The NZ ETS is highly linked to international carbon markets as it allows the importing of most of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] emission units. It also creates a specific domestic unit; the 'New Zealand Unit' (NZU), which will be issued by free allocation to emitters, with no auctions intended in the short term.&lt;ref name='unit'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/emissions-trading-scheme/about/emission-units.html |title=New Zealand Units (NZUs) |work=Climate change information New Zealand |publisher=Ministry for the Environment, NZ Government (www.climatechange.govt.nz) |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2010 |quote=In the short term, the Government is unlikely to sell emission units because the Kyoto units allocated to New Zealand will be needed to support New Zealand’s international obligations, as well as allocation to eligible sectors under the emissions trading scheme.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free allocation of NZUs will vary by sector. The commercial fishery sector (who are not participants) will receive a free allocation of units on a historic basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;MfESept09&quot;/&gt; Owners of pre-1990 forests will receive a fixed free allocation of units.&lt;ref name=&quot;forest&quot;/&gt;  Free allocation to emissions-intensive industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/node/17690 |title=Who will get a free allocation of emission units? |work=Questions and answers about the emissions trading scheme |publisher=Ministry for the Environment, NZ Government |accessdate= 15 May 2010  |date= 14 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='ag'&gt;{{cite web |author=MfE |url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate/emissions-trading-bulletin-11/index.html#agriculture |title=Agriculture |work=Summary of the proposed changes to the NZ ETS - Emissions Trading Bulletin 11 |publisher=Ministry for the Environment, NZ Government |accessdate=16 May 2010 |date=September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; will be provided on an output-intensity basis.

Some stakeholders have criticized the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme for its generous free allocations of emission units and the lack of a carbon price signal (the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;pce1&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0910/S00231.htm |title=New bill ‘weakens ETS’ says Environment Commissioner|publisher=Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=15 October 2009 |quote=The allocation of free carbon credits to industrial processes is extremely generous and removes the carbon price signal where New Zealand needs one the most}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for being ineffective in reducing emissions ([[Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;greenpeace&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0909/S00153.htm |title=Revised ETS an insult to New Zealanders |date=14 September 2009 |publisher=Greenpeace New Zealand |accessdate=12 October 2009 |quote=We now have on the table a pathetic ETS which won’t actually do anything to reduce emissions }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NZ ETS was reviewed in late 2011 by an independent panel, which reported to the public in September 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETSreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/emissions-trading-scheme/ets-review-2011/statement-for-consultation.html |title=Issues statement for public consultation |work=NZ ETS Review 2011 |publisher=Ministry for the Environment

==Economics==
{{See also|economics of climate change mitigation}}

===Pricing the externality===
An emissions trading scheme for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) works by establishing [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] for the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;{{cite book |year=1996 |contribution=Introduction: scope of the assessment. |title=Climate Change 1995: Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor=J.P. Bruce ''et al'' |publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K., and New York, N.Y., U.S.A. |isbn=978-0-521-56854-8 |doi=10.2277/0521568544|author=Goldemberg, J.  |displayauthors=etal  |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmosphere is a global [[public good]], and GHG emissions are an international [[externality]] (p.&amp;nbsp;21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the '''cap-and-trade''' variant of emissions trading, a limit on access to a resource ('''the cap''') is defined and then allocated among users in the form of permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits '''traded''' within the '''cap'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tietenberg03&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tom |last=Tietenberg |title=The Tradable-Permits Approach to Protecting the Commons: Lessons for Climate Change |url= http://oxrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/19/3/400?ijkey=324rjCyD25Jfk&amp;keytype=ref  |journal= Oxford Review of Economic Policy |volume= 19  |issue=3 |pages=400–419 |year=2003 |accessdate= |doi=10.1093/oxrep/19.3.400}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental integrity of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.&lt;ref name='Driesenelaw40'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Capping Carbon |url=http://www.elawreview.org/elaw/401/capping_carbon.html |author=David M. Driesen |journal=Environmental Law |volume= 40 |issue= 1  |pages= 1–55 |quote=Setting the cap properly matters more to environmental protection than the decision to allow, or not allow, trades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficiency and equity===
For the purposes of analysis, it is possible to separate [[economic efficiency|efficiency]] (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and [[equity (economics)|equity]] (fairness).&lt;ref&gt;Goldemberg ''et al.''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full [[margin (economics)|marginal]] [[social cost]]s of their actions).&lt;ref&gt;Goldemburg et al, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;29,&amp;nbsp;37&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Goldemburg et al, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share the costs and benefits of reducing future climate change ([[climate change mitigation|mitigation]] of climate change), or the costs and benefits of [[climate change adaptation|adapting]] to any future climate change (see also [[economics of global warming#Paying for an international public good|economics of global warming]]).

===Carbon leakage===
A domestic ETS can only regulate the emissions of the country having the trading scheme. In this case, GHG emissions can &quot;leak&quot; ([[carbon leakage]]) to another region or sector with less regulation (p.&amp;nbsp;21). Leakages may be positive, where they reduce the effectiveness of domestic emission abatement efforts. Leakages may also be negative, and increase the effectiveness of domestic abatement efforts (negative leakages are sometimes called spillover) (IPCC, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2007 |author= IPCC |contribution= Glossary A-D |url= http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/annex1sglossary-a-d.html |title=Annex I: Glossary |series=  Climate Change 2007: Mitigation.

Metz|publisher=  Print version: Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K., and New York, N.Y., U.S.A.. This version: IPCC website |accessdate=25 August 2010|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[carbon tax]] applied only to developed countries might lead to a positive leakage to developing countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;27–28). However, a negative leakage might also occur due to technological developments driven by domestic regulation of GHGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2007 |contribution= Executive Summary  |title=  Mitigation from a cross-sectoral perspective |series=  Climate Change 2007: Mitigation. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor=  B.

===Competitiveness risks===
One way of addressing carbon leakage is to give sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=March 2009 |author=Carbon Trust
|contribution=Memorandum submitted by The Carbon Trust (ET19) |series=Minutes of Evidence, Tuesday 21 April 2009. |title=The role of carbon markets in preventing dangerous climate change  |publisher=UK Parliament House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee.

|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acts as a [[subsidy]] for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]] as it considered there were no circumstances that justify it and that governments could deal with market failure or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits.&lt;ref name='garnaut'/&gt; The economically efficient option would, however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=22 February 2009 |author=Neuhoff, K. |contribution= Memorandum submitted by Karsten Neuhoff, Assistant Director, Electric Policy Research Group, University of Cambridge |series=Written evidence |title=The role of carbon markets in preventing dangerous climate change |publisher= UK Parliament House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee.

A problem with border adjustments is that they might be used as a disguise for trade [[protectionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=3 August 2009 |title=Climate Policy and Industrial Competitiveness: Ten Insights from Europe on the EU Emissions Trading System |journal=Climate Strategies |accessdate=14 April 2010 |url=http://www.climatestrategies.org/our-reports/category/17/204.html|author=Grubb, M.  |displayauthors=etal  |page =5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of border adjustment may also not prevent emissions leakage.

===Issuing the permits: 'grandfathering' versus auctions===
Tradable emissions permits can be issued to firms within an ETS by two main ways: by free allocation of permits to existing emitters or by auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=2007 |contribution=Section 13.2.1.3 Tradable permits |title=Chapter 13: Policies, instruments, and co-operative arrangements |series= Climate Change 2007: Mitigation. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editor=B. Metz ''et al'' |publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K., and New York, N.Y., U.S.A. |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch13s13-2-1-3.html  |accessdate=10 July 2010 |author=Gupta, S.  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allocating permits based on past emissions is called &quot;grandfathering&quot; (Goldemberg ''et al.''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;38). Grandfathering permits, just like the other option of selling (auctioning) permits, sets a price on emissions. This gives permit-liable polluters an incentive to reduce their emissions. However, grandfathering permits can lead to [[perverse incentive]]s, e.g., a firm that aimed to cut emissions drastically would then be given fewer permits in the future. Allocation may also slow down technological development towards less polluting technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1996 |contribution=An Economic Assessment of Policy Instruments for Combating Climate Change. |title=Climate Change 1995: Economic and Social Dimensions of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |editors=J.P. Bruce ''et al.'' |publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K., and New York, N.Y., U.S.A. |isbn=978-0-521-56854-8 |doi=10.2277/0521568544|author=Fisher, B.S.  |displayauthors=etal  |page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]] noted that 'grandfathered' permits are not 'free'. As the permits are scarce they have value and the benefit of that value is acquired in full by the emitter. The cost is imposed elsewhere in the economy, typically on consumers who cannot pass on the costs.&lt;ref name='garnaut'&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.garnautreview.org.au/chp14.htm#14_3 |contribution=Releasing permits into the market |title=The Garnaut Climate Change Review  |publisher=Cambridge University Press   |isbn=978-0-521-74444-7 |accessdate=28 April 2010  |year=2008 |first=Ross |last=Garnaut }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, profit-maximising firms receiving free permits will raise prices to customers because of the new, non-zero cost of emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lawrence H. |last=Goulder |first2=William A. |last2=Pizer  |title=The Economics of Climate Change |year=2006 |series=DP 06-06 |publisher=Resources for the Future |url=http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-06-06.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second method of &quot;grandfathering&quot; is to base allocations on current production of economic goods, rather than historical emissions. Under this method of allocation, government will set a benchmark level of emissions for each good deemed to be sufficiently trade exposed and allocate firms units based on their production of this good. However, allocating permits in proportion to output implicitly subsidises production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-04-37.pdf |title=Output-based allocation of emissions permits for mitigating tax and trade interactions |year=2007 |journal=Land Economics |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=575–599 |last=Fischer |first=C |last2=Fox |first2=A |accessdate=10 August 2010 |quote=However, there often are important trade-offs in terms of efficiency because OBA implicitly subsidizes production, unlike conventional lump-sum allocation mechanisms like grandfathering. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garnaut considers that any method for free permit allocation will have the disadvantages of high complexity, high transaction costs, value-based judgements, and the use of arbitrary emissions baselines.&lt;ref name='garnaut'/&gt;

On the other hand, auctioning permits provides the government with revenues. These revenues could be used to fund low-carbon investment, and also fund cuts in [[distortion (economics)|distortionary]] [[tax]]es. Auctioning permits can therefore be more efficient and equitable than allocating permits (Hepburn, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;236–237).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hepburn2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=2006 |title=Regulating by prices, quantities or both: an update and an overview |author=Hepburn, C. |journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy |volume=22 |issue=2 |doi=10.1093/oxrep/grj014 |url=http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/members/cameron.hepburn/Hepburn%20(2006,%20Oxrep)%20Regulation%20by%20P%20or%20Q.pdf |pages=226–247 |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater transparency and accountability and lower implementation and transaction costs as governments retain control over the permit revenue.&lt;ref name='garnaut'/&gt;

Such recycling of revenue from permit auctions could offset a significant proportion of the economy-wide social costs of a cap and trade scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavins2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert N. |last=Stavins |title=Addressing climate change with a comprehensive US cap-and-trade system |journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy |year=2008 | volume = 24  | issue = 2 24: |pages=298–321 |doi=10.1093/oxrep/grn017 |url= http://oxrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/2/298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as reducing tax distortions, Kerr and Cramton (1998) note that auctions of units are more flexible in distributing costs, they provide more incentives for innovation, and they lessen the political arguments over the allocation of [[economic rents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kerr |first= Suzi |last2= Cramton |first2= Peter |year= 1998 |title=Tradable Carbon Permit Auctions: How and Why to Auction Not Grandfather |work=Discussion Paper dp-98-34 |publisher=Resources For the Future.

===Lobbying for free allocation===
According to Hepburn (2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;238–239),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hepburn2006&quot;/&gt; “it should be expected that industry will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn ''et al.'' (2006) state that it is an empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits.&lt;ref name=&quot;cp6.1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal   | last = Hepburn | first =Cameron J | last2 = Neuhoff | first2 =Karsten  | last3 = Grubb  | first3 =Michael | last4 = Matthes  | first4 = Felix  | last5 = Tse  | first5 =  Max  | title = Auctioning of EU ETS Phase II allowances: why and how? | journal = Climate Policy  | volume = 6  | issue = 1 | pages = 137–160 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/183630/1/eprg0621.pdf  | accessdate = 19 May 2010 | doi=10.3763/cpol.2006.0608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive [[rent-seeking]] behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.&lt;ref name='garnaut'/&gt;

===New Zealand allocation===
In respect of the 2009 amendments to the NZ ETS, intensity-based allocation was favoured over allocations based on historical emissions by business groups, and representatives of large emitters,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallow&quot; /&gt; by [[Fonterra]]&lt;ref name='hell'&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Fallow |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/kyoto-protocol/news/article.cfm?c_id=244&amp;objectid=10570390

===Economic modelling===
In June 2009, Nick Smith released an economic modelling report on the NZ ETS by economic consultants [[New Zealand Institute of Economic Research|NZIER]] and Infometrics which had been prepared for the [[Emissions Trading Scheme Review Committee]]. Smith stated that the report supported the Government's intention to modify the NZ ETS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0906/S00211.htm  |title = Economic analysis supports modified ETS |publisher= New Zealand Government |date= 17 June 2009 |accessdate= 30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report ''&quot;Economic modelling of New Zealand climate change policy&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;ria&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/documents/economic-modelling-of-new-zealand-climate-change-policy/economic-modelling-of-new-zealand-climate-change-policy.pdf |format=PDF |title= Economic modelling of New Zealand climate change policy |last= Stroombergen |first= A  |last2= Schilling |first2= C |last3= Ballingall |first3= J |publisher= NZIER &amp; Infometrics |date= 20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; created static [[computable general equilibrium]] (CGE) models using 2008 emissions projections. The terms of reference set the policy options to look at as the 2008 NZETS vs the least-cost option for meeting the Kyoto liability vs a revenue-neutral tax on carbon equivalents.

The impacts of the various options were estimated as the differences between a carbon tax and a reference ‘business as usual’ scenario assuming New Zealand had not signed the Kyoto Protocol. The variables changed in the model runs were the NZ carbon price ($0, $10, $25 or $100), the world carbon price, the duration (short term to 2012, long term to 2025), the level of free allocation and whether the Government assumed all Kyoto liabilities. The results of each model run was reported as the percent difference from the 'no-Kyoto' ‘business as usual’ scenario in 2012 or 2025.&lt;ref&gt;''Stroombergen et al'' 2009, p 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The report noted several limitations of [[computable general equilibrium]] models that should be kept in mind in interpreting the results: CGE models are only an approximation of highly complex real economies, results can only ever be indicative,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stroombergen et al 2009, p 16&quot;&gt;''Stroombergen et al'' 2009, p 16&lt;/ref&gt; and are highly dependent on the structure of the models and the input assumptions and on the assumption that other variables remain constant. Therefore, the &quot;interpretation of CGE results should centre on their direction (up or down) and broad magnitude (small, medium or large), rather than on the precise point estimates that the model produces&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stroombergen et al 2009, p 16&quot;/&gt;

The report's bolded conclusion was that a narrow carbon tax or trading scheme was the least cost option in the short-term .&lt;ref&gt;''Stroombergen et al'' 2009, p 40&lt;/ref&gt; Predicted reductions in GHG emissions ranged from 0% (Government pays), 0.4% to 2.8% for a $25 carbon price and 3% to 4% for a $50 price.&lt;ref&gt;''Stroombergen et al'' 2009, Table 17, p 38&lt;/ref&gt; However, the report noted that there was little difference in costs between the government paying all and the ETS with free allocation, as all the model results indicated small reductions (-0.1% and -0.4%) in Gross National Disposable Income compared to ‘business as usual’.&lt;ref&gt;''Stroombergen et al'' 2009, p 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==First version of the emissions trading scheme, 2008==
{{main|Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008}}

===Background===
In 2002, the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand]] adopted the [[Climate Change Response Act 2002]] (the Act) in order for New Zealand to ratify the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and to meet obligations under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/climate.html |title=Climate Change Response Act  |publisher=[[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Ministry for the Environment]] |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour's emissions trading scheme===
In 2008, the Labour Government enacted the [[Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008]] which added the first version of the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme to the Climate Change Response Act 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccret&quot;/&gt;

The proposed scheme covered all six greenhouse gases specified in the Kyoto Protocol and was intended to progressively apply to all sectors of the economy including agriculture. 'Participants' (who would account for their emissions) were to be few, and high in the production chain of each sector. Their compliance obligation would have been to surrender one New Zealand unit (NZU) or one internationally tradable Kyoto-compliant unit for each tonne of emissions.

New Zealand units were to be capped in number and were to be allocated to participants either by grandparenting (gifting) or auctioning. Sectors of the economy were to have progressively entered the NZ ETS, with forestry the first from January 2008 and agriculture last in January 2013. Allocation rules varied between sectors. In general, participants who could pass on costs of the ETS, such as fuel companies, would not be allocated free units. Participants such as exporters with products that are priced internationally, would be allocated free units.&lt;ref name='banquet'&gt;{{cite speech |first=David|last=Parker |authorlink=David Parker (New Zealand politician) |url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/new+zealand+emissions+trading+scheme |title=A New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, Speech at Banquet Hall, Parliament Buildings, Wellington |date=20 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609133802/http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/new-zealand-emissions-trading-scheme |archivedate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0709/S00350.htm |title= New Zealand emissions trading scheme Questions and answers |date= 20 September 2007  |accessdate=  18 August 2012 |publisher=New Zealand Government }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest owners with pre-1990 forests were to receive a fixed one-off free allocation of units. Transport (liquid fossil fuels), stationary energy and industrial processes would not receive a free allocation of units. Trade-exposed industries would have received a free allocation of 90% of 2005 emissions annually to 2018. From 2019 to 2029 the free allocation of units would have phased out at the rate of a 1/12 (8.3%) reduction each year. Agriculture would have received a free allocation of 90% of 2005 emissions each year to 2018. From 2019 to 2029 the free allocation would have phased out at the rate of a 1/12 (8.3%) reduction each year. Fishing would have received a free allocation based on 50% of 2005 emissions each year from July 2010 to January 2013.&lt;ref name='fact16' /&gt;

The Labour Government subsequently lost the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 New Zealand election]] to the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|coalition led by National Party]], who had campaigned on amending the NZ ETS.

==The amendments of 2009==

===History===
In December 2008, the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|National-led Government]] set up the [[Emissions Trading Scheme Review Committee]] to review the NZ ETS. The committee provided a report nine months later on 31 August 2009.

In early September 2009, [[Rod Oram]]  predicted that the National Government's goals would be; to adopt intensity-based allocation of free carbon credits to export industries; have no cap on greenhouse gas emissions; to have a temporary cap on the price of carbon; to delay bringing in sectors into the NZETS; to delay phasing out free emission units; and, maximum alignment with the Australian [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]]. Oram viewed these changes as significantly weakening the incentives to reduce emissions and to plant carbon forests.&lt;ref name='bar'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/2837990/Burn-after-reading | title=Burn after reading |first= Rod |last=Oram |work= The Sunday Star Times  |date= 6 September 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2009, the National Government Minister for Climate Change Issues [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]] announced that it had reached an agreement with the [[Māori Party]] about revisions to the NZ ETS and that an amending bill would be drafted in order to &quot;make the ETS workable and affordable&quot;.&lt;ref name='smith1'&gt;{{cite press release |first=Nick |last=Smith|authorlink=Nick Smith (New Zealand politician) |url=http://beehive.govt.nz/release/revised+ets+balances+nz%E2%80%99s+environment+amp+economy |title=Revised ETS balances NZ's environment &amp; economy |publisher=New Zealand Government Media Release |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2009, the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Bill had its first reading in Parliament and was sent to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee for public submissions.&lt;ref name='bill'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/7/a/d/00DBHOH_BILL9597_1-Climate-Change-Response-Moderated-Emissions-Trading.htm |title=Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Bill |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |date=7 December 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee===

===Absence of a cap on emissions===
In 2007, the [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Ministry for the Environment]] released a detailed report &quot;''The Framework for a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme''&quot; which stated the NZ ETS would not have a binding, absolute limit on the total level of emissions allowed in New Zealand. While the quantity of domestic NZ Units gifted to eligible emitters would be fixed, the quantity of international 'Kyoto-compliant' units that could be imported in to match emissions would not be limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= MfE |url= http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate/framework-emissions-trading-scheme-sep07/html/page6a.html |title=The Framework for a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme - 4 Core Design Features |chapter= 4.8.2 Definition of the cap for the NZ ETS |publisher=Ministry for the Environment |accessdate=18 July 2010 |date=September 2007 |series=Ref. ME810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, as there is no limit on the volume of international emissions units (CERs and ERUs) that may be imported, there is no cap or limit on the volume of emissions permitted in New Zealand provided that emissions units are imported into the country and surrendered. In that respect, the NZ ETS is unlike most other emissions trading schemes,&lt;ref name='Moyes'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moyes |first= Toni E. |year= 2008 |title= Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading in New Zealand: Trailblazing Comprehensive Cap and Trade |journal= Ecology Law Quarterly |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages= 911–966. |url = http://www.boalt.org/elq/documents/elq35-4-05-moyes-2009-0309.pdf |quote= Unlike most other ETS, the NZ ETS places no limit on the volume of CERs and ERUs that may be imported (p 936) |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministry for the Environment Fact Sheet 16 stated &quot;There is no cap on the emissions that occur within New Zealand.&quot; However, the Ministry for the Environment still regarded the NZ ETS as operating within the cap on emissions established by the Kyoto Protocol for the first commitment period of 2008–2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact16&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=MfE |url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate/emissions-factsheets/factsheet-16.html  |title=Major design features of the emissions trading scheme |work=Factsheet 16 INFO 318 |publisher=Ministry for the Environment |date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moyes (2008) describes this as a &quot;flexible cap&quot; where New Zealand sourced emissions regulated by the NZETS are constrained only by the international market price for GHG emissions.&lt;ref name='Moyes'/&gt;

Nick Smith's press release of September 2009 announced that the method of allocation of NZ units to trade exposed and emissions intensive firms would now be based on average industry production, where the levels of units allocated would vary in proportion to a firm's production.&lt;ref name='smith1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='summ'&gt;{{cite book |contribution=Summary of ETS Changes |url= http://beehive.govt.nz/sites/all/files/1_Summary_of_ETS_Changes.pdf |work=Factsheet accompanying Media Release by Nick Smith, Minister for Climate Change Issues |title=Revised ETS balances NZ's environment &amp; economy |author=MfE |date=14 September 2009 |publisher=New Zealand Government |accessdate=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In combination with the unlimited use of internationally sourced Kyoto units, the allocation of New Zealand units to eligible emitters in proportion to their production means that there is no cap on total emissions within New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;bull12&quot;/&gt;

There is also no cap on total emissions during the transition period as the Government will supply the market with unlimited New Zealand units at the fixed price of NZ$25 per NZU.

When the NZETS included a proposed free allocation of units to agriculture, there were no eligibility tests. Allocations to agricultural activities were to have been made on an intensity basis. The baseline would have been the sector average emissions per unit of output.

===Allocation of NZ Units to trade-exposed activities===
Under the NZ ETS, all NZ Units are distributed into the market by free allocation (gifting). In 2010, the Ministry for the Environment stated that there was no intention in the short term to auction any NZ Units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/emissions-trading-scheme/about/emission-units.html |title=About emission units |work=New Zealand Climate change information |publisher=Ministry for the Environment (www.climatechange.govt.nz) |accessdate=7 August 2010 |date=10 June 2010 |author=MfE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  'Emissions-intensive' and 'trade-exposed' (EITE) activities are designated a benchmark level of emissions per unit of production.  For example, x amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per tonne of steel. Firms then receive an allocations based on their expected production of the emissions intensive good.

This method of allocation is often referred to as 'intensity based allocation'. Intensity based allocations are allocations that are based on the volume of production of a firm.&lt;ref name=&quot;gpvsi&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.afse.fr/docs/congres2006/docs2006/Demailly.doc | first = Damien | last = Demailly | first2 =Philippe  | last2 =Quirion | title = CO2 abatement, competitiveness and leakage in the European cement industry under the EU ETS: Grandfathering vs. output-based allocation | year = 2006 | accessdate = 12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allocations are given at the beginning of the period and then balanced at the conclusion to reflect actual output.

The benchmark (or allocative baseline) for free allocation for firms considered emissions-intensive and trade-exposed includes compensation for electricity price increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The cost of free allocation of units to emitters is a highly contentious subject. The Sustainability Council argued that the allocation of units to industry is highly costly to taxpayers.&lt;ref name=&quot;terrybert&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainabilitynz.org/docs/ETSBillToAFutureGenerationNov09.pdf| title=ETS: Bill to a Future Generation | last= Terry | first=Simon|publisher = Sustainability Council| date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Christina Hood, a climate change and energy policy consultant, submitted to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee that the use of uncapped intensity based allocation of units will result in a taxpayer subsidy to emitters of about $NZ105 billion up to 2050.&lt;ref name=&quot;hood&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title =Submission to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee on the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Bill |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/6C882B6B-0972-4EFF-A0F6-EB5D5789FB19/115616/49SCFE_EVI_00DBHOH_BILL9597_1_A14707_DrChristinaHo.pdf | publisher = Dr Christina Hood | date = 14 October 2009 | accessdate = 15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Geoff Bertram estimated that at a carbon price of $NZ50 a tonne, the cost to taxpayers of the free allocation of NZ units to emitters will be $NZ99 billion between 2010 and 2091.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertram&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Geoff |last= Bertram |url= http://ips.ac.nz/events/downloads/2009/Copenhagen%202/Geoff%20Bertram%20-%20How%20Not%20to%20Design%20an%20Emissions%20Trading%20Scheme.pdf |title=How Not to Design an Emissions Trading Scheme |publisher= The Institute of Policy Studies, Victoria University of Wellington |date=13 November 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Smith's Cabinet Paper noted that the [[New Zealand Treasury]] had estimated that the long-term costs of intensity-based allocation of units to industry and agriculture would be 'very significant', in the order of $NZ900 million per annum by 2030.&lt;ref name=cabinet&gt;{{cite web |title=Amendments for a Moderated NZ ETS and Second Order Amendments to the Climate Change Response Act

The Clerk of the House invited Economist Dr Suzi Kerr to give independent specialist advice on the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Bill. Kerr's advice was that the free allocation of emission units significantly raised the overall cost of the NZ ETS to the economy and transferred it to taxpayers.&lt;ref name=&quot;suzikerr2&quot;&gt;{{citation |first=Suzi |last=Kerr

The 2009 legislation did not include a specific sunset clause to change the allocation of units to firms that undertake emissions-intensive and trade-exposed activities. The legislation stipulates that allocations must be reviewed no less than once every 5 years by a review panel. In late 2009, Climate Change Minister Nick Smith stated that estimates of fiscal impacts beyond 2020 at the present time are meaningless as there are simply too many unknowns.&lt;ref name=&quot;nzh1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last= Fallow |first=Brian |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/carbon-trading/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501831&amp;objectid=10609738 |title=$50b rise in ETS costs 'shows process too rushed'|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=2 February 2010 |date=17 November 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tgtD1cGX  |archivedate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the level of allocation per unit of output for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industrial activities decreases at 1.3% per year from 2013, as production may increase, allocations may also increase over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;pce-sub&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Wright | first = Jan | title = Submission to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Bill | url =http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/C2BE71F6-AF44-46C9-B5E0-A215C6EC4D74/115918/49SCFE_EVI_00DBHOH_BILL9597_1_A14959_Parliamentary.pdf | publisher = [[Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment]] | date = 13 October 2009 | accessdate =11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transitional assistance===
The NZ ETS contains special transitional provisions from 1 July 2010 (when fossil emissions enter the scheme) until 31 December 2012 (transition period). This end date coincides with the end date of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Although transitional measures are legislated to end after 2012, the Government has suggested that they will be extended in the event that major trading partners such as the USA and Australia do not implement emissions trading schemes of their own before then.&lt;ref name=&quot;delayfulltrading&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wbcsd.org/Plugins/DocSearch/details.asp?ObjectId=MzgxNjY | title =NZ says to delay full CO2 trading if no international progress | publisher=New Zealand Business Council for Sustainable Development | date=8 April 2010 | accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the transition period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction on the sale of units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.&lt;ref name=&quot;MfESept09&quot;/&gt;

===Delayed entry for agricultural emissions===
Agricultural emissions, methane from enteric fermentation and manure management as well as nitrous oxide from animal effluent and fertiliser, were to enter the scheme on 1 January 2015. A 'Questions and Answers' fact sheet released by [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]] (Minister for Climate Change Issues) stated that the delayed entry was due to the difficulties in measuring and monitoring agricultural emissions and the limited technologies available for reducing emissions in the sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;/&gt;

The economic modelling conducted by NZIER and Infometrics stated:
{{cquote|If the aim of climate change mitigation policies is to change producers’ behaviour, it is vital to be able to measure emissions in a cost effective manner. If the transaction costs of measuring emissions outweigh the benefits of emissions reduction, the policy may not be net welfare enhancing. Therefore the transaction costs of implementing an all-sectors all-gases ETS need to be evaluated. It may be advisable to exempt sectors such as agriculture where measurement costs are high relative to the benefit that would be gained from that sector’s inclusion. Our modelling suggests that, in the short term, such exemptions do not reduce economy wide welfare.||| ''Stroombergen et al'' 2009&lt;ref name='ria'/&gt;}}

The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment considered that there was insufficient evidence to justify leaving agriculture out of the NZ ETS until 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;pce-sub&quot;/&gt; A submission from the [[Institute of Policy Studies (New Zealand)]] and The New Zealand Climate Change Research Institute considered that the delayed entry of agriculture into the NZ ETS would reduce long term competitiveness of the New Zealand economy by supporting industry that can not compete in an emissions constrained world.&lt;ref name=IPS-NZCCRI&gt;{{Cite web | last =Bertram | first = Geoff | last2 = Barrett | first2 = Peter

==The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009==

===Adoption===
On 25 November 2009, the bill had its second and third readings&lt;ref name=&quot;smith251109&quot;/&gt; and it was adopted by 63 votes to 58, with the support of the National Party (58 votes), the Maori Party (4 votes) and United Future (1 vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=NZ Science Media Centre |date=26 November 2009 |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC0911/S00059.htm |title= Divisive ETS legislation passed |accessdate= 30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party (43 votes), the Greens (9 votes), ACT (5 votes) and the Progressive Party (1 vote) voted against the third reading.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfy&quot;/&gt;

On 7 December 2009, the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 received the royal assent.&lt;ref name='bill'/&gt;

===Technical Details===
The Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2009 established an emissions trading scheme with obligations on emissions from all sectors and all gases.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith251109&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;See [http://beehive.govt.nz/sites/all/files/1_ETS_Questions_Answers.pdf ETS Questions Answers], [http://beehive.govt.nz/sites/all/files/1_Summary_of_ETS_Changes.pdf Summary of ETS Changes], factsheets accompanying New Zealand Government Media Release by Nick Smith, Minister for Climate Change Issues, 'Revised ETS balances NZ's environment &amp; economy' , 14 September 2009. Retrieved 22 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2015, the technical details can be summarised as:
* All emissions from all sources will have obligations. This includes emissions from biological sources such as methane from enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide from animal effluent.
* Allocations will be made to firms who undertake activities that are deemed to be both 'trade-exposed' and 'emissions-intensive'. Moderately emissions intensive activities will receive allocations equal to 60% of the industry average for the financial years ending 2007, 2008 and 2009. Highly emissions intensive industries will receive allocations equal to 90% of the industry average for this period. Allocation per unit of output will decrease by 1.3% per year from 2013 (on an exponential basis rather than a summation basis).
* As allocations are based on production levels, allocations are not 'capped' at any specific level.
* Moderately emissions intensive activities are those that produce more than 800 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per million dollars of revenue. Highly emissions intensive activities are those that produce more than 1600 tonnes per million dollars of revenue.
** Electricity generators will not receive allocations, however a firm may receive allocation for electricity use if it conducts an 'emissions intensive' and 'trade exposed' activity (EITE).
** Liquid fossil fuel is excluded from allocation in all instances.
* Owners of forests planted after 31 December 1989 are able to 'opt-in' to the scheme and receive units for forest sequestration. If these forests are removed from the land the owner must repay these units.
* Owners of land that was in forest on 1 January 1990 and remained in forest on 1 January 2008 must surrender emissions units if they wish to deforest land AND change the land use to a use other than forestry.
* Agricultural activities will automatically receive a 90% allocation per unit of production, phased out at a rate of 1.3% per year from 2016.

===Sector entry dates obligations and allocations===
The proposed sector entry dates, obligations and unit allocation terms of National's proposed NZ ETS are set out in the table below.&lt;ref name=&quot;MfESept09&quot;/&gt;

|}

===Units able to be traded===
The NZ ETS created a specific domestic emission unit for use in New Zealand, the New Zealand Unit (NZU). The NZUs are not a [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]] unit in terms of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, and can only be surrendered or traded within New Zealand. Assigned amount units (AAUs) issued by New Zealand under the Kyoto Protocol can be also used by emitters to meet their surrender obligations, but assigned amount units issued by other Annex B countries may not be used.&lt;ref name='eur'&gt;{{cite web

|title=Guide to Emissions Returns - SEIP and LFF sectors — New Zealand Emission Unit Register 
|author= NZEUR
|publisher= New Zealand Emissions Unit Register 
|date= December 2011
|quote=Section 18CB of the Climate Change Response Act 2002 prohibits the use of imported AAUs for compliance purposes.  No imported AAUs can be surrendered for NZ ETS compliance purposes as there are no regulations creating an exception to the prohibition.  
|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in the NZ ETS are also able to purchase and surrender international [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]] units such as [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs), [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs) and [[Removal Units]] (RMUs) issued in other countries. Unlike most other emissions trading schemes the NZ ETS has no limit on the volume of international units (CERs and ERUs) that may be imported.&lt;ref name='Moyes'/&gt;  Consequently, the NZ ETS is highly linked to the international market for greenhouse gas emission units. This degree of linkage and the lack of a national cap on emissions makes New Zealand a price-taker where control of the price of emissions to firms is relinquished to the international markets.&lt;ref name='Moyes'/&gt;

During the transition phase (July 2010 to December 2012), only the forestry sector will be able to convert the NZUs allocated to them to [[Assigned amount units]] that can be sold to overseas buyers.&lt;ref name='unit'/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MfE&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=MfE | title = Which international units will be accepted for surrender in CP1? | work = Emissions trading bulletin No 11 | publisher = Ministry for the Environment (MfE), NZ Government | date = September 2009| url = http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate/emissions-trading-bulletin-11/index.html#other | quote= A: There are no changes to the types of units that will be accepted into the NZ ETS (ie, CERs, ERUs and RMUs will be accepted) | accessdate = 18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, temporary CERs and iCERS cannot be used in the NZ ETS, and neither can CERs and ERUs generated from nuclear projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MfE |url= http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate/emissions-factsheets/factsheet-27.html |title= Units of trade in the New Zealand emissions trading scheme |work= Factsheet 27 INFO 329 |publisher= Ministry for the Environment |accessdate= 15 July 2010 |date= October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 23 December 2011, [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units (CERs) from [[Fluoroform|HFC-23]] and [[Nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) industrial gas destruction projects were banned from use in the NZ ETS, unless they had been purchased under future delivery contracts entered into prior to 23 December 2011. The use of CERs from the future delivery contracts ended in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/emissions-trading-scheme/building/regulatory-updates/restricting-cers.html |title= Regulations restricting the use of HFC-23 and N2O CERs in the NZ ETS

==Reaction to the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Act 2009==

===Business and farming===
According to Brian Fallow, the [[New Zealand Herald]] Economics editor, business lobby groups such as [[Business New Zealand]] and the Greenhouse Policy Coalition (representing the energy intensive sector) welcomed the introduction of a temporary price cap and the principle of basing free allocations of units on the basis of intensity of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallow&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Fallow
|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/climate-change/news/article.cfm?c_id=26&amp;objectid=10597295&amp;pnum=0 |title=Business backs emissions plan changes |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kSTyYVYF |archivedate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2009, the Greenhouse Policy Coalition described the proposed changes to the NZ ETS as &quot;a welcome move in the right direction&quot;. The Coalition stated that it approved of the half-cost unit surrender obligation in the first commitment period, the $12.50 price cap on carbon, and the slower phase-out of assistance to industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenhousepolicy.org.nz/Site/News_Releases/ETS_Changes_.aspx |title=ETS Changes Welcome |publisher=Greenhouse Policy Coalition |author=Catherine Beard |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113022755/http://greenhousepolicy.org.nz/Site/News_Releases/ETS_Changes_.aspx |archivedate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Business New Zealand]] welcomed National's revisions to the NZ ETS of 14 September 2009 as better balancing environmental and economic needs, and stated that it was pleased that the Government had accepted the intensity basis for allocation of units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.businessnz.org.nz/doc/1742/RevisedETSmoremeasured |title= Revised ETS ‘more measured’ |publisher=Business NZ

The Business Council for Sustainable Development stated that New Zealand was risking &quot;being left behind&quot; in proposing an all-sectors, all-gases ETS that in 2015 would have almost no impact on heavy emitting industries facing international competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Neilson |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0909/S00792.htm |title=NZ needs to move to post-recession clean economy |publisher=Press Release: Business Council for Sustainable Development |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Federated Farmers]] commented that &quot;there is no place for agricultural emissions in the ETS&quot;, that &quot;the Government must seek to remove agriculture at Copenhagen in December&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.fedfarm.org.nz/n1683.html |title=ETS announcement a mixed bag for agriculture |publisher= [[Federated Farmers]] of New Zealand |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2009

===Editorial opinion===
''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' described the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Bill as &quot;backward legislation&quot; and a &quot;miserable offering to the international effort&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/carbon-trading/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501831&amp;objectid=10609679 |title=Editorial: Another sorry chapter in emissions farce |newspaper= New Zealand Herald |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2010 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5tgtkU5Yj  |archivedate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'' commented that the NZ ETS is a failure because &quot;those responsible for the emissions don't have to foot the bill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/opinion/editorials/2868063/Editorial-Lost-opportunity-on-emissions-deal |title=Editorial: Lost opportunity on emissions deal |newspaper= The Dominion Post |publisher=Fairfax Media Ltd |accessdate=3 February 2010 |date=16 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' stated: &quot;Our poorly thought-out emissions trading scheme does nothing to enhance our reputation&quot; and predicted that the lack of bi-partisan support for the NZ ETS would lead to further uncertainty in New Zealand's climate-change policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3629/columnists/14473/scheming_behaviour.html |title=Editorial: Scheming behaviour | journal =New Zealand Listener |accessdate=29 January 2010 |date=28 November 2009 | volume =221 | issue = 3629 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522204208/http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3629/columnists/14473/scheming_behaviour.html |archivedate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International media===
In November 2009, the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' reported that the revised NZETS had been “significantly watered down” and that it gave “big polluters a much easier ride”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/kiwis-beat-aussies-to-climate-scheme-20091125-jrp1.html |title= Kiwis beat Aussies to climate scheme |author=NZPA |date=25 November 2009 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/66fmmAB7W |archivedate= 5 April 2012 |accessdate= 5 April 2012 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reuters]] reported that the amended NZ ETS allowed unlimited imports of offsets and that business groups largely backed the changes, while environmental groups largely felt that the NZ ETS would not do enough to reduce emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/25/us-newzealand-carbon-idUSTRE5AO0JB20091125?sp=true |title=New Zealand passes revamped carbon law |first=Gyles |last=Beckford |publisher= Reuters |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zkh7UtOF |archivedate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, Reuters reported that the NZ ETS had &quot;no emissions cap nor any limit on the number of free carbon permits for energy-intensive companies that export their products&quot;. Reuters noted that the absence of a cap and the two-tonnes-for-one-unit surrender arrangement had led to &quot;accusations of some big polluters getting a free ride and that the scheme will fail to cut emissions of planet-warming gases&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62O1MK20100325 |title=Expanded New Zealand carbon scheme faces lean trading  |publisher=Reuters |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=26 August 2010 |first=Adrian |last=Bathgate |first2=Fogarty |last2=David |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5tguFnSZg  |archivedate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, ''[[The Economist]]'' commented on the delayed entry of agriculture into the scheme and noted the environmental concerns over the &quot;generous allocations of free carbon credits to business&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/research/articlesbysubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=7933604&amp;story_id=15763381 |author= Green.view |title= It’s not easy seeming green: A backlash to New Zealand’s vow of purity |newspaper=The Economist |date=23 March 2010|quote=The emissions-trading scheme excludes agricultural emissions until 2015, and its generous allocations of free carbon credits to business have been lambasted by environmentalists |accessdate=25 March 2010 |archiveurl= https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B8LhMBA3NXL4NmU5MjNkZTMtOWZiNi00NzhkLWI0NGYtYzE1ZDQyNjk4NDky&amp;hl=en_GB   |archivedate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Rod Oram]] commented in a ''Sunday Star Times'' column that the National Government's changes to the ETS were &quot;a giant step backwards&quot; which would &quot;drive up emissions, perpetuate old technology, necessitate ever-greater subsidies and reduce New Zealand's international competitiveness and reputation.&quot; Oram considered that the amendments to the NZ ETS destroyed its effectiveness. His examples were: removing limits on emissions by adopting intensity-based allocation of free carbon credits, slavishly following climate-laggard Australia, minimising the price incentive by extending the free allocation of credits for 75 years, muting the price signal with a $NZ25 per tonne of carbon cap, forcing forestry holders of credits to sell them overseas because of the $NZ25 per tonne cap, cancelling complementary measures such as fuel efficiency standards, giving in to special pleading via subsidies, and creating uncertainty for business.&lt;ref name=&quot;oram&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Rod |last= Oram |authorlink=Rod Oram |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/business/2880926/One-giant-step-backwards |title=One giant step backwards |newspaper= Sunday Star Times |publisher=  Stuff.co.nz/Fairfax |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kSQrZ5f9  |archivedate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin James (journalist)|Colin James]] described the National ETS as &quot;...the ETS you have when you are not having an ETS - no cap on emissions (so no &quot;cap&quot; in the &quot;cap-and- trade&quot;), a cap on price (so no &quot;trade&quot;, just tickle the taxpayer) and languorous phase-downs of gross emissions which push out hard decisions (if needed) into a misty future&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colin |last= James |authorlink=Colin James (journalist) |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5qJ7CkHZj |archivedate=7 June 2010 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/opinion/2908174/ETS-scheme-cries-out-for-consensus |title=ETS scheme cries out for consensus |newspaper= The Dominion Post |publisher=Fairfax Media Ltd |date=28 September 2009|accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New Zealand Herald''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s economics editor Brian Fallow said: &quot;Clearly emissions will peak higher and later than they would have done under the existing scheme. But the higher and later the peak in emissions, the steeper and more economically costly the subsequent decline will have to be&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Fallow | first= Brian | url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10611623&amp;pnum=0 | title= Down in the forest something stirs | newspaper= The New Zealand Herald | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5mmhRczjC | archivedate=14 January 2010 | date= 26 November 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parties===
The [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] noted that the allocation of credits to emitters on a 'intensity' basis, with no cap on emissions, meant that emitters would have an incentive to continue to emit greenhouse gases. Taxpayers would have to fund the long period of assistance by allocation of free units to industry at a cost of up to $NZ2 billion by 2030.&lt;ref name=&quot;lab&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0909/S00367.htm |title=Nats approach to ETS shambolic from start to end |date=25 September 2009 |publisher=New Zealand Labour Party |accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour Party climate change spokesman [[Charles Chauvel (politician)|Charles Chauvel]] said that the National NZ ETS &quot;is fundamentally flawed on multiple levels.

[[Jeanette Fitzsimons]] of the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] said: &quot;This is the sort of emissions trading scheme you have when you still think climate change is a hoax&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Govt-gets-its-ETS-bill-through-first-reading/tabid/419/articleID/122617/Default.aspx |title=Govt gets its ETS bill through first reading |author=NZPA |work= TV3 News |date= 24 September 2009 |quote=This is the sort of emissions trading scheme you have when you still think climate change is a hoax |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she commented that the NZ ETS would not reduce emissions and would be &quot;the biggest wealth transfer in New Zealand history from the taxpayer to the big polluters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.greens.org.nz/press-releases/government-wants-taxpayers-pay-twice-emissions |title=Government wants taxpayers to pay twice for emissions |date=31 August 2009 |publisher= Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Boscawen]] of the [[Act New Zealand|Act Party]] commented that the NZ ETS was a grand experiment, without precedent in any other nation in the world. Boscawen was critical of the effect that the ETS will have on households and farmers, stating that the average power bill will rise 10%, fuel bills will rise by 7 cents per litre and dairy farms will face an increase in costs before agriculture enters the scheme of NZ$7,500 per year as a result of associated increases in fuel, electricity and the cost of processing milk products. Boscawen called for the NZ ETS to be scrapped or delayed indefinitely.&lt;ref name=&quot;jbspeech&quot;&gt;{{cite speech| url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1003/S00415.htm | title =Speech:If the French Can Abandon Its Carbon Tax, Why Can't We? | first=John |last=Boscawen |date=24 March 2010|accessdate=5 April 2010|publisher=ACT Party |location=New Zealand Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental organisations===
[[Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand]] noted that the intensity-based allocation of NZ Units to industry and the slow phase-out of free units would allow emissions to grow and described the NZ ETS as &quot;pathetic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenpeace&quot;/&gt; Greenpeace's Simon Boxer described the NZETS to [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] as &quot;the worst emissions trading scheme in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name='worst'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Fonterra-vs-Greenpeace-The-debate-continues/tabid/572/articleID/130992/Default.aspx |title=Fonterra vs Greenpeace: The debate continues |quote=the worst emissions trading scheme in the world |work=(55 seconds); 3 News |author=Simon Boxer |publisher=TV3 |date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=8 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929004136/http://www.3news.co.nz/Fonterra-vs-Greenpeace-The-debate-continues/tabid/572/articleID/130992/Default.aspx |archivedate=29 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Taylor, of the [[Environmental Defence Society]], said that &quot;An emissions-trading scheme welcomed by polluters and coal producers is not going to work&quot; and &quot;New Zealand is now a climate change laggard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor |first=Gary Taylor |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&amp;objectid=10599933 |title=NZ is now climate change laggard |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ECO ([[Environment and Conservation Organisations of Aotearoa New Zealand]]) described the NZ ETS as a &quot;major disappointment&quot; and said that &quot;The changes allow 65 large companies long periods of subsidisation by taxpayers, particularly households, right out to 2050, with farmers and the fishing industry getting especially large subsidies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.eco.org.nz/news_item.asp?offset=10&amp;sID=178 |title=Emissions Trading System changes major reversal |publisher=Environment and Conservation Organisations of Aotearoa New Zealand |date=14 September 2009|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) New Zealand described the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme as &quot;a complete shambles&quot; because it sets no limit on total pollution, it allows emissions to grow and it transfers the cost of emissions from polluters to taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwf.org.nz/what_we_do/climate_change/climate_nz/emissions_trading_scheme/ |title= Emissions Trading Scheme |publisher=WWF New Zealand |accessdate=8 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603140125/http://www.wwf.org.nz/what_we_do/climate_change/climate_nz/emissions_trading_scheme/ |archivedate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon Trade Watch]] have described it &quot;as a taxpayer subsidy for plantations and energy companies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/articles/new-zealands-new-carbon-market-a-taxpayer-subsidy-for-plantations-and-energy-comp.html |title= New Zealand's new carbon market: a taxpayer subsidy for plantations and energy companies |first=Tamra |last=Gilbertson |first2=Oscar |last2=Reyes |date=20 July 2010  |publisher=Carbon Trade Watch |accessdate=12 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128194827/http://www.carbontradewatch.org/articles/new-zealands-new-carbon-market-a-taxpayer-subsidy-for-plantations-and-energy-comp.html |archivedate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment===
In October 2009, New Zealand's independent environmental watchdog, Jan Wright, the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment]], made a submission to the Select Committee considering National's amendments to the NZ ETS. The submission stated that the allocation of free units to industry was too generous and the length of the phase-out of free allocation was too slow. Without a carbon price signal to invest in low carbon technologies, emissions would continue to rise.&lt;ref name=&quot;pce1&quot;/&gt;

In November 2009, Wright was sufficiently concerned that the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment bill would result in increased emissions that she publicly urged politicians three times not to adopt the National Government's legislation. She opposed the removal of a firm cap on emissions, the reduction of price incentives to reduce emissions, and the heavy subsidies from taxpayers granted to emissions-intensive industry and agriculture by the intensity-based allocation of free units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New bill 'weakens ETS' says Environment Commissioner |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0910/S00231.htm |publisher=Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  |title= ETS amendments bill should not pass - Commissioner |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0911/S00146.htm |publisher=Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment |date=16 November 2009 |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  |title= ETS bill won't help environment - Commissioner |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0911/S00277.htm |publisher=Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Act was adopted, Wright said in a radio interview &quot;It's virtually certain our emissions will grow and the burden on the taxpayer will be uncurbed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tjvfduKe |archivedate=25 October 2010 |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5AO0JB20091125?sp=true |title=New Zealand passes revamped carbon law |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2010 |newspaper=Reuters |first=Gyles |last=Beckford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the energy and liquid fossil fuels were about to enter the NZ ETS in July 2010, Wright expressed her concern that although the NZ ETS was the right framework, the subsidies to big emitters would limit the incentives to reduce emissions and impose significant costs on the taxpayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author= Jan Wright |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1006/S00482.htm |title= ETS Good but Emitter Subsidies Bad |publisher=Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 review of the New Zealand ETS and amendments==
The [[Climate Change Response Act 2002]] requires a review of the NZ ETS by an independent review panel every five years, with the first review to be completed in 2011. An ''Issues Statement and Call for Written Submissions'' document was released in March 2011, and the final report was released in September 2011. The review focused on the high-level design of the NZ ETS, particularly in the context of international efforts to tackle climate change post-2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETSreview&quot;/&gt;

The report's major recommendations included: 
*phasing out the transitional two-for-one unit half-price surrender arrangement for a further three years to 2014, so that only from 2015 would emitters have to surrender one emissions unit for each tonne of emissions
*a $5 per year increase in the price cap from 2013 (instead of no price cap)
*that the agricultural sector should still enter in 2015, but should treated the same as other export industries 
*changes to the domestic ETS forestry accounting rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Doing New Zealand’s Fair Share. Emissions Trading Scheme Review 2011: Final Report |url=http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/emissions-trading-scheme/ets-review-2011/index.html |author=Emissions Trading Scheme Review Panel |year=2011 |publisher=Ministry for the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in the NZ Herald  said that there was no merit in the Government's view that lack of mitigation options meant that agriculture should be kept out of the NZ ETS. The editorial described this as 'extraordinary generosity' to the agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/carbon-trading/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501831&amp;objectid=10752920 |title= Editorial: Farmers must share burden on emissions |publisher=The Herald |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the Government released a consultation document in response to the review that stated that the Government intended to introduce amending legislation in July 2012, with the aim of passing it by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/consultation/ets/questions-answers.html#_Toc321912739 |title= Q7.

In November 2012, the Government passed the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012.&lt;ref name='groser12'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2012/0052/latest/DLM4676517.html |title=Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 |year = 2012 |publisher= NZ Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation extended the two-for-one unit surrender transitional measure indefinitely beyond 2012, indefinitely deferred the entry of agriculture, introduced an offsetting option for pre-1990 forests, created a statutory power to auction NZ units within an overall cap, and finally changed the treatment of the synthetic greenhouse gas sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012 amend info&quot;/&gt;
The Government stated that the amendments were necessary to:
*&quot;maintain the costs that the ETS places on the economy at current levels. This will ensure businesses and households do not face additional costs during the continued economic recovery; and that New Zealand continues to do its fair share on climate change.&quot;
*&quot;make a number of important changes designed to improve the operation of the ETS, providing more flexibility for forest landowners and ensuring the scheme is 'fit for purpose' after 2012.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2012 amend info&quot; /&gt;

==2015 review of the ETS==
In November 2015, the government started consultation on a review of the ETS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mfe.govt.nz/consultation/new-zealand-ets-review-201516-consultation | title=Consultation for the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme review 2015/16 | publisher=Ministry for the Environment | accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, the question of whether to include agriculture in the scheme is not being considered in the review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/290485/agriculture-left-out-of-emissions-review | title=Agriculture left out of emissions review | work=Radio New Zealand | date=25 November 2015 | accessdate=28 November 2015 | author=Bramwell, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market performance and trading==

===Unit register===
On 6 December 2007, the New Zealand Emission Unit Register (NZEUR) was established. The NZEUR has the role of issuing, holding, transferring and retiring emission units in terms of the Kyoto Protocol. The initial use of the NZEUR was to record Kyoto emission units allocated to firms enrolled in the [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Ministry for the Environment]]’s Projects to Reduce Emissions and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements programmes, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Permanent Forest Sink Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=  http://www.beehive.govt.nz/node/31569 |title= Launch of register for Kyoto units |publisher=New Zealand Government |date= 6 December 2007 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market size===
At 31 December 2008, the NZ Emissions Unit Register (NZEUR) had 128 official account holders. All were foresters except for four energy companies. 45 of the foresters reported removals (sequestration) of 692,583 tonnes of CO2-e and 692,583 NZUs were issued into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change Response Act 2002 Section 89: Chief Executive Reporting |url= https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8LhMBA3NXL4dHhCbEU3TkhaXzg

Foresters reported removals (sequestration) of 4,460,095 tonnes of CO2-e. Some foresters surrendered 4,526 NZUs for emissions from deforestation. 4,460,095 NZUs were issued into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change Response Act 2002 Section 89: Chief Executive Reporting

Foresters reported removals (sequestration) of 9,445,606 tonnes of CO2-e. The quantity of emissions reported was 33,410,389 tonnes of CO2-e for the 2010 calendar year and 16,286,618 tonnes of CO2-e were reported for the NZETS compliance period from 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2010. Due to the two tonnes for one NZU arrangement, emitters surrendered 8,303,660 NZUs for their emissions. 12,776,026 NZUs were issued by free allocation into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change Response Act 2002 Section 89: Chief Executive of Ministry of Economic Development Reporting |url= http://www.epa.govt.nz/Publications/Section_89_CE_Reporting_2010.pdf |format=PDF |publisher = Ministry of Economic Development |date= 24 June 2011 |accessdate =17 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Forestry removals (sequestration) in the 2011 calendar year were 13,820,979 tonnes of CO2-e and the quantity of emissions reported was 31,803,198 tonnes of CO2-e. 11,596,460 NZUs were issued by free allocation into the market.

===Export of units overseas===
In August 2009, forestry companies were selling units to NZ and international buyers. Forester Ernslaw One converted 520,000 NZ units into [[Assigned amount units]] and sold them to the Norwegian Government, in a landmark ground breaking deal brokered by leading New Zealand carbon broker, Carbon Market Solutions Ltd. At the time, it was the largest forestry carbon credit deal in the world. Industry sources estimated the prices were approximately $NZ21 to $NZ22 a tonne and that value of the trade would have been between $NZ10.9 million and $NZ11.4 million, depending on the exchange rate. Ernslaw One had also sold 50,000 units at $NZ20 (sales value about $NZ1 million worth) to a NZ buyer and then subsequently at the end of 2009 made a second 500,000 tonne trade with the Norwegian Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/73407/forests-carbon-credit-sale-world039s-biggest |title=Forests carbon credit sale world's biggest |first= Simon |last= Hartley |work= Otago Daily Times |date= 10 September 2009 |accessdate= 19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Import of international units===
As previously noted, the NZ ETS allows unlimited importing of international units which makes it a price-taker with only the international price as a constraint on emissions.&lt;ref name='Moyes'/&gt; In the first compliance period the six months to December 2010, less than 2 per cent of the surrendered units were imported from the international Kyoto markets (64 per cent had been bought from forest owners and 31 per cent had been allocated free to trade-exposed industrial emitters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10742385 |title=Govt sends ETS report back for updating |first=Brian |last=Fallow |work=The Herald |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 calendar year, NZ emitters made a large switch from domestic NZUs to cheaper international units.&lt;ref name='BD2012'/&gt; Of the 16.3 million units surrendered, 11.7 million units (or 72%) were imported international units (being 4.2 million CERs  4.3 million ERUs  and 3.2 million RMUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://climatechange.govt.nz/emissions-trading-scheme/building/reports/ets-report/ |title= NZ ETS 2011 Facts and figures |publisher = Ministry of Economic Development |date= August 2012 |accessdate= 13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, cheap international carbon credits made up 99.5 per cent of the units NZ emitters used to meet their obligations. Of these units, 91 percent were ERUs sourced from former Soviet Union countries that cannot be used in the European Union ETS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11303894 |title=Clock is ticking for cheap credits |first =Brian |last=Fallow |date=5 August 2014 |accessdate=7 March 2015 |work=The NZ Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Price movements===
[[File:Petrol-ets-2010-2015.svg|thumb|top|400px|New Zealand petrol prices and the NZETS component from 2010 to 2015]]
Up to January 2011, market prices for NZ Units were largely set by the international price for [[Certified Emission Reduction]] (CER) units. In March 2011, European concerns over the implications of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] for their nuclear reactors reduced atomic power generation and increased coal thermal generation. This caused extra demand for CERs in the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the effective price cap in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded at a record price of more than NZ$21 per tonne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL3E7EI06H20110318?sp=true |title=New Zealand carbon price touches all-time high  |author= Point Carbon/Reuters

NZU prices fell to $NZ16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1107/S00881/the-anatomy-of-the-cer-price-melt-down.htm |title= The Anatomy of the CER Price Melt Down |publisher= Environmental Intermediaries And Trading Group Ltd |date= 28 July 2011 |access-date= 17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 2012, the very low European carbon prices dragged the NZU price down to $NZ4.55 per tonne of carbon.&lt;ref name='BD2012'&gt;{{cite web  |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1208/S00158/big-emitters-chasing-cheap-foreign-carbon-units-mfe-data.htm

==Impacts on prices==

===Petrol===
In September 2007, the 2008 NZETS was expected to increase the GST-inclusive retail price of petrol by 3.7 cents a litre (2.5%) under a $15 carbon price scenario and 6.1 cents (4%) under a $25 scenario.&lt;ref name='FETS7'&gt;{{cite book |author= MfE |url= http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate-change/framework-new-zealand-emissions-trading-scheme/7-impacts-emissions |title=The Framework for a New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme - 7 The Impacts of the Emissions Trading Scheme |chapter= 7.2.1 Emissions from electricity |publisher=Ministry for the Environment |accessdate=18 March 2015 |date=September 2007 |series=Ref.

===Electricity===
In 2007, the 2008 NZETS was expected to increase the retail price of electricity by 1 cent/kwh (5%) under a $15 carbon price scenario and 2 cents/kwh (10%) under a $25 scenario.&lt;ref name='FETS7'/&gt; The official &quot;NZETS Question and Answers&quot; fact sheet of September 2007 noted that the NZETS may cause retail electricity bills to increase by 4 or 5%.&lt;ref name='QA'/&gt; In 2009 the 2009 NZETS was expected to increase electricity prices by 5% (1c/kWh) in comparison with an increase of by 10% (2c/kWh) under the 2008 NZETS.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;/&gt; In April 2011, a report prepared by consultants Covec for the Ministry for the Environment concluded that the NZETS had no discernible impact on either wholesale or retail electricity prices.&lt;ref name='Denne'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatechange.govt.nz/emissions-trading-scheme/ets-review-2011/supporting-info/impacts-of-actual-vs-expected-effects.pdf |title=Impacts of the NZETS: Actual vs Expected Effects |first= Tim |last= Denne |publisher=Covec Ltd |date=April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, the five major electricity generating companies were asked by officials about NZETS costs being passed through in electricity prices.
