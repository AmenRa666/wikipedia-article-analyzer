The '''Vikos–Aoös National Park''' ({{lang-el|Εθνικός Δρυμός Βίκου–Αώου}} ''Ethnikós Drymós Víkou–Aóou'') is a [[national park]] in the region of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] in northwestern [[Greece]]. The park, founded in 1973, is one of ten [[National parks of Greece|national parks]] in mainland Greece and is located {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} north of the city of [[Ioannina, Greece|Ioannina]] in the northern part of the [[Pindus]] mountain range. It is named after the two major gorges of the area and encompasses {{convert|12600|ha|acres|0}} of mountainous terrain, with numerous rivers, lakes, [[cave]]s, deep [[canyon]]s, dense [[coniferous]] and [[deciduous]] forest. The park is part of the [[Natura 2000]] ecological network and one of [[UNESCO]] [[Geopark]]s and spans an elevation range from {{convert|550|to|2497|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name= Trakolis3/&gt; Over 100,000 people visit the park each year and take part in activities including rafting, canoe-kayaking, hiking and mountain biking.&lt;ref name=prefectur20/&gt;

The core of the park, an area of {{convert|3400|ha|acres|0|sp=us}},&lt;ref name= Trakolis3/&gt; comprises the spectacular [[Vikos Gorge]], carved by the [[Voidomatis]] river. The gorge's main part is {{convert|12|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and attains a depth of {{convert|1000|m|ft|sp=us}}. The Aoös gorge, mount [[Tymfi]] ({{convert|2497|m|ft|sp=us}} at Gamila peak), and a number of traditionally preserved settlements form the park's peripheral zone. The park's remoteness and relatively small human population, combined with the great variation of [[biotope]]s and microclimatic conditions favors the existence of a rich variety of flora (1,800 species) in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Spanopoulou 2001, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=natura8&gt;Natura 2000, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Vikos–Aoös National Park supports a wide diversity of fauna,&lt;ref name=Amanatidou28&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; with a plethora of large mammals such as the [[brown bear]], for which the park is one of the last European strongholds, and a variety of natural habitats and ecosystems that rank it among the most valuable parks for nature conservation in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou 2001, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The first evidence of human presence in the area is dated between 17,000 and 10,000 years ago. The area of the park has been sparsely populated throughout historical times, however from the 17th to the 19th century the local communities of [[Zagori]] acquired an autonomous status, flourished economically due to increased trade, and became a major center of [[folk medicine]].&lt;ref name=Vokou1/&gt; In recent decades, [[ecotourism]] is seen as a remedy to the economic decline of heavily depopulated local settlements, while preserving the natural environment and local architecture.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou41/&gt;

==Geography and geology==

===Vikos Gorge===
{{Main|Vikos Gorge}}
[[File:Vikos-gorge.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Panoramic view of Vikos Gorge|alt=Panoramic view of a deep gorge with grey and white cliffs and a man standing on the foreground, bottom left.]]
Vikos Gorge is located on the southern slopes of mount Tymfi.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou21/&gt; Its main part is located between the villages of [[Vikos, Ioannina|Vikos]] and [[Monodendri, Ioannina|Monodendri]] and attains a depth of about {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Amanatidou 2005, p. 17&quot;&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; with a southeast-northwest direction.&lt;ref name=natura8/&gt;  The landscape of the {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long gorge, {{convert|12|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} which belongs to the park's core zone,&lt;ref name= Hanlidou2&gt;Hanlidou, Kokkini 1997, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; presents a diverse relief and is characterized by abrupt changes in altitude.  At one point the gorge measures {{convert|900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|1100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide from rim to rim, and as a result is listed by the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the deepest [[canyon]] in the world in proportion to its width,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Northern Greece: The Pindhos Mountains: A Greentours Natural History Holiday | format=PDF | url=http://www.greentours.co.uk/Images_holidays/trip_reportS/TripReportNorthernGreece2008edited.pdf | accessdate=2010-08-10 |work=greentours.co.uk |page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some gorge lobbyists contest that claim.&lt;ref name=Hellander&gt;{{cite book | author= Hellander Paul | title=Greece | publisher=Lonely Planet | year=2008 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=QwnPywIER0YC&amp;dq= | page = 335 | isbn=978-1-74104-656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steep slopes and precipitous rocky cliffs dominate in the middle and higher zones respectively. Numerous [[gully|gullies]] dissect both sides of the gorge and the weathering action of water down its walls creates extended [[scree]]s.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou21/&gt;

The Vikos Gorge has been carved over millions of years by the [[Voidomatis]] river, a tributary of the [[Aoos|Aoös]]. The Voidomatis is mostly seasonal, with year-round flow occurring only in the lower part of the gorge.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou21&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its nature, the area of the gorge is precipitous and impassable most of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Natura 2000, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Vikos Gorge is a deep cross section of the mountain, its slopes expose a series of rock formations of various ages. The upper layers, at a depth of 0–{{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}, consist of relatively young [[Eocene]] [[limestone]], at a depth of {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}&amp;ndash;{{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} they consist of a [[stratum]] from the [[Campanian]] era, while below {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} they consist of [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] limestone. In the deepest layers, grey Jurassic [[dolomite]] is dominant.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou21/&gt; Sedimentary and [[lithology|lithological]] investigation in the Voidomatis basin revealed that the innermost [[Alluvium|alluvial]] deposits consist of limestone-derived material, carried by the Voidomatis river from higher elevations by [[Glacial erosion#Ice|glacial action]] about 30,000 years ago. The subsequent (middle) deposits are the product of de-glaciation and the extended run-off from the uplands about 20,000 years ago, while the outer unit is attributed to human activities associated with [[pastoralism]], which caused extended deforestation and soil erosion.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou32&gt;Amanatidou p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Voidomatis basin contains evidence for three major phases of [[glaciation]], with the two largest and earliest taking place during the [[Middle Pleistocene]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Hamlin, Macklin, Hughes, Lewin 2008, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The final phase of glacial activity probably occurred during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], between 22,000 and 20,000 ago.&lt;ref name=Woodwar49/&gt;

A special feature of the limestone, resulting from its weathering by water, is its [[Karst topography|karstic]] nature.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou2122&gt;Amanatidou 2005, pp. 21&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt; During the large [[Middle Pleistocene]] glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network because much of the upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during [[interglacial]] and [[interstadial]] periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst drainage system.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Hamlin, Macklin, Hughes, Lewin 2008, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou2122/&gt;

[[File:D70-0142-aoos-gorge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Aoos Gorge, with Mount [[Tymfi]] in the background]]

===Aoös Gorge===
In the northern part of the Park, and very close to the town of [[Konitsa]],&lt;ref name=natura8/&gt; the [[Aoos|Aoös]] river passes through channels formed by the bulges of the nearby mountains of Trapezitsa {{convert|2022|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Tymfi and Raidovouni {{convert|1957|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, creating another gorge that is {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long. The canyon has an east-west direction and features numerous stone [[Arch bridge|single-arched bridges]] from the 17th to 19th centuries as well as [[monastery|monasteries]] built in the local architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;Papadopoulou 2008, p. 12, 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by the great number of secondary gullies and currents,&lt;ref name= Hanlidou2/&gt; while the southern part of the gorge is steeper than the northern part. Deep and steep ravines within the perpendicular walls bring down to the Aoös large quantities of limestone-weathering material.&lt;ref&gt;Paschos, Nikolaou, Papanikos 2004, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The compact [[Dolostone|dolomite rock]]s that lie on the bottom of the gorge date to the [[Early Jurassic]] period and are the oldest rock formations in the Park. Their age has been determined by means of sea [[fossil]]s found inside them.&lt;ref&gt;Paschos, Nikolaou, Papanikos 2004, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tymfi===
{{Main|Tymfi}}
[[File:Drakolimni Panorama 9s.jpg|thumb|300px|Drakolimni (Dragonlake), overlooked by Ploskos (center) and Astraka (right) peaks|alt=A small lake surrounded by alpine pasture with traces of snow and two mountain peaks in the background: center and right.]] 
Between the two gorges lies the Tymfi mountain range. Its highest peaks are Gamila {{convert|2497|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Astraka {{convert|2436|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Ploskos {{convert|2400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and Lapatos {{convert|2251|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name= Hanlidou2/&gt; A unique feature of this area are the natural pools formed by the erosion of local stream beds.&lt;ref name=Pashos15/&gt; In the high-altitude zone of Tymfi, a number of [[alpine lake]]s home to several rare amphibian species are found surrounded by alpine pasture. The biggest lake of the National Park, [[Drakolimni]] (&quot;Dragonlake&quot;), a formation that was created after the retreat of the [[glacier]]s,&lt;ref name=Pashos15&gt;Paschos, Nikolaou, Papanikos 2004, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; is located at a height of {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on mount Tymfi. Its maximum depth is {{convert|4.95|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, while its surface covers {{convert|1|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denoel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denoël |first1=Mathieu |last2=Schabetsberger |first2=Robert |title=Resource partitioning in two heterochronic populations of Greek Alpine newts, Triturus alpestris veluchiensis |format=PDF |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6VR3-487F13Y-3-F&amp;_cdi=6223&amp;_user=275166&amp;_orig=search&amp;_coverDate=04%2F01%2F2003&amp;_sk=999759998&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkWA&amp;md5=79ea7bb224074bcd86d52938b3afa888&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-11-02 |work=University of Liège, Belgium.

A number of [[vertical cave]]s and precipices are found in the area around the village of [[Papingo]], which lies near Gamila and Astraka peaks. Some of them bear names inspired from [[Greek Mythology|mythology]], such as the ''Hole of [[Odysseus]]'' and ''Chasm of [[Epic poetry|Epos]]''. These are being studied and explored by caving enthusiasts. The cave of &quot;Provatina&quot; (&quot;Ewe's Cave&quot;), with a depth of {{convert|408|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, one of the deepest worldwide, was first discovered in 1965 by British [[Speleology|speleologists]] of the [[Cambridge University Caving Club]], and has since then been surveyed by a large number of expeditions. The nearby ''Chasm of Epos'', with a depth of {{convert|451|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, drains the water coming from the surrounding plateaus.&lt;ref name=Paschos16&gt;Paschos, Nikolaou, Papanikos 2004, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Tymfi represents a series of uplifted fault blocks and faulted [[escarpment]]s and is largely composed of [[Palaeocene]]-[[Eocene]] limestone, with some exposures of [[Campanian]]-[[Jurassic]] dolomite and limestone on the northern scarp. The lower slopes are dominated by younger [[flysch]] rocks, which consist of thin beds of graded sandstones intercalated with softer, fissile [[siltstone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Gibbard, Woodward 2003, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Extended glacial conditions prevailed on the uplands of Mount Tymfi during the [[Late Quaternary]] period, ca. 28,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou32/&gt; The glacial landscape is well-developed, especially on the southern slopes of Mount Tymfi, across the Astraka-Gamila plateau, and in the upland terrain above the villages of [[Skamneli]] and [[Tsepelovo]], where lateral and terminal [[moraine]]s form major landscape features.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Hamlin, Macklin, Hughes, Lewin 2008, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Additional forms of glacial deposits, which extend down to {{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level,&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Gibbard, Woodward 2003, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; include [[rock glacier]]s and [[limestone pavement]]s.&lt;ref name=Woodwar49&gt;Woodward, Hamlin, Macklin, Hughes, Lewin 2008, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlements===
There are four villages inside the Vikos–Aoös National Park, and an additional nine near the borders of the peripheral zone. All of these settlements, in the western part of the [[Zagori]] region, are sparsely populated with a total population of 1,515 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trakolis 2-3&quot;/&gt; The villages have a nucleus-like form, with the houses situated around the central square and interconnected by rocky pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, all the villages of the Zagori region were connected by a system of paths or small roads and they functioned more like a single entity rather than as separate communities.&lt;ref&gt;Vokou, Katradia, Kokkini 1993, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic affluence of Zagori's past is still reflected in the architecture of the villages,&lt;ref name=Vokou1/&gt; while today the preservation of the local architectural legacy is enshrined in a law which dictates that all buildings in the area must be constructed with local traditional materials and in compliance with local architecture. One of the characteristic features of the National Park are its stone bridges, which were the only connection to the outside world until roads were built in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Drakopoulou 2004, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen of these stone bridges and seven churches in the region have been listed as protected historical monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Spanopoulou 2001, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The climate of the Vikos–Aoös National Park is [[Mediterranean]], transitioning to [[continental climate|continental]]. The Mediterranean character is characterized by the annual distribution of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], high in the winter months and experiencing a [[drought]] period of two to three months in summer. The continental climatic element is attributed to the high amplitude of annual temperature variation, to such a degree that the difference between mean maximum and mean minimum annual temperature, exceeds {{convert|40|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou2324/&gt; The climate of the area is quite unique due to the complex relief, variation in altitude, and the position of the area with regard to the [[Ionian Sea]] coastline.&lt;ref&gt;Paschos, Nikolaou, Papanikos 2004, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The mean annual temperature and annual precipitation are {{convert|11.9|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1,100.9|mm|inch|abbr=on}} respectively. Extremely low temperatures occur in the area during the winter months. Compared to Mediterranean bioclimatic divisions, the area belongs to the [[Humid subtropical climate|humid zone]] with cold winters.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou2324&gt;Amanatidou 2005, pp. 23&amp;ndash;24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Papingo meteorological station, 1971-1990 climatic data |year = | url= http://www.hnms.gr/hnms/greek/meteorology/meteorology_00_html | accessdate=2010-11-13 |work=Hellenic National Meteorological Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park's varied geology and topography have resulted in a unique variety of [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. There are three main [[habitat]] zones:&lt;ref&gt;Amanatidou 2005, pp. 29&amp;ndash;31&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-[[mediterranean]] woodland which mainly consists of deciduous broadleaf forests and woodlands and extends up to an elevation of about {{convert|1500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Combined areas of agricultural land with tree hedges and various [[woodlot]]s, in addition to semi-open [[shrubland]]s and rocky sites of the lower and middle slopes near human settlements. Uplands with [[subalpine]] [[grassland]]s and rocky cliffs. This habitat is found above {{convert|1500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} altitude and hosts important bird species such as the Mediterranean [[golden eagle]].

===Flora===
The forests are composed of diverse species of [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] trees and a great variety of [[wildflower]]s. An important element of the region's flora, apart from the rich variety of plant species, is the high degree of [[endemism]] in Balkan (23%) and Greek species (5.8%).&lt;ref&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies on the flora of the National Park counted 873 [[vascular plant]]s, including more than 250 medicinal, aromatic, and poisonous [[taxa]]. The park's forests are abundant in species associated with the cool local climate, such as [[Ulmus glabra|Wych Elm]], [[Campanula trachelium|Nettle-leaved Bellflower]], [[Aesculus hippocastanum|Horse-chestnut]] and [[Tilia platyphyllos|Large-leaved Linden]].&lt;ref&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In the valley of the Vikos Gorge, ''[[Platanus orientalis]]'' form an azonal gallery forest along the banks of the Voidomatis.&lt;ref&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The woodland in the mountain area around the village of Papingo is characterized by the predominance of different [[juniper species]], such as ''[[Juniperus communis]]'', ''[[Juniperus foetidissima|foetidissima]]'', ''[[Juniperus oxycedrus|oxycedrus]]'' and ''[[Juniperus excelsa|excelsa]]''. In the upper hills ''[[Juniperus foetidissima]]'' dominates, with exceptionally high (more than {{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) trees. At higher altitudes, pure conifer forests of either [[pine]] or [[fir]] are found.&lt;ref&gt;Vokou, Katradia, Kokkini 1993, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on the non-vascular flora recorded the presence of about 150 [[moss]] species in the area of the national park, including one newly described [[taxon]].&lt;ref name=Amanatidou28/&gt; Many herbs of the Vikos Gorge and other areas within the park were regarded to have medicinal properties and were once harvested by local healers, colloquially referred to as &quot;[[Vikos doctors]]&quot; ({{lang-el|Βικογιατροί}}, &quot;''Vikoiatri''&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanlidou&quot;&gt;Hanlidou, Kokkini 1997, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; These herbal healers used special recipes that were often copies of ancient Greek recipes of [[Hippocrates]] or [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]] and became famous beyond the borders of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Vokou, Katradia, Kokkini 1993, p. 1,8&lt;/ref&gt; The plants used in these recipes include the lemon balm ''[[Melissa officinalis]]'', ''[[Tilia tomentosa]]'', the spearmint ''[[Mentha spicata]]'', the gas-plant ''[[Dictamnus|Dictamnus albus]], ''St John’s Wort ''[[Hypericum perforatum]]'',  absinth ''[[Artemisia absinthium]]'', the very popular ''[[Sideritis|Sideritis raeseri]]'', known colloquially in Greece as “mountain tea”, and the elder bush ''[[Sambucus nigra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Vokou, Katradia, Kokkini 1993, pp. 3&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt; A chemical screening of these native plant species has shown that a high number of them are characterized by [[biological activity|biologically active]] ingredients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanlidou&quot;/&gt; A collection of 2,500 dried species of local plants and herbs is exhibited in the local natural history museum in the village of [[Koukouli, Ioannina|Koukouli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Facaros Dana |author2=Theodorou Linda | title=Greece | publisher=New Holland Publishers| year=2003 |location= | page = 434 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=UlBjpoeo9-gC&amp;pg=PA432&amp;dq=Vikos-Aoos+National+Park| isbn=978-1-86011-898-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
[[File:Alpenmolch Alpine Newt Triturus alpestris.jpg|thumb|left|Triturus Alpestris. Its presence is associated with local folktales about dragons.|alt=The Alpine newt stands on a rocky surface.]]
Vikos–Aoös National Park preserves one of the richest mountain and forest ecosystems in terms of wildlife diversity in Greece.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou28/&gt; Numerous species of large [[mammal]]s such as [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, wild horses, and [[roe deer]] are found in the area year-round. [[Otter]]s and [[wild cat]]s live around the area of [[Tymfi]], with the latter being quite rare.&lt;ref name= Trakolis3/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amanatidou29&quot;/&gt; The [[Pindus]] range, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, is home to the endangered [[brown bear]] and [[lynx]], and is also the southernmost point of their European habitat.&lt;ref name=Natura9&gt;Natura 2000: p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; One of the park's special attractions is the existence of the [[chamois]] (''Rupicapra rupicapra''), a rare species that lives at higher altitudes far from human activity, especially at the rocky cliffs of the gorges,&lt;ref name=Natura9/&gt; for example in ''Megas Lakos'', a secondary ravine of the Vikos Gorge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amanatidou29&quot;&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drakopoulou 2004, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 121 bird species have been observed in the park, with twenty-six of them being considered of conservation priority. The area hosts fifteen [[Bird of prey|raptor]] species and populations of bird species with limited distribution in Greece, such as the [[hazel grouse]], [[Tengmalm's owl]], [[wallcreeper]] and [[willow tit]]. The two bird communities that inhabit the subalpine and forest ecosystems are considered among the most complete in Greece:&lt;ref name=&quot;Amanatidou28&quot;/&gt; The first community includes species that nest and feed in the subalpine area, like the [[alpine chough]], [[shore lark]], [[western rock nuthatch]] and [[alpine swift]], while the second comprises birds of prey like the [[griffon vulture]], [[Egyptian vulture]], [[peregrine falcon]] and [[common kestrel]], that search for food in a wider zone.&lt;ref&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:IMG 2284-frog-in-aoos-river.jpg|thumb|A tiny frog in the river Aoos|alt=A small frog on the side of a river sitting on brown sand.]]

Vikos-Aoös also contains a variety of suitable habitats that support dense populations of amphibians and reptiles. ''[[Vipera ursinii]]'' lives in the subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon.&lt;ref name=Natura9/&gt; The amphibian [[alpine newt]]s (''Triturus alpestris''), living in the alpine lakes of the [[Tymfi]] region, mostly in Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jackson Jack | title=The world's great adventure treks | publisher=New Holland Publishers | year=2003 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=yG5BtE7Hx9kC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Vikos-Aoos+National+Park | page = 114 | isbn=978-1-84330-261-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellow-bellied toad]]s (''Bombina variegata'') are also common in that same area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denoel&quot;/&gt; Numerous fish, such as [[brown trout]], [[Common roach|roach]], and [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]] are to be found in the park's rivers.&lt;ref name= Trakolis3/&gt; Regarding [[invertebrates|invertebrate]] species, due to the structural complexity of the forests and the co-existence of various small biotopes, i.e. streams, ponds, forest openings, rocky sites, dead trees, old pollards, and [[coppice]]s, a very diverse fauna exists. This occurs especially at the various [[ecotones]], including often very specialized species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amanatidou29&quot;/&gt;

==Human history==
[[File:Zagori - Kipi bridge.JPG|thumb|left|Plakidas bridge, a three arched stone bridge near the village of [[Kipoi, Ioannina|Kipoi]]&lt;ref&gt;Papadopoulou 2008, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=A three arched stone bridge stands over a small torrent.]]
The first evidence of human presence in the area is dated to between 17,000 and 10,000 years ago. During this period, favorable
climatic conditions prevailed that permitted the hunting of the [[Capra (genus)|ibex]] and the chamois on a seasonal basis.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou32/&gt; Important [[epipaleolithic]] artifacts have been unearthed from a [[rock shelter]] on the banks of the Voidomatis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25800523?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102785184593 | last = Gowlett| first = J.

The land was mainly used for pastoralism and supplying firewood.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou34&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the era of Ottoman rule, and especially from the 17th to the 19th century, the local [[Greek Orthodox church|Greek Orthodox]] communities were granted special privileges by the Ottoman authorities. At that time the area of [[Zagori]] acquired an [[Koinon of the Zagorisians|autonomous status]] inside the [[Ottoman Empire]], whereby the locals were exempt from the fiscal extortion that crippled the more prosperous lowland communities.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=M. V. Sakelarriou | title=Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization | publisher=Ekdotikē Athēnōn | year=1997 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=UV1oAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=zagori%2Bautonomy&amp;dq=zagori%2Bautonomy| isbn=978-960-213-371-2 | page = 342}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period large groups of villagers emigrated to metropolitan centers. Many among them became members of successful professional classes before finally returning to their home villages, endowing the region with wealth and building luxurious mansions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=De Jongh Brian |author2=Gandon John |author3=Graham-Bell Geoffrey | title=Companion guide to Greece  | publisher=Companion Guides| year=2000 | page = 482 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bko8u2MQA5oC&amp;dq=| isbn=978-1-900639-35-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such an environment, the art of [[herbal healing]] by the so-called Vikos doctors developed and flourished. This was accompanied by an impressive cultural and intellectual life that produced many renowned scholars and benefactors of Greece.&lt;ref name=Vokou1&gt;Vokou, Katradia, Kokkini 1993, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is nowadays sparsely populated as the result of [[urbanization]] after [[World War II]]. Many of the dwellings now remain shut, while abandonment of the traditional rural economy has affected the cultural landscape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amanatidou 2005, p. 17&quot;/&gt; [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], of which Vikos–Aoös is part, is considered one of the most underdeveloped regions in Greece. Tourism constitutes the principal source of revenue for the local economy, although it has a highly seasonal character. Intense development in terms of accommodation and tourism infrastructure occurred in the 1980s, mainly through state initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drakopoulou: p. 28&quot;/&gt;

==Park management==
[[File:D70-0661-natural-pools-of-Papingo.JPG|thumb|Natural pools near [[Papingo]]|alt=A small pool on a rocky surface.]]
Vikos–Aoös was designated as a [[National parks of Greece|National Park]] in 1973, in an effort by the [[Greek Government]] to conserve the richness of the local fauna and flora and the geological formations of the area.&lt;ref name= Trakolis3&gt;Trakolis 2001, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration and management of the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)]] in the village of [[Papingo]] plays an essential role in management issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drakopoulou: p. 28&quot;&gt;Drakopoulou 2004, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trakolis 2-3&quot;&gt;Trakolis 2001, pp. 2&amp;ndash;3&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land [[erosion]], [[landslides]], and [[wildfires]] which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another issue is the impact of tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure network, mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.&lt;ref name=petrakis/&gt;

[[File:D70-1532-voidhomatis-path.jpg|thumb|left|Hikers walking along the Voidomatis river|alt=A group of hikers walking along a river among Platanus orientalis trees]]
The vast area of the National Park and the present lack of road infrastructure make [[remote sensing]] the only means for monitoring the human activities in the area and their impact on the [[ecosystem]]. An analysis has begun by taking a detailed picture of the territory covering at least the following items: [[orography]] and slopes, road networks, land cover and use, human settlements, and tourist sites. The use of [[remote sensing]] and [[geographic information system]] techniques is of essential value for the park's management and constitutes the basis for further evaluations and impact analysis.&lt;ref name=petrakis&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Petrakis |first1= M. | last2= Psiloglou |first2=B. | last3= Lianou |first3=M. | last4= Keramitsoglou, |first4=I.  | last5= Cartalis |first5=C.|title= Evaluation of forest fire risk and fire extinction difficulty at the mountainous park of Vikos-Aoos, Northern Greece: use of remote sensing and GIS techniques | journal= International Journal of Risk Assessment and Management |volume= 5 |issue= 1| year=2005 | editor= | pages = 50&amp;ndash;65 |url= http://inderscience.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,4,7;journal,31,39;linkingpublicationresults,1:110887,1 |doi=10.1504/IJRAM.2005.006612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the present state and regional policy is to carefully combine tourism development in the area with the preservation of its natural and cultural heritage. [[Ecotourism]] poses an ideal solution, since it has the potential of bringing about the desired balance between socio-economic development and environmental protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drakopoulou: p. 28&quot;/&gt; Specific objectives of ecotourism development include reviving traditional activities such as small-scale farming and stock-raising,&lt;ref&gt;Drakopoulou 2004, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; as well as establishing a network of communities of chamois biotopes.&lt;ref&gt;Drakopoulou 2004, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreation==
[[File:D70-0584-pan-voidomatis-rafting.jpg|thumb|300px|Rafters on the bank of the Voidomatis|alt=A team of rafters is standing on the bank of a river.]]
Vikos–Aoös National Park is a natural tourist attraction, with high ecotourism and [[agrotourism]] potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trakolis11&quot;&gt;Trakolis 2001, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The local tourism industry has been favored by national and European funds and provides modest accommodation and tourism services, with respect to the local tradition and culture.&lt;ref name=Amanatidou41&gt;Amanatidou 2005, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, the ''Federation of Nature and National Parks of Europe'' (FNNPE) stated that &quot;the need for a sustainable form of tourism has never been greater in the area&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trakolis11&quot;/&gt;

The rivers in the Vikos–Aoös area are a destination for [[rafting]] and [[canoeing|canoe]]-[[kayaking]]. Additional forms of adventure sports include [[climbing]], [[hiking]] and [[mountain biking]] along local paths in order to observe the area's natural features and architecture.&lt;ref name=prefectur20&gt;Papadopoulou 2008, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drakopoulou: p. 28&quot;/&gt; Popular trails in the region include the crossing of the Vikos Gorge, which lasts approximately six to seven hours and is considered of medium difficulty, as well as hiking around the peaks of Tymfi.&lt;ref&gt;Paschos, Nikolaou, Papanikos 2004, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Several viewpoint are accessible only on foot, such as the Oxya and Beloe outlooks, and the 15th century [[Monastery of Saint Paraskevi (Vikos)|Monastery of Saint Paraskevi]] that offer panoramic views to the Vikos Gorge.&lt;ref name=Hellander/&gt;
