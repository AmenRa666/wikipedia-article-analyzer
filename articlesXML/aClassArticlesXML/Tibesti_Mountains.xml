:''For the current region of Chad, see [[Tibesti Region]].''

The '''Tibesti Mountains''' are a [[mountain range]] in the central [[Sahara]], primarily located in the extreme north of [[Chad]], with a small extension into southern [[Libya]]. The highest peak in the range, [[Emi Koussi]], lies to the south at a height of {{convert|3445|m|0}} and is the highest point in both Chad and the Sahara. [[Bikku Bitti]], the highest peak in Libya, is located in the north of the range. The central third of the Tibesti is of volcanic origin and consists of five [[shield volcano]]es topped by large [[volcanic crater|crater]]s: Emi Koussi, Tarso Toon, [[Tarso Voon]], Tarso Yega, and [[Toussidé]]. Major [[lava flow]]s have formed vast plateaus that overlie [[Paleozoic]] sandstone. The volcanic activity was the result of a continental [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] that arose during the [[Oligocene]] and continued in some places until the [[Holocene]], creating [[fumaroles]], [[hot spring]]s, [[mud pool]]s, and deposits of [[natron]] and [[sulfur]]. [[Erosion]] has shaped volcanic spires and carved an extensive network of canyons through which run rivers subject to highly irregular flows that are rapidly lost to the desert sands.

Tibesti, which means &quot;place where the mountain people live,&quot; is the domain of the [[Toubou people]]. The Toubou live mainly along the [[wadi]]s, on rare [[oasis|oases]] where [[palm tree]]s and limited [[grain]]s grow. They harness the water that collects in [[guelta]]s, the supply of which is highly variable from year-to-year and decade-to-decade. The plateaus are used to graze livestock in the winter and harvest grain in the summer. Temperatures are high, although the altitude ensures that the range is cooler than the surrounding desert. The Toubou, who first appeared in the range in the 5th century BC, adapted to these conditions and turned the range into a large natural fortress. They arrived in several waves, taking refuge in times of conflict and dispersing in times of prosperity, although not without intense internal hostility at times.

The Toubou came into contact with the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], [[Berbers]], [[Tuaregs]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and the [[Arabs]], as well as the [[France|French]] colonists who first entered the range in 1914 and took control of the area in 1929. The independent spirit of the Toubou and the geopolitical situation in the region has complicated the exploration of the range as well as the ascent of its peaks. Tensions continued after Chad and Libya gained independence in the mid-20th century, with hostage-taking and armed struggles occurring amid border disputes over the allocation of natural resources. The geopolitical situation and the lack of infrastructure has hampered the development of tourism.

The Saharomontane [[flora]] and [[fauna]], which include the [[rhim gazelle]] and [[Barbary sheep]], have adapted to the mountains, yet the climate has not always been as harsh. Greater [[biodiversity]] existed in the past, as evidenced by scenes portrayed in [[rock art|rock]] and [[parietal art]] found throughout the range, which date back several millennia, even before the arrival of Toubou. The isolation of the Tibesti has sparked the cultural imagination in both art and literature.

==Toponymy==
The Tibesti Mountains are named for the [[Toubou people]], also written ''Tibu'' or ''Tubu'', that inhabit the area. In the [[Kanuri language]], ''tu'' means &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;mountain&quot; and ''bu'' means &quot;a person&quot; or &quot;dweller,&quot; and thus ''Toubou'' roughly translates to &quot;people of the mountains&quot;{{efn|An alternative theory holds that the name ''Toubou'' means &quot;bird,&quot; because members of the Toubou communicate by whistling or because they run fast; however, it is unlikely that this theory is valid.&lt;ref name=room06 /&gt;}} and ''Tibesti'' to &quot;place where the mountain people live.&quot;&lt;ref name=room06&gt;{{cite book |last=Room |first=Adrian |title=Placenames of the World |edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=McFarland |page=375 |isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shoup11&gt;{{cite book |last=Shoup |first=John A. |title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2011 |page=284 |isbn=978-1-59884-362-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the mountain names are derived from [[Arabic]] as well as the [[Tedaga language|Tedaga]] and [[Dazaga language|Dazaga]] languages. The term ''ehi'' refers to peaks and rocky hills, ''emi'' to larger mountains, ''era'' to craters, and ''tarso'' to high plateaus or gently sloping mountains. For example, the Ehi Mousgou is a  {{convert|2849|m|adj=on}} stratovolcano near [[Tarso Voon]]; likewise, Era Kohor is a crater on top of Emi Koussi.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=611}}&lt;ref name=salam91&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salam |first1=M.

==Geography==

===Location===
[[File:Tibesti Worldwind.jpg|thumb|The Tibesti Mountains viewed from the south with the [[Emi Koussi]] in the lower right corner]]
The mountains lie on the border between [[Chad]] and [[Libya]], straddling the Chadian regions of [[Borkou Region|Borkou]] and [[Tibesti Region|Tibesti]] and the Libyan districts of [[Murzuq District|Murzuq]] and [[Kufra District|Kufra]], around {{convert|1000|km}} north of [[N'djamena]] and {{convert|1500|km}} south-southeast of [[Tripoli]]. The range is adjacent to [[Niger]] and located approximately halfway between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Lake Chad]], just south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]].{{sfn|Roure|1939}} The [[East African Rift]] is {{convert|1900|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east and the [[Cameroon line]] lies {{convert|1800|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southwest.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=611}}

The {{convert|2267|m|adj=on}} [[Bikku Bitti]], the highest point in Libya, is nearby, on the other side of the border. The average elevation of the Tibesti Mountains is about {{convert|2000|m}}; sixty percent of its area exceeds {{convert|1500|m|abbr=on}} in elevation.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}}

[[File:Emi Koussi Worldwind 3D.jpg|thumb|Computer-generated image of [[Emi Koussi]] from south, highlighting its form of [[shield volcano]] topped by a large [[volcanic crater|crater]] and extended to the north by Tarso Ahon]]

The range includes five [[shield volcano]]es whose diameter can reach {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}, with broad bases and the steepest peaks topped with large craters: Emi Koussi; Tarso Toon, which rises {{convert|2575|m|abbr=on}} above sea level; Tarso Voon; Tarso Yega; and Tarso Toussidé, which culminates in the peak of the same name.{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=15–20}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=609}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=615–616}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=620–621}} Tarso Yega has the largest crater, with a diameter of  {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} and a depth of approximately {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}}, while Tarso Voon has the deepest crater, with a depth of approximately {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} and a diameter of {{convert|12|to|13|km|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=615–616}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=622}} They are complemented by four large [[lava dome]] complexes, {{convert|1300|to|2000|m|abbr=on}} high and several km wide, all located in the central part of the mountain range: Tarso Tieroko; Ehi Yéy; Ehi Mousgou; and Tarso Abeki, which rises to {{convert|2691|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=615–616}} These volcanic complexes are now considered inactive, but according to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] were active during the [[Holocene]].{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=619}} Tarso Toussidé is an active volcano that has spewed lava over the past two millennia. Gases escaping from [[fumarole]]s on Toussidé are visible when evaporation is low.

The rest of the Tibesti Mountains consists of [[volcanic plateau]]s (''tarsos'' in the Tedaga language), located between {{convert|1200|and|2800|m|abbr=on}} elevation, as well as [[lava field]]s and [[ejecta]] deposits.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=609}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=615–616}} The plateaus are larger and more numerous in the east: the {{convert|7700|km2|adj=on|abbr=on}} Tarso Emi Chi, the {{convert|6500|km2|adj=on|abbr=on}} Tarso Aozi, the {{convert|3000|km2|adj=on|abbr=on}} Tarso Ahon to the north of Emi Koussi, and the {{convert|1200|km2|adj=on|abbr=on}} Tarso Mohi. In the center is Tarso Ourari at about {{convert|700|km2|abbr=on}}. To the west, in the vicinity of Tarso Toussidé, are the small plateaus of Tarso Tôh and Tarso Tamertiou, at {{convert|490|km2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|98|km2|abbr=on}}, respectively. The plateaus are strewn with [[lava spine|volcanic spires]] and are separated by canyons that have been formed by the irregular flow of [[wadi]]s.{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=15–20}}{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}}{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2262}} The central part of the range is striated by a network of [[dry valley]]s with the north- and east- facing slopes silted by the prevailing winds. After the typically violent rains, these slopes form ephemeral streams and flora. The southwest slopes in the south and west of the mountain range have a gentle rise, while the northern slope of the range is a cliff overlooking the vast Libyan [[desert pavement]] known as the Sarir Tibesti.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=67}}

===Hydrology===
Five rivers in the northern half of the Tibesti Mountains flow to Libya and are part of the [[Mediterranean Basin]], while the southern half belongs to the [[endorheic basin]] of [[Lake Chad]].{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}} However, none of the rivers travel long distances, as the water evaporates in the desert heat or seeps into the ground, although the latter may be carried great distances by subterranean [[aquifer]]s.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}}

[[File:Tibesti tributaries.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Tibesti ''enneris'']]

The wadis in the Tibesti are called ''enneris''. The water originates from the storms that periodically rage over the mountains. Their flow is highly variable.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}} For example, the largest wadi, named Bardagué (or Enneri Zoumeri on its upstream portion) and located in the northern part of the range, recorded a flow of {{convert|425|m3/s|abbr=on}} in 1954, yet over the next nine years it experienced four years of total drought, four years of flow less than {{convert|5|m3/s|abbr=on}} and one year where three different flow rates were measured: {{convert |4|,|9|and|32|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}} This variability is partly due to the irregularity of the monsoon that can bring rainfall from the southwest up to 20 degrees north latitude, but in some years may retreat before it reaches this latitude.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}}{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2263}} Two other significant rivers cut into the mountains: the Enneri Yebige flows northward until its riverbed disappears on the Sarir Tibesti plateau, while Enneri Touaoul joins the south-flowing Enneri Ke to form Enneri Miski, which then disappears in the plains of [[Borkou]]. Their basins are separated by an {{convert|1800|m|adj=on}} high [[Drainage divide|watershed]] that runs from Tarso Tieroko in the west to Tarso Mohi in the east.{{sfn|Roure|1939}}{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}} The Enneri Tijitinga is the longest wadi in the range, flowing some {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} southward. It forms in the west of the range and peters out in the [[Bodélé Depression]], as does Enneri Miski a little further to the east, along with other wadis such as the Enneri Korom and Enneri Aouei.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}} The Enneri Douanré also flows southward. The Enneri Torku and Enneri Ofoundoui lie to the north; the Enneri Uri, Enneri Binem and Enneri Modiounga are in the east; the Enneri Yeo, Enneri Mamar, Enneri Tao, Enneri Woudoui and Enneri Dooze are to the west.{{sfn|Getty Doby|2007|p=8}} Several rivers flow radially on the southern slopes of the Emi Koussi before seeping into the sands of Borkou and then reemerging at [[escarpment]]s up to {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} south of the summit, near the [[Ennedi Plateau]].{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}}

[[File:GueltaCamels.jpg|thumb|A view of the [[Guelta d'Archei]] in the [[Ennedi Plateau]], which is similar to the [[guelta]]s of the Tibesti Mountains]]

The Tibesti Mountains are a large area of [[tectonic uplift]] that, according to contemporary theory, resulted from a [[mantle plume]]{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=611}}{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}}&lt;ref name=pegram76&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pegram |first1=W.J. |last2=Register |first2=J.K., Jr. |last3=Fullagar |first3=P.D. |last4=Ghuma |first4=M.A. |last5=Rogers |first5=J.J.W. |title=Pan-African ages from a Tibesti Massif batholith, southern Libya |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=30 |issue=1 |year=1976 |pages=123–128 |doi=10.1016/0012-821X(76)90014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[craton]] of the [[African plate|African]] [[lithosphere]], which is about {{convert|130|to|140|km|abbr=on}} thick.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=619}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=616}} This tectonic uplift may have been accompanied by the opening, and subsequent closure via [[subduction]], of a [[rift zone]].&lt;ref name=makkrouf88&gt;{{cite journal |last=El Makkrouf |first=Ali Ahmed |title=Tectonic interpretation of Jabal Eghei area and its regional application to Tibesti orogenic belt, south central Libya (S.P.L.A.J.) |journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences (and the Middle East) |volume=7 |issue=7–8 |year=1988 |pages=945–967 |doi=10.1016/0899-5362(88)90009-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suayah06&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suayah |first1=Ismail B. |last2=Miller |first2=Jonathan S. |last3=Miller |first3=Brent V. |last4=Bayer |first4=Tovah M. |last5=Rogers |first5=John J.W. |title=Tectonic significance of Late Neoproterozoic granites from the Tibesti massif in southern Libya inferred from Sr and Nd isotopes and U–Pb zircon data |journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences |volume=44 |issue=4–5 |year=2006 |pages=561–570 |doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2005.11.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heart of the Tibesti is composed of [[schist]], [[basalt]] and [[diorite]] of the [[Ediacaran]] period, one of six exposures of [[Precambrian]] crystalline rock in [[North Africa]].

[[File:Pic Toussidé ASTER.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the more recent lava rock, in black, with Toussidé volcano (center) and the [[Trou au Natron]] crater (bottom right)]]

The volcanic activity took place in several phases.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=617–619}} In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian [[Basement (geology)|basement]] occurred in the central area. The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, and Ehi Yéy. The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=617–619}} In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast ''tarsos'', as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=617–619}} Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas. This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï [[lava dome]] and Tarson Voon. To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Toon. Emi Koussi increased in height.{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=15–20}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=617–619}} The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise. The end of this phase coincided with the beginning of the Holocene.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=617–619}} The Yirrigué volcano emitted [[pyroclastic]] ignimbrite up to {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} in all directions, filling in valleys.{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=15–20}} In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane. Calderas form on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=617–619}} Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé. With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance. The Trou au Natron and Doon Kidimi craters have formed even more recently, with the former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas. Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small [[cinder cone]]s, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi.{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=15–20}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=617–619}} Presently, there are reports of volcanic activity in various parts of the massif, including hot springs at the Soborom geothermal field and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=619}} Deposits of [[sodium carbonate]] in the Trou au Natron and Era Kohor craters reflect recent events, as does the formation of volcanic centers on the floor of Trou au Natron.{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=15–20}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=619}}

The study of [[fluvial terrace]]s has revealed coarse [[sand]] and [[gravel]] alternating with terraces of [[silt]], [[clay]] and fine sand. This alternation highlights repeated changes in the dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the [[Quaternary Period]]. The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered dense vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely far more diverse than that which exists today (with the exception of grasses).&lt;ref name=hagedorn97&gt;{{cite book |last=Hagedorn |first=H. |chapter=Tibesti |title=Sahara : paléomilieux et peuplement préhistorique au Pléistocène supérieur |editor-last=Tillet |editor-first=Thierry |publisher=L'Harmattan |year=1997 |language=French |trans_title=Sahara: paleoenvironments and prehistoric populations in the Upper Pleistocene |pages=267–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the discovery of calcified [[charophyta]] (particularly of the family [[Characeae]]) and [[gastropod]] fossils in Trou au Natron indicates the presence of a lake at least {{convert|300|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} deep during the [[Late Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=soulie10&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soulié-Märsche |first1=I. |last2=Bieda |first2=S. |last3=Lafond |first3=R. |last4=Maley |first4=J. |last5=M'Baitoudji |first5=M. |last6=Vincent |first6=P.M. |last7=Faure |first7=Hugues |title=Charophytes as bio-indicators for lake level high stand at &quot;Trou au Natron&quot;, Tibesti, Chad, during the Late Pleistocene |journal=Global and Planetary Change |volume=72 |issue=4 |year=2010 |pages=334–340 |doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last [[glacial maximum]], which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures.&lt;ref name=maley00&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maley |first=Jean |title=Last Glacial Maximum lacustrine and fluviatile Formations in the Tibesti and other Saharan mountains, and large-scale climatic teleconnections linked to the activity of the Subtropical Jet Stream |journal=Global and Planetary Change |volume=26 |issue=1–3 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8181(00)00039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the [[Lake Chad#History|Paleolake Chad]] until the [[5th millennium BC]].&lt;ref name=tourte05&gt;{{cite book |last=Tourte |first=René |title=Histoire de la recherche agricole en Afrique tropicale francophone |volume=Volume I: Aux sources de l'agriculture africaine: de la Préhistoire au Moyen Âge |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=2005 |page=11 |language=French |trans_title=History of agricultural research in French tropical Africa |isbn=978-92-5-205407-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
&lt;!--[[File:Chad sat.jpg|thumb|upright|Satellite image of Chad with the brown-colored Tibesti Mountains to the north]]--&gt;

The Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding [[Sahara Desert]]. Rainfall events are more intense and more frequent, but they are also highly variable from year to year.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}} Indeed, the Tibesti can see seven to eight years pass between storms. In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward Northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by the humid [[monsoon]]al air. Normally, the ITCZ repels the [[Harmattan]], a dry trade wind that blows south-west from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti.{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2263}} However, sometimes the [[weather front|front]] retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, resulting one or more years of [[drought]].{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}} In the northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by Sahara-Sudanese [[weather system]]s.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}} For example, between 1957 and 1968, [[Bardaï]] saw an average of {{convert|12|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, although some years were dry while others saw {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}} In general, the range receives a little less than {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year.{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2263}}{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}} However, at elevations above {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}, average precipitation exceeds {{convert|100|to|150|mm|abbr=on}} per year. When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}} This occurs, on average, once every seven years.&lt;ref name=messerli73&gt;{{cite journal |last=Messerli |first=B. |title=Problems of vertical and horizontal arrangement in the high mountains of the extreme arid zone (central Sahara) |journal=Arctic and Alpine Research |volume=5 |issue=3 |year=1973 |page=A140 |jstor=1550163 |issn=0004-0851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vegetation above {{convert|2600|m|abbr=on}} consists of dwarf shrubs, which are generally limited to {{convert|20|to|60|cm|abbr=on}} in height and do not exceed one meter. The shrubbery consists of the species ''[[Pentzia monodiana]]'', ''[[Artemisia tilhoana]]'' and ''[[Ephedra tilhoana]]''. Finally, at the highest elevation elevations of the Tibesti, [[Erica arborea|tree heath]] (''Erica arborea'') grows from moist crevices formed by early lava flows, and 24 different species of [[moss]] provide substrate for the tree heath.{{sfn|White|1998|p=243–244}}

===Population===
[[File:Massif du Tibesti topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of the Tibesti and surrounding area (in French)]]

The principal settlements in the Tibesti are [[Bardaï, Chad|Bardaï]], [[Aouzou, Chad|Aozou]] and [[Zouar, Chad|Zouar]], respectively located in the center, north and west of the range, and each situated on oases along the ''enneris''.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}} Bardaï, at an elevation of {{convert|1020|m|abbr=on}}, is the capital of Chad's [[Tibesti Region]] with around 1,500 inhabitants.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=1–3}}{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}} It is connected to Zouar by a track that crosses Tarso Toussidé. The village of Omchi is accessible from Bardaï via Aderké, or from Auzou via Irbi. These rough tracks extend southward towards Yebbi Souma and Yebbi Bou, and then follow the course of Enneri Misky.

Around a quarter of the population was located around Zouar, 18% in the center and in the northeastern valley of the Enneri Bardagué where many palm trees are cultivated, 16% in the north around Aozou and the valley of the Enneri Yebige, and 7% on the plains. The remaining third of the population was dispersed among the ''tarsos''.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=69}}

[[File:Toubou map.svg|thumb|left|Map of the [[Toubou people|Toubou]] population in Africa]]

The vast majority of the population is [[Teda people|Teda]], one of the two ethnicities of the [[Toubou people]]. However, some clans are [[Daza]], the other Toubou ethnicity, who left their traditional homes in the lowlands to the south and moved north to the Tibesti.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=2, 6}} The Toubou, in general, are semi-nomadic{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2263}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=2, 6}} and live primarily in northern Chad, but also in southern Libya and eastern Niger. The [[Tebu language|Toubou language]] has two main dialects, [[Tedaga language|Tedaga]], spoken by the Teda, and [[Dazaga language|Dazaga]], spoken by the Daza. Despite their cultural proximity, the two Toubou groups do not identify as a single ethnic group.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=70}}  The Toubou elect a chief, the ''[[Derdé]]'', from the Tomagra clan, although never from the same family consecutively.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=72–79}}&lt;ref name=baroin85&gt;{{cite book |last=Baroin |first=Catherine |title=Anarchie et cohésion sociale chez les Toubou: les Daza Kéšerda (Niger) |publisher=Editions de la Maison des sciences de l'homme |year=1985 |language=French |trans_title=Anarchy and social cohesion among the Toubou: Daza Kešerda (Niger) |isbn=978-2-7351-0095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Derdé resides in Zouar&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; and aims to impose religious and judicial authority over the Tibesti population;{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=72–79}} however, efforts toward executive cooperation and war alliances are usually destined for failure.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=38}} The descendants of previous Derdé retain authority which transfers from father to son.

==History==

===Human settlement===
[[File:Tibesti population-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of the clans of the Tibesti Mountains]]

There is evidence of human occupation of the Tibesti dating back to the [[Stone Age]], when richer paleovegetation facilitated human habitation.&lt;ref name=hagedorn97 /&gt; The Toubou settled in the region in the 5th century BC{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=36–37}} and established trade relations with the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] civilization.&lt;ref name=visiter&gt;{{cite web |title=Le Tibesti |publisher=Visiter le Tchad |url=http://visiterletchad.com/accueil/a-voir-et-a-faire/sites-touristiques/les-deserts/tibesti |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502033959/http://visiterletchad.com/accueil/a-voir-et-a-faire/sites-touristiques/les-deserts/tibesti |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, [[Herodotus]] portrayed the Toubou, which he labeled &quot;Ethiopians&quot; because of their skin color, and described as having a language akin to the &quot;cry of bats.&quot;{{sfn|Roure|1939}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=36–37}} In the 12th century, the geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] spoke of a &quot;country of [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] negroes&quot;, or camel herders, that had converted to [[Islam]]. The historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] described the Toubou in the 14th century. In the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Al-Maqrizi]] and [[Leo Africanus]] recognized the &quot;country of the Berdoa&quot;, that is to say Bardaï, the former associating the Toubou with the [[Berbers]] and the latter describing them as [[Numidian]] relatives of the [[Taureg]].{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=34–35}}

The Toubou settled in the Tibesti in several waves. Generally, newcomers either killed or absorbed the previous clans after battles that were often both long-lasting and bloody.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=81–82}} The Teda clans, considered indigenous to the area, were first established around Enneri Bardagué. Namely, these clans were the Cerdegua, Zouia, Kossseda (nicknamed ''yobat'' or &quot;hunters of well water&quot;), and possibly the Ederguia, although the Ederguia's origin may be Zaghawa and only go back to the 17th century. These clans controlled the palm groves, and made a peace pact with the Tomagra, a nearby clan of camel herders who practiced ''[[Ghazw]]''.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=72–79}} It was upon the agreement to this pact at the end of the 16th century that power was consolidated under the Derdé, the principal regulator of the clans, whose appointment is always made from the Tomagra clan.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=72–79}}&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chad: Toubou and Daza: Nomads of the Sahara |title=A Country Study: Chad |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+td0047) |lccn=89600373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of early Daza settlements in the Tibesti; however, these early clans—the Goga, Kida, Terbouna and Obokina—were assimilated into later Daza clans, who arrived in the Tibesti between the 15th and 18th centuries, having fled the [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] in the southwest after the Toubou allied with a Kanem enemy, the [[Bilala people|Bilala]].{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=72–79}} These later Daza arrivals include the Arna Souinga in the south, Gouboda in the center-west, Tchioda and Dirsina in the west, Torama in the northwest and center-east, and the Derdekichia (literally, &quot;descendants of the chief,&quot; the products of a union between an Arna Souinga and an Emmeouia) in the north. The Tibesti then played the role of an impregnable mountain stronghold for the newcomers.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=41–44}} Meanwhile, constant migration between the north and southwest of Chad, along with significant mixing of the populations, forged a significant degree of cohesion among the Toubou ethnicities. Periods of territorial expansion in the 10th and 13th centuries and periods of recession in the 15th and 16th centuries likely coincided with more or less pronounced wet and dry periods.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=72–79}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=41–44}}

Several clans with traditions similar to those of the Donzas of the [[Borkou]] region, south of the Tibesti, settled in the range in the 16th and 17th centuries. These include the Keressa and Odobaya in the west, Foctoa in the northwest and northeast, and Emmeouia in the north.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=72–79}} Several other clans—the Mogodi in the west, Terintere in the north, Tozoba in the center, and Tegua and Mada in the south—are originally clans of the Bideyat people who immigrated from the [[Ennedi Plateau]], southeast of Tibesti, around the same time. The Mada, however, have since largely emigrated to Borkou, [[Kaouar]] and [[Kanem Region|Kanem]].{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=72–79}}

The early 17th century also saw the arrival of three clans from the region of [[Kufra]] to the northeast. The Taïzera settled in the plateau in the center and west of the mass, probably fleeing the [[Arab]] push into present-day Libya. They were initially rejected by the Daza clans and lived in isolation until they began investing in the oases by planting numerous palms. The Mahadena occupy the northeast quarter of the range and are likely from the [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Jalu]] regions and thus related to the Mogharba Arab tribes, although an alternative hypothesis is that they are of Bideyat origin. Following years of conflict, a branch of the Mahadena clan, the Fortena, withdrew to the western margin of the Tibesti. The Fortena Mado (&quot;Red Fortena&quot;) settled there, while the Fortena Yasko (&quot;Black Fortena&quot;) pushed further west to Kaouar.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=72–79}}

The [[Tuareg people]] intermixed with the Toubou clans, especially with the early Goga clan, which produced the Gouboda, and with the later Arna clan, which produced the Mormorea. In both instances, the new clans were placed under the authority of [[suzerain]] clans of the traditionally [[feudal]] Tuareg, although they were eventually assimilated into the Toubou majority.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=79–81}} However, the Tuareg have not entered the Tibesti since the signing of a peace treaty that included mutual recognition of Toubou and Tuareg territories. The treaty was reaffirmed in 1820.&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt;

===Regional relations and colonization===

The  [[Ottoman Empire]] came into contact with the Toubou in 1560. Their relationship broke out into conflict in the late 17th century, with the Turks favoring the authority of local Maïna at the expense of the authority of the [[Derdé]].&lt;ref name=zouar1/&gt; In 1780, the Derdé initiated an attack against the Ottomans. The Ottoman retaliation killed 60 percent the Toubou population.&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; The Teda then began launching attacks on Turkish [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] in an effort to disrupt Ottoman trade.&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; In 1890, Maï Getty Tchénimémi established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire and began receiving firearms. Meanwhile, Derdé Chachaï allied with the [[Senussi]] Arabs and agreed that the southern half of the Tibesti could serve as a fallback base for the Senussi in their struggle against the [[French Colonial Army]].&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt;{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=64}} The Tibesi was then effectively spit two, with the &quot;pro-Maï&quot; in the southwest and the &quot;pro-Derdé&quot; in the northeast.&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; With the Derdé's blessing, the Senussi founded a [[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiya]] in Bardaï, which quickly promoted the total [[Islamization]] of the Tibesti.&lt;ref name=bearman05 /&gt;&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; At the outbreak of the [[Italo-Turkish War]], the Senussi allied with the Ottoman Empire and, at the request of the Derdé, the Turks established garrisons in Tibesti beginning in March 1911. These garrisons fell apart a few months later, and the Toubou attacked the Turkish troops.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=64}}

While the Italians occupied the [[Fezzan]], a French column entered the Tibesti in early 1914 from Kaouar,{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=64}} flouting an agreement with the Maï from the previous winter and forcing the Derdé Chachaï into exile.&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; The region was at the heart of the dispute between the colonial powers,{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=610}} with the [[Italian Empire]] to the north and [[French West Africa]] to the south. During [[World War I]], a Senussi revolt forced the Italians to temporarily withdraw from the Fezzan and the northeastern part of the range.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=64}} Maï Getty Tchénimémi allied with the supporters of the Derdé and led the resistance against the French troops until their withdrawal in 1916.&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; The Tibesti was reconquered by the [[French colonial empire]] in 1929, and the region was placed under the administration of [[French Equatorial Africa]].{{sfn|Roure|1939}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=2, 6}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=64}}

===Modern history===

====Chadian Civil War====
{{Main|Chadian Civil War (1965–79)}}
[[Chad]] gained independence from [[France]] in 1960 and in 1965 the Chadian government led by [[François Tombalbaye]] imposed its administrative and judicial authority in the Tibesti. Mere days after the withdrawal of French troops from the region rebellion erupted in Bardaï, followed by numerous small-scale clashes over subsequent months and a more famous clash again in Bardaï in September. In response, the Tombalbaye government imposed travel and trade restrictions on the [[Toubou]] and voided the traditional power of the then Derdé, [[Oueddei Kichidemi]].&lt;ref name=loc /&gt;{{sfn|Fearon et al.|2006|p=4}} Kichidemi went into exile in Libya the following year and became a national symbol in Chad for opposition to the government.&lt;ref name=loc /&gt; These events were a direct trigger of the [[First Chadian Civil War]], which lasted from 1965 to 1979.&lt;ref name=loc /&gt;{{sfn|Fearon et al.|2006|p=4}}

In 1968, the [[French Army]], at the request of Tombalbaye, intervened in an attempt to put an end to the rebellion, killing 25 rebels and 121 civilians in various towns, including Zouar.&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; However, the French leader of the intervention force, General Edouard Cortadellas, admitted that the Tibesti area was basically ungovernable, remarking, &quot;I believe we should draw a line below [the Tibetsi region] and leave them to their stones. We can never subdue them.&quot; The French therefore concentrated its intervention to the center and the east of the country, leaving the Tibesti region area largely alone.{{sfn|Fearon et al.|2006|p=6}}

In 1969, [[Goukouni Oueddei]], a Teda leader, and [[Hissène Habré]], a [[Daza]] leader, emerged from the Tibesti to form the Second Liberation Army, initially an arm of the [[National Liberation Front of Chad]] (FROLINAT) but which later broke from the group due to its close relationship with [[Libya]]. In April 1974, the Second Liberation Army captured Bardaï from the Chadian government and took hostage the French [[archeologist]] [[Françoise Claustre]], German doctor [[Christophe Staewen]] and Marc Combe, an assistant to Claustre's husband, and held them in the mountains.{{sfn|Fearon et al.|2006|p=10}}&lt;ref name=zouar2&gt;{{cite web |title=Teda, Toubou, Tubu |publisher=Zouar.net |url=http://www.zouar.net/teda.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024259/http://www.zouar.net/teda.html |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staewen's wife and two soldiers of the Chadian army were killed.&lt;ref name=zouar2 /&gt; The West German government quickly paid the ransom and Staewen was released.

====Chadian–Libyan conflict====
{{Main|Chadian–Libyan conflict}}
In 1978, Chad and Libya [[Chadian–Libyan conflict|came into conflict]] over the [[Aozou Strip]], a narrow, {{convert|114000|km2|mi2|sp=us|adj=on}} borderland that extends into the Tibesti region and is supposedly rich in [[uranium deposits]].{{sfn|Roure|1939}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=610}} Prior to this, in 1972, the Chadian government under Tombalbaye had ceded the strip to Libya in a secret agreement with Libya's leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].{{sfn|Nolutshungu|1995|p=327}} Following this agreement, Libya issued residents of the Aozou Strip Libyan identification cards.{{sfn|Fearon et al.|2006|p=10}}

Following Libya's withdrawal from southern Chad in 1982, Habré's [[Armed Forces of the North]] (FAN) took control of the entirety of Chad with the exception of the Tibesti, where Goukouni remained with his Libyan-backed [[Transitional Government of National Unity|Government of National Unity]] (GUNT) forces.{{sfn|Nolutshungu|1995|p=186}} Goukouni established a National Peace Government in Bardaï and proclaimed it the legitimate government of Chad. Habré attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti in both December 1982 and January 1983 but was repelled on both occasions. Although fighting intensified over the next several months, the mountains remained under the control of the GUNT and Libyan forces.{{sfn|Nolutshungu|1995|p=188}}

====Tibesti War====
By 1986, following a series of military defeats, the GUNT had begun to disintegrate along with relations between Goukouni and Gaddafi. In August, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, which spurred his troops to attack Libyan positions in the Tibesti, forcing their withdrawal from the mountains. In October the remnant GUNT forces pledged themselves to Habré.{{sfn|Nolutshungu|1995|p=213–214}}

Libya sought to retake Bardaï and Zouar, and sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with [[T-62]] tanks and heavy support by the [[Libyan Air Force (1951-2011)|Libyan Air Force]] into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, aided by the use of [[napalm]]. The attack ultimately backfired, however, as it resulted in the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 soldiers to support the GUNT forces.{{sfn|Nolutshungu|1995|p=214–216}}&lt;ref name=pollack&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Kenneth Pollack|Pollack, Kenneth M.]]|title=Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948–1991|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8032-3733-9 |page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Libyans were only partially repelled from the Tibesti, the campaign was a great strategic victory, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity never been seen before in Chad. After a series of defeats in northeastern Chad, Libyan forces withdrew fully from the Tibesti in March 1987.{{sfn|Nolutshungu|1995|p=215–216, 245}} Although the Tibesti has since entered an era of relative peace, the years of conflict have left the area strewn with thousands of [[landmine]]s.{{sfn|Roure|1939}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=610}}

===Scientific exploration and research===
[[File:Gustav Nachtigal 02.jpg|thumb|[[Gustav Nachtigal]], the first European  explorer of the Tibesti]]

Due to its isolation and geopolitical situation, the Tibesti Mountains were long unexplored by scientists.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=609}} The German [[Gustav Nachtigal]], dispatched by [[Otto von Bismarck]],&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; was the first European to explore, albeit with great difficulty, the Tibesti in 1869.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=10}} Prior to Nachtigal's expedition, an American along with two missionaries had attempted to enter the Tibesti range, but were killed by a Toubou warrior.&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; While Nachtigal provided an accurate description of the population, his account discouraged any new adventure into the Tibesti for over 40 years,&lt;ref name=baroin03&gt;{{cite book |last=Baroin |first=Catherine |title=Du sable sec à la montagne humide, deux terrains à l'épreuve d'une même méthodologie |publisher=Université de Paris X - Nanterre |year=2003 |language=French |trans_title=Dry sand to damp mountain, two sites tested with the same methodology |url=http://hal-paris1.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/58/05/18/PDF/HDR_SynthA_se_des_travaux.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he was convicted by the Toubou of spying for Bismarck and only released after the intervention of Maï Arami Tetimi.&lt;ref name=zouar1 /&gt; Later expeditions carried out between 1920 and 1970 yielded valuable information on the [[geology]] and [[petrology]] of the range.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=609}} The French [[anthropologist]] Charles le Cœur and his wife Margaret, a [[geographer]], lived among the Teda of Tibesti between 1933 and 1935. Le Cœur was the first to closely study the Tibesti populace, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] prevented him from publishing his research.&lt;ref name=baroin03 /&gt; French Colonel Jean Chapelle published a book on the Toubou and their lifestyle in 1957.&lt;ref name=baroin03 /&gt; In 1965, the [[Free University of Berlin]] opened a geomorphological research station in Bardaï; however, research at the station was interrupted several times due to the Chadian Civil War, and the station was ultimately closed in 1974.&lt;ref name=jäkel77&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jäkel |first=Dieter |title=The Work of the Field Station at Bardai in the Tibesti Mountains |journal=[[The Geographical Journal]] |volume=143 |issue=1 |year=1977 |pages=61, 66 |jstor=1796675 |issn=0016-7398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klitzsch04&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klitzsch |first=Eberhard H. |title=From Bardai to SFB 69: The Tibesti Research Station and Later Geoscientific Research in Northeast Africa |journal=Die Erde |volume=135 |issue=3–4 |year=2004 |page=245 |issn=0013-9998 |url=http://www.die-erde.de/DIE_ERDE_2004_3-4_Klitzsch_x.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Tibesti is one of the world's most significant examples of intracontinental volcanism, ongoing political instability and the presence of landmines means that, today, geologic research often must be conducted on the basis of satellite images and comparison with research on [[Martian volcanoes]].{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=609–610}} Little public geologic research had been conducted in the Tibesti Mountains until the work of Gourgaud and Vincent in 2004; however an expedition in 2015 sought to assess the feasibility of establishing a new geoscience research station in Bardaï.{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=610}}{{sfn|Gourgaud and Vincent|2004|p=261–290}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[University of Cologne]] |title=Scientific Exploration of the Tibesti Mountains: Cologne Researcher Headed Mission to the Peaks of the Sahara Desert |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |date=June 2, 2015 |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150602074952.htm |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climbing history===
The first mountain to be climbed by a westerner in the Tibesti was Pic Toussidé in 1869 by Gustav Nachtigal during his exploration of the area, although the peak is not technically difficult.{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2264}} In 1938, Emi Koussi was summited by [[Wilfred Thesiger]].&lt;ref name=deserts1&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilfred Thesiger (1910–2003) |publisher=Les Deserts |language=French |url=http://www.lesdeserts.com/litteraturecinema/thesiger.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peakware1&gt;{{cite web |title=Emi Koussi |publisher=Peakware |url=http://www.peakware.com/peaks.html?pk=147&amp;view=overview |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010033846/http://www.peakware.com/peaks.html?pk=147&amp;view=overview |archivedate=October 10, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sporting climb was probably that of the peak and needle of Botoum, at {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}, respectively, by a Swiss expedition led by Edouard Wyss-Dunant in 1948.{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2264}}

In 1957, P.R. Steele, R.F. Marks and W.W. Tuck of the [[University of Cambridge]] embarked on an expedition to Tarso Tieroko,{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2264}} which Thesiger had described as &quot;probably the most beautiful peak in Tibesti,&quot; and which offered an interesting climbing opportunity.&lt;ref name=steele64&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steele |first=P.R. |title=A Note on Tieroko (Tibesti Mountains) |journal=Alpine Journal |volume=69 |issue=308–309 |year=1964 |url=http://alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1964.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They started at the wadi Ybbu Bou and hired guides and camels for the three-day journey. Following a week of exploring the southern flank of the mountain and climbing the two peaks situated on a ridge to the north,{{efn|The two peaks are &quot;The Imposter&quot; and &quot;Hadrian's Peak.&quot;}} they attempted to summit Tieroko from their camp at Wadi Modra. After ascending to an elevation of {{convert|10500|ft|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, just {{convert|200|ft|disp=flip|abbr=on}} from the summit, they were faced with a vertical, crumbling rock wall, and thus were forced to descend. Following this defeat, they took the opportunity to climb Emi Koussi, 19 years after its first ascent by Thesiger, and also Pic Woubou, a prominent spire located between Bardaï and Aozou.&lt;ref name=steele64 /&gt;

In 1962, the Swiss René Dittert and Robert Gréloz scaled Ou Obou, a {{convert|1640|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} peak.{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2264}} In 1963, an Italian expedition led by [[Guido Monzino]] ascended Torre Innominata, a {{convert|970|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} aiguille of Sissé, west of [[Tarso Toussidé]].{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2264}} In 2005, Bikku Bitti was scaled by Englishman Eamon &quot;Ginge&quot; Fullen and Chadian guides.&lt;ref name=guinness1&gt;{{cite web |title=Fastest time to climb the highest peaks in all African countries |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/fastest-time-to-climb-the-highest-peaks-in-all-african-countries-/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fullen07&gt;{{cite web |last=Fullen |first=Ginge |title=Libya - Bikku Bitti |date=September 5, 2007 |publisher=SummitPost.org |url=http://www.summitpost.org/ginge-fullen/333351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the unstable political situation, the alpine conquest of the Tibesti Mountains remains very much incomplete.{{sfn|''Grande Encyclopédie''|1979|p=2264}}

Other than a nearby oasis, Mare de Zoui and its surroundings are rarely visited.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}} However, there are numerous small oases on the plains of Borkou, near Emi Koussi, which are extensively exploited.

===Agriculture===
[[File:DoumPalm1 ST 08.JPG|thumb|[[Doum palm]]s, a food source in the Tibesti]]
The oases to the west and north of the range have the easiest access. Where mosquitoes do not abound, they support several villages, such as [[Zouar]], where indigenous plant species have largely been replaced by some 56,000 [[date palm]]s (''Phoenix dactylifera'') for the production of dates.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=69}} These are harvested between late July and early August.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=70}} In winter, when reserves are depleted, it is not uncommon for the cores of the dates and the fiber of the palms to be ground into a paste and consumed.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=69}} These palm groves can also grow [[millet]] and [[corn]], but the crop is spotty and sometimes swept away by early flooding.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=70}} The banks of the ''enneris'' grow [[desert gourd]] (''Citrullus colocynthis''), which are collected in October to extract the bitter seeds which, after being washed, are ground to make [[flour]].{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=69}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=70}} [[Horticulture]] is practiced on a small scale using traditional irrigation methods.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}} Goats and, more rarely, sheep number 50,000 heads, and 8,000 camels and 7,000 donkeys are raised in the range.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=70}} Chickens are also numerous,&lt;ref name=zouar3 /&gt; although the consumption of meat is rare, usually done so through [[Salting (food)|salting]].&lt;ref name=zouar2 /&gt;

Most animals spend the winter on the plateaus or in the high valleys. They descend into the lower valleys in February, just after the sowing of wheat, and then return in June to allow harvest.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=70}} In total, including [[barley]], the Tibesti produces {{convert|300|t|ST}} of [[cereal]]s each year, which are mainly consumed in the form of cakes (''dogo'') and pancakes (''fodack'')&lt;ref name=zouar2 /&gt; and complemented with wild grasses.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=69}} Women are responsible for gathering wild grains on the ''tarsos'' in August.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=70}} Fishing is possible in the water holes.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}} On the plains of Borkou, some fields are irrigated, where cattle, goats and camels can drink. Despite the date palm plantations, native species remain, such as the [[doum palm]] (''Hyphaene thebaica''), from which the sweet bark is collected, ground and consumed, despite its low nutritional value.{{sfn|Hughes and Hughes|1992|p=18–20}} Agricultural product is traded once a year in exchange for fabrics.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=70}}

===Tourism===
[[File:Tibesti east of bardai.jpg|thumbnail|The Tibesti east of [[Bardaï]]]]

Tibesti has tourism potential, with its primary attractions being the palm groves, rock and parietal art, canyons, basalt spires, volcanoes and hot springs.&lt;ref name=zouar3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tourisme1&gt;{{cite web |title=Info voyage Tchad, séjour, circuit désert du Tchad, hôtels à N'djamena, Moundou, Sarh et Abéché au Tchad, parcs naturel Zakouma - l'ancêtre Toumai |publisher=Tourisme en Afrique |language=French |trans_title=Chad travel info, holiday, around the Chadian desert, N'djamena hotels, Moundou, Sarh and Abeche in Chad, Zokouma National Park - the ancient Toumai |url=http://www.tourisme-en-afrique.net/Pays/tchad.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909122709/http://tourisme-en-afrique.net/Pays/tchad.html |archivedate=September 9, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Zouar airfield cannot accommodate aircraft with more than a 20-seat capacity. This pushes the cost of air tickets from [[N'djamena]] up to 60 percent of the cost to fly from N'djamena to major European cities. Furthermore, tourist accommodations are virtually absent. As a result, the majority of tourists, most of whom are German, enter Libya, purchase all-terrain vehicles or caravans on the spot, and then cross the border into Chad. Thus, the economic benefits to Chad amount to only around 100 euros per tourist.{{sfn|Getty Doby|2007|p=31–34}} The presence of numerous landmines is a danger to tourists,{{sfn|Roure|1939}}{{sfn|Permenter and Oppenheimer|2007|p=610}} and thus hiking is generally limited to the southern end of the range.

==Culture==
[[File:Mathendous giraffes.jpg|thumb|[[Rock art]] in the [[Fezzan]]]]
The Tibesti Mountains are renowned for their [[rock art|rock]] and [[parietal art]]. Around 200 engraving sites—including some 1800 different representations—and 100 painting sites have been identified. Most date from between the 5th and 3rd millennia BC, although some date from the 6th millennium BC, centuries before the arrival of the Toubou. The art has suffered the effects of time, including weathering from sand blown by the wind.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=27–28}}{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=21–24}}{{sfn|Getty Doby|2007|p=13}} The earliest works often portray animals that have since died out due to climate change in the Tibesti, including elephants, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and giraffes. More recent art includes ostriches and antelopes, which have an exceptional presence on the edge of the range, as well as gazelles and sheep, which are more common.

Later works, dated less than 2000 years old, portray domesticated animals, such as oxen and camels. Other engravings portray warriors, known as ''owoza'', dressed in feathers or spiked ornaments and armed with bows, shields, [[assegai]], or traditional knives. Some portray dance scenes.{{sfn|Chapelle|2004|p=27–28}}{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=21–24}}{{sfn|Getty Doby|2007|p=13}} The walls of a canyon near Bardaï have engravings that measure over {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} in height, including that of the &quot;man of Gonoa,&quot; Gonoa being the name of the ''enneri'' that runs through the valley. These primarily show hunting scenes.{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=21–24}} The paintings, often drawn with a red ''[[Faidherbia albida]]'' base, signify a turn towards domestication in the Tibesti, because the scenes are more [[pastoral]].{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=21–24}}{{sfn|Getty Doby|2007|p=13}} The Tibesti art is unique in the Sahara because of the absence of inscriptions, the relative lack of [[chariots]], and the low representation of camels and horses until comparatively recently.{{sfn|Beauvilain|1996|p=21–24}} The art has remained important to the Toubou; around 1200 AD, a man named Yerbou engraved a palm leaf into rock, symbolizing his love for a married woman.{{sfn|Getty Doby|2007|p=14}}

[[File:007 Tibesti.JPG|thumb|left|The [[land art]] of Jean Vérame in the Tibesti]]

In 1989, French painter and sculptor [[Jean Vérame]] used the natural surroundings of the Ehi Kourné, a few kilometers south of [[Bardaï]], to create multidimensional [[land art]] works by painting rocks. The project was supported by the Chadian president and the [[United Nations Development Programme]], as well as private corporations such as the French oil company [[Total S.A.]] Over time, the [[Klein Blue]] paint turned patina white and red, and today is pinkish in color.&lt;ref name=av1&gt;{{cite web |title=Jean Verame |publisher=Encyclopedie Audiovisuelle De L'art Contemporain |language=French |url=http://imagoartvideo.perso.neuf.fr//verame.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020060822/http://imagoartvideo.perso.neuf.fr/verame.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verame1&gt;{{cite web |title=Jean Verame |publisher=JeanVerame.com |language=French |url=http://www.jeanverame.com/tibesti.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geospatial09&gt;{{cite web |title=Bardaï Mue |publisher=Geo212 |url=http://geo212.blogs.com/geospatial_air_du_temps_b/2009/05/barda%C3%AF-mue.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129050447/http://geo212.blogs.com/geospatial_air_du_temps_b/2009/05/barda%C3%AF-mue.html |archivedate=January 29, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volcanic spires of the Tibesti, along with a stylized sheep's head, were displayed on a 20 [[CFA franc]] postage stamp issued by Republic of Chad in 1961.&lt;ref name=colnect1&gt;{{cite web |title=Timbre: Head of sheep and Tibesti |publisher=Colnect.com |url=http://colnect.com/fr/stamps/stamp/244610-Head_of_sheep_and_Tibesti-Definitive_issue-Tchad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibesti range was featured in the 1966 short story &quot;Le Mura di Anagoor&quot; (&quot;The Walls of Anagoor&quot;) by the Italian novelist [[Dino Buzzati]]. In the story, a local guide offers to show a traveller the walls of a great city that is absent from the maps. The city is exceedingly opulent, yet exists in total [[autarky]] and does not submit to local authority. The traveler waits many years, in vain, to enter the Tibesti city.&lt;ref name=buzatti84&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buzatti |first1=Dino |last2=Breitman |first2=Michael |chapter=Les Murs d'Anagoor |title=Les Sept messagers: nouvelles |publisher=Union générale d'éditions |year=1984 |origyear=1966 |language=French |trans_title=The Seven Messengers: short stories |isbn=978-2-264-00478-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
