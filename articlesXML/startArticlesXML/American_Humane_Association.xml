The '''American Humane Association''' ('''AHA''') is an organization founded in 1877, dedicated to the welfare of animals and children. It was previously called the International Humane Association, before changing its name in 1878. In 1940, it became the sole monitoring body for the humane treatment of animals on the sets of Hollywood films and other broadcast productions. AHA is best known for its trademarked certification &quot;No Animals Were Harmed&quot;, which appears at the end of film or television credits. It has also run the Red Star Animal Emergency Services since 1916. In 2000, AHA formed the Farm Animal Services program, an animal welfare label system for food products. The Association is currently headquartered in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2011/02/14/american-humane-association-moving-hq.html |title=American Humane Association moving HQ from Colorado to D.C. |publisher=''[[Denver Business Journal]]'' |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a section [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/animal-protection/american-humane-association-in-washington-dc-105/tax-status |title=American Humane Association: Tax Status |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The American Humane Association began on October 9, 1877, as &quot;The International Humane Association,&quot; with the amalgamation of 27 organizations from across the US after a meeting at the Kennard House in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=Renzetti&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BOKAMXEA_jQC&amp;pg=PT57&amp;dq=american+humane+association+founding+1877 |title=Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Violence, Volume 1 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |year=2008 |author1=Claire M. Renzetti |author2=Jeffrey L. Edleson |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |isbn=9781412918008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invitation to the other groups came from the Illinois Humane Society, sent on September 15, 1877, to discuss the specific problem of farm animal maltreatment during their transport between the eastern and western US. Groups attending the meeting included associations from the [[State of New York]], [[Illinois]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Michigan]], [[Maryland]], [[Connecticut]], and [[New Hampshire]]. A group from [[Minnesota]] also pledge its support to the forthcoming results of the conference, though they could not attend, and a group from the [[Province of Quebec]] in Canada requested the proceedings be sent to them following the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5VwPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA17&amp;dq=American+Humane+Association+report+on+accident#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Humane%20Association%20report%20on%20accident&amp;f=false |title=Doings of the Annual Meeting, Volumes 1 |publisher=American Humane Association |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |year=1877 |pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Humane Association changed its name to the &quot;American Humane Association&quot; in November 1878.&lt;ref&gt;''Doings of the Annual Meeting, Volumes 1'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; New member organizations were in attendance for their second annual general meeting, held in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], also came from [[California]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maine]], [[Delaware]], and the [[District of Columbia]]. [[Canada|Canadian]] regions were also included in the Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5VwPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA17&amp;dq=American+Humane+Association+report+on+accident#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20Humane%20Association%20report%20on%20accident&amp;f=false |title=Doings of the Annual Meeting, Volumes 2 |publisher=American Humane Association |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |year=1878 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, the American Humane Association founded [[Red Star Rescue|Red Star Rescue Relief]] after the U.S. Secretary of War asked AHA to rescue injured horses on the battlefields of World War 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Floods: American Humane Association’s Red Star™ rescue team mobilizes to help animal victims|url=http://www.mars.com/global/press-center/press-list/news-releases.aspx?SiteId=94&amp;Id=5088|website=Mars.com|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, tensions within the ranks of American Humane Association members came to a head at the organization's annual meeting, as a member-nominated slate of board candidates stood for office in opposition to a board-nominated slate.  The majority of those assembled at the Atlanta, Georgia convention elected the three candidates on the member-nominated slate, J. Perry, Raymond Naramore, and Roland Smith.  In the meeting's aftermath, there were firings and resignations on the part of staff members, including Larry Andrews, Marcia Glaser, Helen Jones, and Fred Myers.  This core group went on to found a new organization, the National Humane Society, later known as [[The Humane Society of the United States]], as an alternative to AHA.&lt;ref&gt;P. Parkes and J. Sichel, The Humane Society of the United States 1954-1979: Twenty Five Years of Growth and Achievement, Washington, 1979, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Humane Association's first &quot;No Animals Were Harmed&quot; end credit was issued at the end of the movie ''The Doberman Gang'' in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;History and Milestones&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Milestones|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/who-we-are/history/|website=American Humane Association|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, The American Humane Association launched The Front Porch Project in order to prevent child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=&quot;History and Milestones&quot;/&gt;

==Charity evaluations==
The American Humane Association is a BBB accredited charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charity Review|url=http://www.give.org/charity-reviews/national/animal-protection/american-humane-association-in-washington-dc-105|website=BBB Wise Giving Alliance|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Humane Association also received a B+ rating from CharityWatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CharityWatch REPORT|url=https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/american-humane-association/44|website=CharityWatch|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red Star Animal Emergency Services==
According to the ''[[The Gettysburg Times]]'', the &quot;American Humane Association began offering animal relief in August, 1916, by accepting an invitation of the War Department to help animals used by the U.S. Army during WWI. The invitation resulted in the development of the American Red Star Animal Relief Program known today as [[Red Star Rescue|Red Star Rescue Relief]]. Since its inception, the American Humane Association’s Red Star Animal Emergency Services has responded to national and international disasters, rescuing thousands of animals.&quot;&lt;ref name=Times /&gt; Disasters where the group has rescued animals include the [[2011 Joplin tornado]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sj-r.com/joplin-tornado/x1836096863/American-Humane-Association-to-help-animal-victims-of-Joplin-disaster |title=American Humane Association to help animal victims of Joplin disaster |date=May 25, 2011 |publisher=''[[State Journal-Register]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/steve-dales-pet-world/2011/01/robin-ganzert-steers-american-humane-association-from-a-celebrated-past-into-a-promising-future/ |author =Steve Dale |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |date=January 27, 2011 |title=Robin Ganzert Steers American Humane Association from a Celebrated Past Into A Promising Future |publisher=''[[ChicagoNow]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurricane Sandy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.today.com/pets/rush-rescue-animals-stranded-sandys-wake-1C6763086?franchiseSlug=petsmain |title=Rush is on to rescue animals stranded in Sandy's wake |date=October 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |author =Laura T.

==Work in the film industry==

===Film and television unit===
The American Humane Association began its work in film in 1940, after an incident that occurred on the set of the film ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/02/130224-oscars-movies-animals-chimps-photography-pictures-dorothy-lamour-jiggs/ |title=Dorothy Lamour never got nominated for an Oscar, while a chimp never could |date=February 24, 2013 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |publisher=''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' |author =Johnna Rizzo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group began protesting the public release of the film, because of a scene where a horse was forced to run off the edge of a cliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-03-15-reel-apes-campaign_x.htm |title=Groups targeting Humane Association over treatment of apes in movies |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |author =''[[Associated Press]]'' |date=March 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horse fell over 70 feet to the ground below and broke its spine, having to be put down afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&amp;p_theme=la&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=109C92605ED69E3D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=HOLLYWOOD UNDER FIRE IN DEATH OF 2ND HORSE |publisher=''[[Daily News of Los Angeles]]'' |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the AHA’s access to some sets was diminished for 14 years following the dismantling of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Office]], during which time their jurisdiction was lessened.

By contract with the Screen Actors Guild, AHA monitors animal use on film sets.  However, the Screen Actors Guild has no jurisdiction concerning foreign and non-union productions.&lt;ref name=&quot;animalpeoplenews&quot;&gt;Animal People, 2013 Animal People Watchdog Report, 5, http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/watchdog_report.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/cruelcamera/humane.html |publisher=''[[CBC News]]'' |title=PROFILE: American Humane |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |author =''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the release of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', the opening of which was met with a national picketing and protest effort after complaints about how the filming of the movie had involved the inhumane treatment of animals – including the deaths of five horses – the [[Screen Actors Guild]] negotiated for the universal presence of AHA on the set as part of its union deal, forcing moviemakers to contact AHA in advance of any animal being present on set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XhYpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7oMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7138,69859&amp;dq=1980+heaven's+gate+american+humane+association&amp;hl=en |author =Lisa Wolfson |title=The Humane Society keeps film set abuse down |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |date=August 1, 1987 |publisher=''[[Deseret News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the American Humane Association Film and Television Unit specifically oversees animals used during media productions, and it is sanctioned by the [[Screen Actors Guild]] to oversee a production's humane care of animals. It is the only organization with jurisdiction to do so within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Gwqd60SwfYC&amp;pg=PT483&amp;dq=American+Humane+Association+film+unit |title=The Complete Film Production Handbook |author =Eve Light Honthaner |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=9781136053054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the AHA may choose to issue the end credit disclaimer &quot;No Animals Were Harmed&quot;, with a piece of a filmstrip that depicts a dog, a horse and an elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=t9tQeeP0ICUC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=No+Animals+Were+Harmed+in+the+Making+of+This+Motion+Picture#v=onepage&amp;q=No%20Animals%20Were%20Harmed%20in%20the%20Making%20of%20This%20Motion%20Picture&amp;f=false |page=160 |title=Empire Movie Miscellany: Instant Film Buff Status Guaranteed |year=2012 |publisher=[[Random House]] |author =''[[Empire Magazine]]'' |isbn=9781448132911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AHA also  reports on animal safety during filming if public concerns arise or if animal accidents happen on the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/10/26/american_humane_investigates_horse_death |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |title=American Humane Investigates Horse Injury on Set of Russell Crowe's '3:10 To Yuma' |date=October 26, 2006 |publisher=''Star Pulse''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Humane Association protects the animals on the set as well as the cast/crew members who interact with the animals. According to the AHA, they ensure that budgets and time constraints do not compromise the safety or care of the animals.&lt;ref name=bro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanefilmtv.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/pya-brochure.pdf |page=4 |title=Protecting Your Ass* From Harm |author =American Human Association |publisher=American Human Film &amp; Television Units |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidelines===
The AHA's standard of animal care is outlined in the Guidelines for the Safe Use of Animals in Filmed Media, which were established in 1988. It covers large animals, as well as fish, insects, birds, reptiles, and any other living creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J7ATQb6LZX0C&amp;pg=PT704&amp;dq=Guidelines+for+the+Safe+Use+of+Animals+in+Filmed+Media |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |title=The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined |author =Steven Pinker |year=2011 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |isbn=9781101544648}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the set, AHA's Certified Animal Safety Representatives attempt to ensure the Guidelines are upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8zPLTtjCGAsC&amp;pg=PT309&amp;dq=Certified+Animal+Safety+Representatives |title=Writing Movies for Fun and Profit: How We Made a Billion Dollars at the Box Office and You Can, Too! |author =Thomas Lennonand Robert B Garant |year=2011 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=1439186774}}&lt;/ref&gt; AHA's oversight includes film, television, commercials, music videos, and Internet productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elayne-boosler/american-humane-associatin-animal-cruelty_b_1383481.html |date=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |author =Elayne Boosler |title=Yes, Animals Were Harmed in the Making of This Motion Picture |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In the late 1980s, the Association was accused by [[Bob Barker]] and the [[United Activists for Animal Rights]] of condoning animal cruelty on the set of ''[[Project X (1987 film)|Project X]]'' and in several other media projects. The basis of the accusation was the allowing of a [[cattle prod]] and a gun on set, and the rumored beating of the chimpanzee on set. The Association responded by launching a $10 million suit for [[Defamation|libel, slander]] and [[expectation of privacy|invasion of privacy]] against Mr. Barker.&lt;ref name=SFH&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20121207,00.html |title=Speaking Up for 'Abused' Animals, Bob Barker Is Hit with a Lawsuit |publisher=''[[People Magazine]]'' |date=September 18, 1989 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |author1=Lucinda Smith |author2=Leah Feldon |author3=Eleanor Hoover }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Humane Association claimed that there had been a two-year &quot;[[feud|vendetta]]&quot; against them behind the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19890830&amp;id=kPwRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DPADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5267,6009396 |title=Game Show Host Sued For Libel |publisher=''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'' |date=August 31, 1989 |author =''[[Associated Press]]'' |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |page=A7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a series of public ads along with the $10 million libel suit, the Association stated that the allegations were made based on insufficient and misleading information.&lt;ref name=SFH /&gt; The suit was eventually settled by Barker's insurance company, which paid AHA $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&amp;p_theme=la&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF66A158B43F4AC&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=ANIMAL BOARD OFFICIAL SEEKS CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST PROBE |date=March 30, 1994 |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |publisher=''[[Daily News of Los Angeles]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported, in 2001, that the AHA Film Unit &quot;has been slow to criticize cases of animal mistreatment, yet quick to defend the big-budget studios it is supposed to police,&quot; and that an examination of the Association &quot;also raises questions about the association's effectiveness.&quot; The article cites numerous cases of animals injured during filming which the AHA may have overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/09/news/mn-23161 |title=Questions Raised About Group That Watches Out for Animals in Movies |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=February 9, 2001 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |author1=Ralph Frammolino |author2=James Bates }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' ran a story which implicated the AHA in turning a blind eye to and underreporting incidents of animal abuse on television and movie sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRAnimalsHarmed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last= Baum |first= Gary |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/feature/ |title=Animals Were Harmed: Hollywood's Nightmare of Death, Injury, and Secrecy Exposed &amp;#124; Hollywood Reporter Exclusive |publisher= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= 2013-11-25 |accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, during the filming of ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', 27 animals died.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRAnimalsHarmed&quot; /&gt;  Nevertheless, the movie received a &quot;no animals were harmed&quot; disclaimer.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRAnimalsHarmed&quot; /&gt;  During the filming of the movie [[Life of Pi]], the tiger &quot;King&quot; nearly drowned in a pool, yet this incident was not reported outside of the AHA organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRAnimalsHarmed&quot; /&gt;

==Recent programs==

===Humane Heartland===

In 2000, the American Humane Association's Farm Animals Services program created the first farm animal welfare label to be overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The program began as &quot;Free Farmed&quot; under Adele Douglass, who left AHA in 2003, to found Humane Farm Animal Care. AHA's program is now called &quot;Humane Heartland.&quot;

The American Humane Association certifies farms after evaluating them on a five point criteria. The criteria demands that the animals are free from hunger, discomfort, pain, and fear, and that the animals are able to express normal behaviors. Farms that meet this criteria receive an [[American Humane Certified]] label.&lt;ref name=&quot;growinggeorgia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=American Humane Association Certifies the Welfare of Nearly One Billion Farm Animals|url=http://growinggeorgia.com/news/2013/09/american-humane-association-certifies-welfare-nearly-one-billion-farm-animals/|website=Growing Georgia|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past four years, the number of American Humane Certified animals has jumped more than 1,000%. Over 1 billion animals are now [[American Humane Certified]].&lt;ref name=&quot;growinggeorgia.com&quot;/&gt; As of July 2012, it claimed to include 100 major producers, representing approximately 500 farms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Humane's CEO Predicts Continued Intensive Animal Agriculture, But With Significant Humane Improvements|url=http://www.fox19.com/story/11608740/american-humanes-ceo-predicts-continued-intensive-animal-agriculture-but-with-significant-humane-improvements|website=Fox 19|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and more than 135 million animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Talk Cheap in Farm Animal Welfare?|url=http://www.causematters.com/agriculture/farm-animal-welfare/|website=Cause Matters Corp|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auditing is done by the AHA, with the USDA also auditing the certifications to ensure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/20/business/fi-23819 |title=New Food Label to Certify Humane Treatment of Animals |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |author =Melinda Fulmer |date=September 20, 2000 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standards and Guidelines|url=http://awic.nal.usda.gov/farm-animals/animal-welfare-audits-and-certification-programs/animal-welfare-audits-and-1|website=USDA|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label informs purchasers that the AHA has found that the animals were not subjected to unnecessary pain, distress, or fear while being raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB715AB683A64B4&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=LABEL INDICATES HUMANE TREATMENT,  'FREE FARMED' FOODS MEAN PRODUCERS ARE KIND TO ANIMALS |publisher=''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' |date=September 20, 2000 |accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of what the program demands is the implementation of minimum space requirements per animal on a farm or in farming facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/dining/17eggs.html?_r=2&amp; |title=Sorting Through the Claims of the Boastful Egg |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |author =Catherine Price |date=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Humane Association currently certifies approximately 90 percent of cage-free eggs sold in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Happy Egg Co Receives AHA Certification |url=http://www.groceryheadquarters.com/2015/01/happy-egg-co-receives-aha-certification/ |website=Grocery Headquarters |accessdate=3 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402161125/http://www.groceryheadquarters.com/2015/01/happy-egg-co-receives-aha-certification/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Foster Farms earned the [[American Humane Certified]] designation from AHA for its handling of poultry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Humane® Certified FAQ |url=http://www.fosterfarms.com/faq/ahc.asp |website=Foster Farms |accessdate=3 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311025604/http://www.fosterfarms.com:80/faq/ahc.asp |archivedate=11 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
In June 2015, [[Mercy for Animals]] released a video of an undercover investigation of several Foster Farms poultry facilities certified as &quot;humane&quot; by AHA. The footage included workers treating the chickens violently and using inhumane slaughter methods; this resulted in Mercy for Animals calling AHA's certification program &quot;a scam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American Humane Association Slammed For Awarding 'Humane' Certification To Slaughterhouse Caught On Video Torturing Animals|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-humane-association-slammed-for-awarding-humane-certification-to-slaughterhouse-caught-on-video-torturing-animals-300100453.html|author=[[Mercy for Animals]]|agency=[[PR Newswire]]|accessdate=2016-06-22|date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Humane Association Hero Dog Awards===
Each year a series of dogs are awarded the Hero Dog Awards, given to dogs that have contributed substantially to human society. There are several categories in which dogs can be nominated, including the Military Dog category. The grand prize for the American Hero Dog was $10,000, which is given to a charity that reflects the contributions of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/military-heroes-hero-dogs/story?id=17237475#.UOSW_KzheSo |title=Military Heroes and Their Hero Dogs |date=September 19, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |author =Christina Ng |publisher=''[[ABC World News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 and 2012 the awards were broadcast on the [[Hallmark Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/post.aspx?Kristin_Chenoweth_to_host_Hero_Dog_Awards_show_/29-17101 |title=Kristin Chenoweth to host 'Hero Dog Awards' show |publisher=''[[Tulsa World]]'' |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |date=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first winner of the national award was a dog named Roselle, who led his blind owner down from the 78th floor of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks. There were more than 400,000 votes cast in the online poll that determined the winner. Unfortunately Roselle died several months before the winner was announced. The award was given on November 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sectionfront/life/pet-tales-heroes-in-the-spotlight-guide-dog-honored-for-leading-her-human-to-safety-on-911-321405/ |author =Linda Wilson Fuoco |publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' |title=Pet Tales -- Heroes in the spotlight: Guide dog honored for leading her human to safety on 9/11 |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |date=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child welfare services==

The American Humane Association has several initiatives to improve child welfare services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/children/|website=American Humane|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front Porch Project===
The American Humane Association launched the Front Porch Project in 1997 in order to prevent child abuse and neglect. The American Humane Association works through 'sustainer' organizations in local communities in order to intervene on behalf of at-risk and abused children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatherhood Initiative|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/children/programs/fatherhood-initiative/|website=American Humane Association|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to building a network of community trainers, the Front Porch Project also invests in evaluating the performance of their initiatives in each of the communities they operate in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children|url=http://americanhumane.org/children/|website=American Humane Association|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Fatherhood Initiative===

The American Humane Association launched the Fatherhood Initiative in order to develop better methods of engaging non-resident fathers with children who are in the welfare system. The project researches the impact of non-resident fathers on their children, and examines how to foster or improve their relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;calswec.berkeley.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Worker Training Curriculum: Engaging the Non-Resident Father|url=http://calswec.berkeley.edu/files/uploads/qic-nrf_curric.pdf|website=Berkeley.edu|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fatherhood Initiative also provides information to caseworkers on techniques to identify and locate non-resident fathers.&lt;ref name=&quot;calswec.berkeley.edu&quot;/&gt;

==Governance and finances==

AHA's budget for 2013 was just over $13 million. Their total revenue was $13.4 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Compassion Brochure&quot;/&gt;

The organization closed its Denver, Colorado office in 2011 and moved its operations to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Humane Association moving HQ from Colorado to D.C.|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2011/02/14/american-humane-association-moving-hq.html|publisher=Denver Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Bruner, the board chair of the organization, resigned in January 2013 amidst revelations that AHA paid $233,863 to his business partner, Gregory Dew, for unspecified consulting services.  Dew was the highest paid AHA &quot;independent contractor&quot; in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2011, according to filings the charity submitted to the IRS&lt;ref name=&quot;animalpeoplenews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/09/entertainment/la-et-ct-aha-chair-resignation-20130109 |title=American Humane Assn. board Chairman Eric Bruner resigns - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employees==

In 2004, Marie Belew Wheatley became executive director of the AHA.  She left to become the executive director of the Colorado Ballet, in 2010, and left the Colorado Ballet in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =Kyle MacMillan |url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_15905374 |title=With new director, ballet seeks financial stability |publisher=The Denver Post |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
