===Conception===
In January 2015, another installment of the ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' franchise was pitched by executive producers [[Howard Gordon]], [[Evan Katz]], [[Manny Coto]] and [[Brian Grazer]]. It revolves around a stable of supporting characters rather than [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as [[Jack Bauer]] in the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/fox-tca-more-24-x-files-prison-break-executives-1201407936/ |title=Fox TCA: New Chiefs Talk More ''24'', Brand-Building and Destiny-Controlling? |work=Variety |first=Cynthia |last=Littleton |date=January 17, 2015 |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Fox announced the continued development of a new version of ''24''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/fox_developing_another_season_24-2015-05 |title=FOX developing another season of '24' |publisher=Zap2it |first=Andrea |last=Reiher |date=May 11, 2015 |accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Howard Gordon stated that a spin-off would feature a new young male lead, alongside a slightly older, more experienced, female agent. Evan Katz and Manny Coto are confirmed to return as writers and executive producers. It is confirmed that this spin-off includes the &quot;real time&quot; feature as Gordon says it is the tradition of the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;writing&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2015/06/01/24-spinoff-fox-new-character-2016-kiefer-sutherland/ |title=''24'' Spinoff at Fox Would Revolve Around a New Male Character |publisher=TVLine |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |date=June 1, 2015 |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kiefer Sutherland 2 SDCC 2014.jpg|right|thumb|140px|[[Kiefer Sutherland]] announced that he wouldn't appear in ''24: Legacy'' as [[Jack Bauer]].]]
In June 2015, Sutherland said, when asked about the future of Jack Bauer, &quot;I am not coming back to do ''24''{{-&quot;}}. Sutherland said that {{-&quot;}}''24'' is such a great idea, that this could go on forever&quot;. Sutherland said he felt it was important to have a new cast to keep the series and he hopes to maybe have a cameo in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldderby.com/news/9505/kiefer-sutherland-jack-bauer-24-live-another-day-emmys-entertainment-13579086-story.html |title=Kiefer Sutherland drops bombshell: 'I am not coming back to do ''24''{{'}} (Podcast) |publisher=GoldDerby |first=Marcus James |last=Dixon |date=June 12, 2015 |accessdate=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Sutherland seemingly ruled out any further involvement with the show, stating that he would &quot;definitely not return in any way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34402671 |title=Kiefer Sutherland rules out 24 return |publisher=BBC |first=Emma |last=Jones |date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, Sutherland said regarding about possibly returning to ''24'': &quot;I've learned enough over the last few years to not say never. We were never going to do a season nine when we finished after the eighth season. I said we were done. So I'm going to just say we'll see.&quot; He also said regarding the ''Legacy'' pilot script that it is &quot;really cool&quot; and that he would be the &quot;first person to watch it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24spoilers.com/2016/02/18/kiefer-sutherland-24-legacy-script/|title=Kiefer Sutherland says 24: ''Legacy'' script is 'really cool'|publisher=24 Spoilers|date=February 18, 2016|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
In June 2015, Howard Gordon stated that a spin-off would feature a new young male lead, alongside a slightly older, more experienced, female agent. Evan Katz and Manny Coto are confirmed to return as writers and executive producers. It is confirmed that this spin-off includes the &quot;real time&quot; feature as Gordon says it is the tradition of the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;writing&quot; /&gt; Katz stated in an interview that it took eight months to write the first script for the first episode. He stated that one of the difficulties was that &quot;It had to meet people's expectations, which were high and should have been high.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;digital spy&quot; /&gt; He also revealed that the show begins three years after the events in ''[[24: Live Another Day]]'' and will be set in [[Washington, D.C.]] The series will introduce CTU's national headquarters located in Washington, D.C. CTU offices located in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]] have previously been shown on ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;digital spy&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;location&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/05/the-case-for-why-fox-should-premiere-24-legacy-behind-the-super-bowl-290692/|title=

In an interview with ''[[Newsday]]'', showrunner Howard Gordon talked about the conception of the show as he said: 

{{cquote|Manny [et al.] had an idea that was not a '24' idea, but as we talked, we thought, wow, maybe we could roll up with this character who was based on a real story—the special ops team which killed Osama bin Laden, and then came back to the states, where their identities were obscured and had a tough time adjusting. That was the premise of the character, and we realized he could be interesting with that as the focal point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/24-legacy-showrunner-howard-gordon-talks-new-spinoff-1.12170165|title='24: Legacy' showrunner, Howard Gordon, talks new spinoff|work=Newsday|last=Gay|first=Verne|date=August 12, 2016|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], the producers called the series &quot;an expansion of the 24 universe,” rather than a reboot of the original series.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDCC&quot; /&gt; The producers revealed that they had chosen a new main character rather than Jack Bauer for the series as they felt they &quot;had exhausted the former CTU agent’s story&quot;. [[Executive producer]] Gordon commented that &quot;The groundwork that started the series is that we all felt Jack Bauer told his story with ''Live Another Day''. Kiefer read the script after it was written and saw the pilot after it was shot and loved it.”&lt;ref name=&quot;SDCC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/24/comic-con-2016-24-legacy-panel|title=Comic-Con 2016: 24: Legacy exists in same Jack Bauer universe|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|date=July 24, 2016|accessdate=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a presidential election plot, the producers decided to be neutral in referencing [[United States presidential election, 2016|real-life presidential candidates]]. [[Evan Katz]] explained that &quot;You never know who’s affiliated with what. We started writing it before it was clear who the frontrunners would be, so it’s really neutral in that way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;5 things&quot; /&gt;
