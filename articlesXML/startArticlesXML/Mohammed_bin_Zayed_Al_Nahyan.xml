==Political and business career==
In November 2003, his father Zayed bin Sultan appointed Sheikh Mohammed as Deputy Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref name=gsn12nov&gt;{{cite journal|title=With MBZ’s promotion, Sheikha Fatima sons take centre stage|journal=Gulf States Newsletter|date=12 November 2003|volume=724|url=http://www.gsn-online.com/with-mbz%E2%80%99s-promotion-sheikha-fatima-sons-take-centre-stage-20031112|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of his father, Al-Nayhan became Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in November 2004 and was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces in January 2005. Later that month, he was promoted to the rank of General. Since December 2004 he has also been the Chairman of the [[Abu Dhabi Executive Council]], which is responsible for the development and planning of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and is a member of the [[ADNOC|Supreme Petroleum Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnoc.ae/Content.aspx?newid=24&amp;mid=24|title=Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) - The Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC)|publisher=ADNOC|date=25 June 2011|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves as a special adviser to the President of the UAE, [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan]], his older brother. He is also head of the Abu Dhabi council for economic development (ADCED), which is the economic policy advisory council in Abu Dhabi.

Al-Nahyan is also the head of the [[Mubadala Development Company]] which, since its establishment in 2002, represents the main investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi. Al-Nahyan is also a Director of the [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]], the [[Sovereign wealth fund]] of Abu Dhabi.

In addition, he is the head of the UAE offsets programme bureau and is the head of the [[Abu Dhabi Education Council]] which was established in 2005. His efforts in the realm of economic development are aimed at increasing economic diversification in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. As the head of the UAE offsets group, Al-Nahyan is involved with the task of channelling defence-related investments into profitable projects across different sectors in order to help diversify the economy of the UAE.&lt;ref name=&quot;abudhabi.ae&quot;&gt;[http://www.abudhabi.ae/egovPoolPortal_WAR/appmanager/ADeGP/Citizen?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=P2401345751200487093469&amp;lang=en&amp;did=148756 His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan] Abu Dhabi&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the first group of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed University scholars were selected as part of an initiative with [[New York University Abu Dhabi]], recognising outstanding students in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and providing them with special academic and leadership opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First group selected as Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed University scholars |newspaper=AMEinfo |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/164398.html |accessdate=23 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108043731/http://www.ameinfo.com/164398.html |archivedate=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2009 saw Al-Nayhan and then President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] of France inaugurate an exhibition at the [[Emirates Palace Hotel]], which included works of art purchased for the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]], as well as loans from the French national museums to mark the beginning of the construction work of the Louvre outpost, located in the cultural district in [[Saadiyat Island]]. Al-Nayhan also stated that he was confident that the [[Guggenheim Abu Dhabi]] would be able to &quot;accumulate a prestigious art collection&quot; by the time of its opening in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ptashchenko2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Nadia Ptashchenko|title=Art Mobility Between Museums in Europe: A Case Study of the Hermitage Amsterdam and the Guggenheim Bilbao|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRiDpL43T1kC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=21 March 2012|date=8 July 2009|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-36824-2|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Al-Nayhan and UAE Foreign Minister [[Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan]] welcomed [[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Prince Philip]], [[Duke of Edinburgh]] to the UAE for their second state visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mitya Underwood |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sheikh-mohammed-welcomes-back-old-friends-to-capital|title=Sheikh Mohammed welcomes back old friends to capital|newspaper=The National|date=13 November 2012|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mohammedbinzayed.com/site/en/news_show.php?n_id=284 H.H.

[[File:SheikMohammedNSS2012.jpg|250px|thumb|Sheikh Mohammed representing UAE in the [[Nuclear Security Summit (2012)|NSS 2012]]]]
He represented the United Arab Emirates in the [[Nuclear Security Summit]] of [[2012 Nuclear Security Summit|2012]] and [[2014 Nuclear Security Summit|2014]], which were hosted by South Korea and the Netherlands respectively.

==UAE Government Summit 2015==
Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan was invited as a key speaker in the government summit 2015. He gave the opening speech which was the first time he spoke officially to the nation regarding UAE matters. His opening address &quot;went beyond communicating to other government leaders and offered a vision for all Emiratis and residents of the UAE. It was an inspiring speech from someone whose voice is perhaps not heard frequently enough in public.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/editorial/sheikh-mohammed-bin-zayeds-inspirational-vision-for-a-post-oil-uae|title=Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed’s inspirational vision for a post-oil UAE|publisher=The National|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He shared a vision of the UAE post oil age, which inspired everyone and motivated the nation to look forward that date in 50 years.

==Interests, activities and philanthropic work==
[[File:Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on 13 May 2008 Pict 3.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Al-Nahyan at the Cityscape Abu Dhabi in 2008]]
Mohammed Bin Zayed is actively engaged in several projects targeted at increasing the welfare of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. He has initiated projects in various areas, such as economic development, education and environmental protection.

He also heads the [[Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund]], a philanthropic endowment established to provide targeted grants to individual species conservation initiatives, recognise leaders in the field of species conservation and elevate the importance of species in the broader conservation debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbzspeciesconservation.org/|title=What is the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund?|publisher=Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in the realm of humanitarian affairs, Al-Nahyan has been underlining his commitment to the fight against human trafficking by funding the 'Global Report on Trafficking Persons' through a Dh55 million donation to the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/Statement_of_the_minister_of_state_for_foreign_affairs_before_HRC/34855.htm|title=Statement of the minister of state for foreign affairs before HRCUAE|newspaper=UAE interact|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''UAE Yearbook 2010, Trident Press Ltd, 2010, p. 182''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Al-Nahyan and the [[Gates Foundation]] pledged $50 million each to fund the purchase and delivery of vaccines for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Gates&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foundationcenter.org/pnd/news/story.jhtml?id=324000009| title=Gates Foundation, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan Pledge $100 Million for Disease Prevention|publisher=Philanthropy News Digest|accessdate=22 February 2012|date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of interest of Al-Nahyan is the education sector. His activities in this field include his role as President of the Emirates Centre for Strategic Studies and Research (ECSSR). The centre is dedicated to the publication of academic analyses on topics relevant to the region. In the area of school curricula and higher education, Al-Nahyan is also Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC), which was founded in 2005. [[File:Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on 13 May 2008 Pict 1.jpg|thumb|220px|Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan at the Cityscape Abu Dhabi 2008]]

ADEC monitors and develops the educational system of the Emirate. Methods of the council’s work include running surveys, aiming at an integration of students and parents in assessment processes and increasing the exchange of ideas with international educational institutions in order to foster development in the educational sector.

In addition, Mohammed Bin Zayed is committed to environmental protection. He set up the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund motivated by his interest in the preservation and protection, both locally and on an international level, of endangered species and plants. A passionate falconer himself, Al-Nahyan is committed to the protection of falcons, as well as other species, including the Oryx and the Houbara from Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;abudhabi.ae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbzspeciesconservation.org/the-donor.php |title=The Donor|publisher=The Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with his dedication to environment protection, he has also taken a lead in alternative energy projects in Abu Dhabi, primarily Masdar City.&lt;ref name=&quot;abudhabi.ae&quot;/&gt;
