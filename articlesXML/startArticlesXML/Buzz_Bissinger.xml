==Journalism==

In 1987, while writing for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]],'' Bissinger won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting]] for his story on corruption in the [[Philadelphia]] court system.

In 1998 his article &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, an exposé of the career of ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' writer [[Stephen Glass]], was published in the magazine ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]],'' where he is a contributing editor. The article was later adapted for the 2003 [[Shattered Glass (film)|film of the same name]].

Bissinger's July 2015 Vanity Fair cover story &quot;Call Me Caitlyn,&quot; on the transition of former Olympic decathlete, businessperson, and television personality Bruce Jenner to [[Caitlyn Jenner]] star of [[E!|E!'s]] ''[[Keeping Up With the Kardashians]]'' and ''[[I Am Cait]]'', with photographs by Annie Leibovitz, was one of the biggest international scoops in years. Bissinger had exclusive access to Jenner both immediately before and after her cosmetic surgery. The 11,000-word article was months in the making and kept heavily under wraps until it was released on the magazine's website on June 1.

Bissinger's article for ''Vanity Fair'', &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (August 2007), about the saga of 2006 [[Kentucky Derby]] Winner [[Barbaro]], has been optioned by Universal Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bissinger |first=Buzz |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/fame/features/2007/08/barbaro200708 |title=Gone Like the Wind &amp;#124; Culture |work=Vanity Fair |date=October 20, 2009 |accessdate=September 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217195110/http://www.vanityfair.com:80/fame/features/2007/08/barbaro200708 |archivedate=February 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His magazine work has also appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.

In 2008, Bissinger wrote &quot;The Throwback,&quot; an online sports column for ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/26/opinion/26bissinger.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=The+Throwback&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=All-Stars and Layoffs | first=Buzz | last=Bissinger | date=July 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bissinger also served as a columnist at ''[[The Daily Beast]]''. On Oct. 8, 2012, Bissinger endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] for president.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/08/buzz-bissinger-why-i-m-voting-for-mitt-romney.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He briefly hosted a daily radio talk show on WPHT Philadelphia 1210 with Steve Martorano.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-06-12/news/32195987_1_philadelphia-international-flower-show-buzz-bissinger-steve-martorano | work=philly.com |title=Buzz Bissinger joins Steve Martorano on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT |date=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Bissinger is perhaps best known for his book ''Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream'', which documents the 1988 season of the [[American football|football]] team of [[Permian High School]] in [[Odessa, Texas]]. This work was the inspiration for the 1993 television series ''[[Against the Grain (TV series)|Against the Grain]]'', and was turned into a successful [[Friday Night Lights (film)|film]] (which was released in October 2004), and a [[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|television series]] which debuted on [[NBC]] on October 3, 2006. The book has sold nearly two million copies. In a list of the one hundred best books on sports ever, ''Sports Illustrated'' ranked ''Friday Night Lights'' fourth and the best ever on football. ESPN called ''Friday Night Lights'' the best book on sports over the past quarter-century.

''A Prayer for the City'', published in 1998, offers insight into the urban political scene of Philadelphia during Mayor (who later became the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] until 2011) [[Ed Rendell]]'s term in the 1990s.

The ''New York Times''' bestselling ''Three Nights in August'', published in 2005, chronicles a series in August 2003 between the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]] through the perspective of Cardinals manager [[Tony La Russa]].

''Shooting Stars'' was published by Penguin Press in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buzzbissinger.com/shooting-stars.html |title=Shooting Stars &amp;#124; Written by Lebron James and Buzz Bissinger |publisher=Buzzbissinger.com |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, co-authored with basketball superstar [[LeBron James]], tells the story of James' high school career where he and his four best friends won a championship in basketball.  As part of the promotion of ''Shooting Stars'', Bissinger appeared as a &quot;Guest Commenter&quot; on a [[Deadspin]] post on Oct. 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/5372153/book-excerpts-that-dont-suck-shooting-stars |title=Book Excerpts That Don't Suck: Shooting Stars |publisher=Deadspin.com |date=October 1, 2009 |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 Bissinger released ''[[After Friday Night Lights]]'', a sequel to ''Friday Night Lights'' which focuses on Bissinger's relationship with James &quot;Boobie&quot; Miles, a major character in his first book.

''Father's Day'', published in May 2012 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is a memoir that revolves around a singular cross-country road trip taken with one of his twin sons, Zach, an autistic savant.

==Personal life==
Bissinger is married to Lisa C. Smith, a former Assistant Vice Chancellor of [[New York University Abu Dhabi|NYU Abu Dhabi]], and has three sons. A resident of Washington state, he divides his time between homes in Philadelphia and the [[Pacific Northwest]].

In a column published in ''[[GQ]]'', Bissinger states he is a [[Compulsive buying disorder|shopaholic]] with an obsession for expensive designer clothes, spending $638,412.97 between 2010 and 2012.
