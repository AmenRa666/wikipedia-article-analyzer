'''Geoff Berner''' (born 1971, in [[Vancouver]]) is a Canadian [[singer]]-[[songwriter]], [[accordion]] player, TV writer and novelist from Vancouver, [[British Columbia]].

Berner has gained a cult following over the years, especially in Canada and [[Norway]], where he recorded his first [[live album]], ''Live in Oslo'' (2004).

==Musical career==
Berner, in his youth, studied the piano. At a party, somebody asked him why he did not play the accordion. As a result, he began learning how to play the accordion.

Following several years fronting the [[Punk rock|punk]] band ''Terror of Tiny Town'' (its name borrowed from [[The Terror of Tiny Town|the 1938 film]]), Berner released his first solo EP, ''Light Enough to Travel'' (2000) on the [[Sudden Death Records]] label. ''Light Enough to Travel'' contained some of the songs he wrote while part of The Terror of Tiny Town. The Vancouver band [[The Be Good Tanyas]] covered the title track, and had some chart success with their version in England, which helped to kickstart Berner's career. In 2000, Berner was deported to Norway, where he discovered the Norwegian band [[Kaizers Orchestra]], for whom he would later become a support act. His first full-length album, ''[[We Shall Not Flag or Fail, We Shall Go On to the End]]'' (2003) featured the track &quot;We All Gotta Be a Prostitute Sometimes&quot;, which has been [[cover version|covered]] by a surprising number of artists, considering Berner's relative obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barclay |first=Michael |url=http://exclaim.ca/MusicSchool/WhatIPlay/geoff_berner |title=Geoff Berner |website=Exclaim.ca |date=2007-02-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years between ''We Shall Not Flag or Fail, We Shall Go On to the End'' and 2005, Berner travelled to [[Romania]], to study the traditional musical style [[klezmer]], from the many talented masters in Romania. In Romania, he suffered a severe gastrointestinal infection and was rushed to a Romanian hospital, which inspired him to write &quot;Song Written in a Romanian Hospital&quot;. After his return, Berner released his second studio album, ''Whiskey Rabbi'' (2005) on [[Black Hen Music]], with the help of Diona Davies of [[Po' Girl]], on the violin, and Wayne Adams of [[Zolty Cracker]], percussion. They would later join him occasionally on tour. ''Whiskey Rabbi'' is the first of a trilogy of [[klezmer]]-themed records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straight.com/article-74904/geoff-berner-squeezes-out-songs-and-stories |title=Geoff Berner squeezes out songs and stories &amp;#124; Georgia Straight Vancouver's News &amp; Entertainment Weekly |website=Straight.com |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berner released a humorous instructional booklet called ''How to be an Accordion Player'' in 2006. In 2007, Berner released ''The Wedding Dance of the Widow Bride'', a [[concept album]] with the theme of [[marriage]], and second in his planned trilogy of [[klezmer]] records. He also collaborated with the Norwegian band &quot;Girl from Saskatoon&quot; on their 2007 album.

In 2008, he released &quot;Official Theme Song for the 2010 Vancouver / Whistler Olympic Games (The Dead Children Were Worth It!)&quot;, a satirical song he promoted as the official theme song for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], as an mp3 on February 19, 2008. The song asserts that, in order to help pay for the games, the government of British Columbia closed a provincial [[coroner]]'s office which investigated the deaths of children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartattack.com/news/53292/geoff-berner-reminds-people-of-dead-children-in-olympic-theme-song] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later attracted controversy at the [[Winnipeg Folk Festival]] in July when he opened his set with a performance of &quot;The Dead Children Were Worth It!&quot;, followed by a joke which linked the festival's corporate sponsor, [[Volkswagen]], to [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/32948774.html |title=Singer skewers sponsor |newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date=2008-07-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 he released ''Klezmer Mongrels'', the third album in his klezmer trilogy. Later in the year, Berner and colleague [[Bob Wiseman]] were given the [[Freedom of the City|Key to the City]] of [[Bruno, Saskatchewan]].

== Personal life ==
Berner is the stepfather of actress [[Genevieve Buechner]], and father of Margot Berner and Joseph Zeidler-Berner. He is also close friends with [[United States|American]] [[ukulele]] player [[Carmaig de Forest]], and covers his compositions regularly on tour, and recorded his song &quot;In the Year 2020&quot; on his ''We Shall Not Flag or Fail, We Shall Go On to the End'' album. In 2008, he began covering songwriter Kris Demeanor instead of de Forest, and Demeanor's song &quot;One Shoe&quot; appears on the ''Klezmer Mongrels'' album.  Additionally, Berner also often collaborates with fellow Canadian [[Carolyn Mark]], and recorded a duet with her, for her ''Just Married: An Album of Duets'' album in 2005.

Berner is Jewish, which is reflected in his [[klezmer]] song &quot;Lucky God Damn Jew&quot;.&lt;ref name=heebmag_interview&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson|first=Libby|title=&quot;Lucky Jew&quot;: An Interview With Geoff Berner|url=http://heebmagazine.com/lucky-jew-an-interview-with-geoff-berner/15834|work=[[Heeb Magazine]]|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Between 1988 and 2001, Berner was active in the [[Green Party of British Columbia]] and was a member of former leader [[Stuart Parker (politician)|Stuart Parker]]'s inner circle. He ran as a candidate at the federal and provincial levels in the general elections of 1991, 1993, 1996 and 1997.

His most high-profile campaign, however, was as a candidate for the satirical [[Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–1993)|Rhinoceros Party of Canada]] in the 2001 provincial general election against future premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]]. His main campaign promise in that election was to offer &quot;cocaine and whores to potential investors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://lawiscool.com/2007/09/19/sa-tan-sues-the-queen/ |title=Sa Tan sues The Queen – Law is Cool |website=Lawiscool.com |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
