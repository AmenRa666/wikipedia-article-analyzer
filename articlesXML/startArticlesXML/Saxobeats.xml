'''''Saxobeats''''' is the debut studio album by [[Romania]]n dance/pop vocalist [[Alexandra Stan]]. It was released first in France on August 29, 2011, while the releases in other countries followed later in 2011. Four singles were spawned from the album: &quot;[[Get Back (ASAP)]]&quot;, &quot;[[Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)]]&quot;, &quot;[[One Million (song)|1.000.000]]&quot; and the worldwide number-one hit &quot;[[Mr. Saxobeat]]&quot;. The album contains thirteen tracks (eight distinct song plus five remixes).&lt;ref name=&quot;mediaprosaxobeats&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediapromusic.ro/stiri/8790876-saxobeats-albumul-de-debut-al-alexandrei-stan|title=SAXOBEATS- albumul de debut al Alexandrei Stan|date=|publisher=MediaPro Music|language=Romanian|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks on the album tackle various genres like mainly [[Dance music|dance]], [[synthpop]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]]. The only collaboration is with German rapper [[Carlprit]] to the song &quot;One Million&quot;. The album was re-released in [[Japan]] on October 10, 2013 under the title &quot;[[Cliche (Hush Hush)]]&quot; as a reissue, with three new tracks and four new remixes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/jp/album/cliche-hush-hush-deluxe-edition/id720737614?l=en]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and development==
In 2011, Alexandra Stan received a recording track from a record label. In the past she has participated in various music-related contests with a notable appearance at the Mamaia Festival section interpretation, Romania's most known festival. Because of this, she was contacted and joined by Maan Studio, who consisted Marcel Prodan and Andrei Nemirschi. She had recorded her first single [[Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)]]. However, the single was no big success,charted only in Romania at No.18. The single was a massive radio hit in her native country in the late of 2009.

In an interview during a concert in the Czech Republic, Alexanda Stan announced that the album works and writing is finished. She also stated, that the album will hold only ten songs, which are already finished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqSZvE7gpPc Youtube | Alexandra Stan Interview in Czech Republic] www.youtube.com. Retrieved on August 01, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings and composition==
In an interview, Stan said that most of her songs are &quot;part of her life and they are telling a different story.&quot; She said &quot;The album will be very diversified and I’ll approach many genres.&quot;. Most of the songs on the album are related to Alexandra in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.directlyrics.com/kevipod-interviews-alexandra-stan-news.html&lt;/ref&gt; The album features various forms of [[electronic music]]; specifically [[house music|house]] [[eurodance]] and typical Romanian rhythms. The track [[1.000.000 (song)|1.000.000]] was released both through Alexandra's own website and through her label's YouTube channel. The track is a [[R&amp;B]]-inspired duet with [[Zimbabwe]]-born [[Germany|German]] rapper [[Carlprit]]. The [[nu-disco]] song &quot;Show Me The Way&quot;, a cover of the [[Show Me the Way (Peter Frampton song)|Peter Frampton hit]], was released on her record label's YouTube channel. Following on from these, Stan recorded her third single &quot;[[Get Back (ASAP)]]&quot; which was released as her third single from the album. The song touches on Eurodance, [[Europop]], [[pop music|pop]] and the [[electropop]] genres throughout. The song is known as Mr. Saxobeat 2 for the strong saxophone similars. It also didn`t have the success of her previous hit, still chart in Top 40. Two versions were released for the song, a &quot;Maan Extended Version&quot; and the newer studio version, which was the version chosen for the main single release.
In October 2013 Alexandra announced the re-release of Saxobeats in Japan under the new title ''[[Cliché (Hush Hush)]]'', before the scandal with her manager Marcel Prodan.
