'''The Charlatans''' (known in the United States as '''The Charlatans UK''') are an English indie rock [[musical ensemble|band]]. The band's line-up currently comprises lead vocalist [[Tim Burgess (musician)|Tim Burgess]], guitarist [[Mark Collins (musician)|Mark Collins]], bassist Martin Blunt and keyboardist Tony Rogers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author= Martin C. Strong| year= 2000| title= The Great Rock Discography| edition= 5th| publisher= Mojo Books| location= Edinburgh| pages= 165–166| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former members of the band include vocalist Baz Ketley (1989); guitarist Jon Day (Jonathan Baker) (1989–1991); keyboardist [[Rob Collins (musician)|Rob Collins]] (1989–1996), who died in a [[traffic collision|car accident]] during recording of their fifth album; and drummer Jon Brookes (1989-2013), who died after being diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2010.

In the UK, all of the band's twelve studio albums have charted in the Top 40 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], three of them being number ones. They have also achieved seventeen Top 30 singles and four Top 10 hits in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

==History==

===Formation (1988&amp;ndash;1989)===
The band were originally formed in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] by [[bass guitar|bassist]] Martin Blunt, who recruited fellow [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlanders]] [[Rob Collins (musician)|Rob Collins]] ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Jon Brookes ([[drum kit|drums]]), Jon Day (Jonathan Baker) ([[guitar]]) and singer/guitarist Baz Ketley (who later left the band to be replaced by [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]]).

Although the Charlatans would later become popularly associated with the [[Madchester]] scene, the band's early demos recorded in 1988 in [[Birmingham]] and [[Dudley]] already evidenced the sound that the band ultimately became famous for, dominated by Collins's [[Hammond organ]] but underpinned by the driving rhythm section of Blunt's powerful running bass and Brookes's drumming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robb|first=John|title=The Charlatans We Are Rock|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6EcrEIdLi_UC|accessdate=2013-06-23|year=2010|publisher=Random House|location=London|isbn=1409034399|page=18|chapter=First Rehearsals|chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6EcrEIdLi_UC&amp;pg=PT18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With their sound – fusing 1960s [[soul music|soul]], [[R&amp;B]] and [[garage rock]] – inherited from Blunt's earlier 1982 band Makin' Time, the band saw themselves firmly in the West Midlands tradition of hard-edged soul and R&amp;B that included Birmingham bands [[The Spencer Davis Group]] and early [[Dexys Midnight Runners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robb|first=John|title=The Charlatans We Are Rock|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6EcrEIdLi_UC|accessdate=2013-06-23|year=2010|publisher=Random House|location=London|isbn=1409034399|page=18|chapter=Shape up or ship out ... the band's sound comes together|chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6EcrEIdLi_UC&amp;pg=PT18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the name The Charlatans was already being used when the original members of the band were still located in the West Midlands, many sources state that they formed in [[Northwich]], [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helphiregroupjobs.co.uk/our_locations/northwich/working_and_living_in_northwich/|title=Helphire Group : Working and Living in Northwich |publisher=Helphiregroupjobs.co.uk |date= |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the band relocated to the home town of new lead singer [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] (who was born in Salford, but lived in Northwich from an early age) before the 1990 release of The Charlatans' debut [[single (music)|single]] &quot;Indian Rope&quot;, on the band's own Dead Dead Good Records [[record label|label]].  Thus based on the definition of hometown used by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' the band was formed in Northwich, and consequently Northwich is recorded as their home town in such publications as ''[[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]]'' - although the founding members are actually from Walsall.

===Early years (1990&amp;ndash;1993)===
[[File:Charlatans(UK).jpg|thumb|right|The Charlatans during their early days]]

The debut single &quot;Indian Rope&quot; proved to be an [[indie (music)|indie]] [[chart-topper|hit]] and the group soon found a major label in [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]] offshoot [[Situation Two]] in time for the release of &quot;[[The Only One I Know]]&quot;, which reached the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| page= 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further single &quot;Then&quot; and their debut [[album]] ''[[Some Friendly]]'' were released later that year. Around this time The Charlatans were forced to add ''UK'' to their name for an American tour due to competing claims by a 1960s rock band also known as [[The Charlatans (U.S. band)|The Charlatans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt;

Baker left the band after 1991's &quot;Over Rising&quot; single to be replaced by [[Mark Collins (musician)|Mark Collins]] (no relation to Rob). The band brought in [[record producer|producer]] [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] for their second album ''[[Between 10th and 11th]]'' (named after the address of the [[New York City|New York]] Marquee, the site of the group's first [[United States|US]] [[concert]]). Released in early 1992, the album failed to reach the [[Top 40|Top 20]] in the [[UK Albums Chart]],&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;  but the Top 20 success of lead single &quot;Weirdo&quot; and a double weekend of gigs ('Daytripper') in [[Blackpool]] and [[Brighton]] together with [[Ride (band)|Ride]] would keep them in the public eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukmix.org/articles/1999/charlatans.html |title=Ukmix.org |publisher=Ukmix.org |date= |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band suffered a major setback later that year, when Rob Collins was charged with armed robbery after a friend had robbed an [[Licensing laws of the United Kingdom#Off-licence|off licence]] while he was waiting in the car outside.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Collins claimed to have no foreknowledge of the robbery until he heard a gunshot inside the shop and his friend exited, although he later admitted that he should not have picked up his friend after he had realised what he had done. In court he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of &quot;assisting an offender after an offence&quot; and served four months in prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt;

===Mid-nineties fame (1994&amp;ndash;1997)===
Their third album ''[[Up To Our Hips]]'' (1994) reached number 8 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;

In 1995 the release of the band's [[The Charlatans (1995 album)|self-titled]] fourth album saw them become major UK stars again, topping the UK albums chart and spawning the Top 20 single &quot;Just When You're Thinkin' Things Over&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;

Keyboard player Rob Collins was killed in a [[traffic collision|car crash]] on 22 July 1996, during the recording of the band's fifth album ''[[Tellin' Stories]]''. The Charlatans decided to continue, drafting in the [[Primal Scream]] and former [[Felt (band)|Felt]] keyboardist [[Martin Duffy (musician)|Martin Duffy]] until a permanent replacement for Collins could be found, particularly for The Charlatans' support slot at [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]' [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] concerts in mid-1996. ''[[Tellin' Stories]]'' was released in 1997, featuring contributions from both Rob Collins and Duffy. The group had their biggest UK hits to date in the singles &quot;One to Another&quot;, &quot;North Country Boy&quot; and &quot;How High&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;

===Line-up and label changes (1997&amp;ndash;2004)===
After the release of the career-spanning compilation ''[[Melting Pot (The Charlatans album)|Melting Pot]]'' the band's contract with [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]] was up, and they signed to [[Universal Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Relations with the Beggars label remained strong however, and the band helped put together the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s collection ''[[Songs From The Other Side]]'' and the [[DVD]] ''[[Just Lookin' 1990 - 1997]]'', which showcased all their promotional videos and a selection of live recordings from that era.

''[[Us And Us Only]]'' was the start of a new era for The Charlatans. Their first release for Universal saw new keyboard player Tony Rogers make his Charlatans album debut,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; having previously toured in support of ''[[Tellin' Stories]]'' and contributing to B-sides &quot;Keep It to Yourself&quot; and &quot;Clean Up Kid&quot; from the &quot;How High&quot; single. The band took on a slightly [[country music|country]] sound, heavily influenced by Burgess's love of [[Bob Dylan]].

The [[soul music|soul]] influenced ''[[Wonderland (The Charlatans album)|Wonderland]]'' followed in 2001, before ''[[Up At The Lake]]'' was released in 2004.

===The Sanctuary years (2005&amp;ndash;2007)===
The band released their ninth full-length album on 10 April 2006, their first for new label [[Sanctuary Records]]. Titled ''[[Simpatico (The Charlatans album)|Simpatico]]'', the [[reggae]] and [[Dub music|dub]] tinged album was produced by Jim Lowe, and included fan favourite &quot;NYC (There's No Need to Stop)&quot; and first single &quot;[[Blackened Blue Eyes]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/charlatans/21941 |title=The Charlatans set to unleash new LP &amp;#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=12 January 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single charted at number 28, whilst the album reached the top 10 in its first week of release, before dropping out of the charts shortly after.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;

Their follow-up to ''Simpatico'' was the career-spanning singles compilation entitled ''[[Forever: The Singles]]'' which was released on [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] on 13 November 2006. It was preceded by the re-recorded song (remixed by [[Martin Glover|Youth]]) &quot;You're So Pretty We're So Pretty&quot;, which originally appeared on their 2001 album ''[[Wonderland (The Charlatans album)|Wonderland]].''

The band played a number of high-profile supporting gigs in mid-2007, including for [[The Who]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] at venues including [[Wembley Stadium]] and [[Twickenham Stadium]] in London, as well as the [[Bingley Music Live]] event, Nass Festival 2007 and at Delamere Forest in Cheshire. A recording of ''[[Live At Delamere Forest]]'' was released as a five-part download for a limited time via their official website.

===Cooking Vinyl, nostalgic performances and Brookes's illness (2008&amp;ndash;2012)===
The band contributed the song &quot;Blank Heart, Blank Mind&quot; to a ''Love Music, Hate Racism'' compilation CD which came free with the October 2007 issue of the ''[[NME]]''. Later the same month, the new single &quot;You Cross My Path&quot; was released as a free download exclusively through the [[XFM]] website. A second single &quot;Oh! Vanity&quot; emerged in March 2008, as The Charlatans teamed up with XFM once again, becoming the first UK band to release an album (their tenth studio album ''[[You Cross My Path (album)|You Cross My Path]]'') as a free download via a radio station. The album also received a physical CD/LP release on the [[Cooking Vinyl]] label on 19 May 2008, which coincided with a full UK tour.

Their eleventh studio album, ''[[Who We Touch]]'', was released on 6 September 2010 on Cooking Vinyl Records, and included the single &quot;Love Is Ending&quot;. The album charted at No.&amp;nbsp;21 in the UK Albums Chart. 2010 also saw the twentieth anniversary of the band's debut album ''Some Friendly'', which they played live at [[Primavera Sound Festival]] 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OlasKoolKitchenOnRadio23CharlatansLiveSetPrimavera2010 |title=Ola's Kool Kitchen on Radio23 Charlatans live set Primavera 2010 : DJ Ola : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2010, drummer Jon Brookes collapsed during a performance in [[Philadelphia]]. The remaining US tour dates were postponed, as Brookes was diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10675771 |title=Nzherald.co.nz |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date= 24 September 2010|accessdate=30 August 2011 |first=Jonathan |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was flown back to the UK for an operation and course of radiation and chemotherapy treatment. [[The Verve]]'s [[Peter Salisbury]] acted as a stand-in drummer for the remainder of the Charlatans UK dates. Brookes returned to the stage for the band's Christmas and New Year Eve's gigs in 2010.

On 28 March 2011 Universal Music re-released a deluxe edition of the band's 1999 album ''Us &amp; Us Only'', featuring a collection of bonus tracks including B-sides, live recordings, radio sessions and rare remixes. In March and April 2011 Tim Burgess and Mark Collins played an acoustic tour of the UK, to coincide with which they released an EP ''Warm Sounds'', which featured six stripped-down and reworked versions of Charlatans tracks including &quot;North Country Boy&quot;, &quot;The Only One I Know&quot; and &quot;Smash The System&quot;. In December 2011 the band announced they would be performing ''Tellin' Stories'' in its entirety at London's HMV [[Hammersmith Apollo]], [[O2 Apollo Manchester]] and Glasgow's [[Barrowland Ballroom]] in June 2012.

===Death of Jon Brookes and new album (2013&amp;ndash;present)===
2013 saw the band return to their Big Mushroom studio to begin working on demos for a new album. In May 2013 the ''Mountain Picnic Blues'' DVD was released, a documentary about their ''Tellin' Stories'' album from its creation in 1997 to the 15th anniversary of the album.

On 13 August 2013 the band's drummer Jon Brookes succumbed to brain cancer at the age of 44, having undergone several operations and treatment for the condition since his diagnosis in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23682282 |title=BBC News - Charlatans drummer Jon Brookes dies age 44 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band themselves paid him tribute in a special event, with [[Peter Salisbury|Pete Salisbury]] playing in his place and bands such as [[Beady Eye]], [[The Vaccines]] and [[Manic Street Preachers]] also joining the bill. Proceeds from the night went to The Brain Tumour Charity, of which The Charlatans are now patrons; the charity have set up The Jon Brookes Fund as a lasting tribute to the drummer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/beady-eye/73315 |title=Beady Eye, The Vaccines and The Charlatans perform at Jon Brookes tribute concert &amp;#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2013-10-19 |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Burgess confirmed that Brookes's recordings would appear on the band's next album, originally slated for sometime in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-charlatans/74065 |title=Late Charlatans drummer Jon Brookes to appear on band's new album &amp;#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charlatans announced details of their twelfth studio album ''[[Modern Nature]]'', to be released on the 26th January 2015 on their new label [[BMG Rights Management]]. Featuring eleven new tracks (including the recent limited edition 7” ''Talking In Tones''), ''Modern Nature'' was produced by The Charlatans and [[Jim Spencer]], and mixed by [[Craig Silvey]]. The album features contributions from the band’s temporary drummers [[Peter Salisbury]] (of [[The Verve]]), [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] (of [[New Order (band)|New Order]]) and Gabriel Gurnsey (of [[Factory Floor]]), as well as producer Dave Tollan, backing singers Melanie Marshall and Sandra Marvin, strings by [[Sean O'Hagan]] and brass courtesy of Jim Paterson from [[Dexys Midnight Runners]].
