The '''''Annual Bulletin''''' of the '''Comparative Law Bureau&lt;!--redirect--&gt;''' of the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) was a [[United States|U.S.]] specialty [[law journal]] (1908–1914, 1933). The first [[comparative law]] journal in the United States,&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; it surveyed foreign legislation and legal literature. Circulated to all ABA members, it was absorbed in 1915 by the newly formed ''[[American Bar Association Journal]]''.

==History==
===Bureau===
In 1905, a committee of the [[Pennsylvania]] State Bar Association considered the creation of a [[comparative law]] society and recommended to bring such large project to the [[American Bar Association]].&lt;ref name=Clark2005&gt;Clark 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA created such entity at its 1907 annual meeting, as a new section named the Comparative Law Bureau: the Bureau members would meet annually at the ABA's summer meeting and publish an annual bulletin.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The Bureau's officers included: [[Simeon E. Baldwin]] (as director, 1907–1919; ABA co-founder and president, later Governor of Connecticut) and William Smithers (as secretary, also the chairman of the ''Bulletin'''s editorial staff).&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; The Bureau's managers included: [[James Barr Ames]] (dean at Harvard), [[George Kirchwey]] (dean at Columbia), [[William Draper Lewis]]  (dean at Pennsylvania, later the founding director of the [[American Law Institute]]), and [[John Henry Wigmore]] (dean at Northwestern).&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The Bureau's aims were presented in the ''Bulletin'''s first issue: (1) to publish an annual ''Bulletin'' with foreign legislation and reviews of foreign legal literature; (2) to translate and publish foreign legislation as well as relevant expert opinions; (3) to hold an annual conference for discussing comparative law; (4) to improve means by which foreign laws can become available to U.S. lawyers; (5) to promote research in the areas of foreign law; (6) to establish a list of foreign correspondents; and (7) to gather information on foreign law, such as bibliographies, for the benefit of practicing lawyers, law teachers, and students.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The Bureau met annually and published its ''Bulletin'' (separately, then within the ''Journal'') until financial difficulties in the 1930s due to the [[Great Depression]]. In 1933, after publishing an ultimate separate ''Bulletin'', the Bureau was merged with the ABA's International Law section, forming the ABA Section of International &amp; Comparative Law.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

===Bulletin===
In July 1908, the ''Annual Bulletin'' (no [[ISSN]])&lt;ref&gt;The ''Bulletin'' is referenced under various titles. The main uniform title used in library catalogs (Library of Congress, OCLC/WorldCat) is &quot;Annual &lt;!--here lowercase b--&gt;bulletin (American Bar Association. Comparative Law Bureau)&quot;. Other titles found in citations include: &quot;Annual Bulletin - Comparative Law Bureau&quot;, &quot;Annual Bulletin of the Comparative Law Bureau&quot;, &quot;Annual Bulletin of the Comparative Law Bureau of the American Bar Association&quot;, etc., and sometimes &quot;Bulletin of the Comparative Law Bureau of the American Bar Association&quot;, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by the Bureau. The first [[comparative law]] journal in the United States,&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; it provided a survey of foreign legislation and legal literature. Its first issue was a 200 or so page bulletin.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The editor (chairman of the editorial staff) was Bureau secretary Smithers (from Philadelphia, where was also the ''Bulletin'''s printer).&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; The editorial staff in 1908 included: [[Simeon E. Baldwin]] (Yale) for general [[jurisprudence]]; Ernest Lorenzen (George Washington) and [[Roscoe Pound]] (then at Northwestern) for [[Germany]]; Charles Wetherill for [[Great Britain]]; Masuji Miyakawa for [[Japan]]; Leo Rowe (University of Pennsylvania) for [[Latin America]]; William Hastings (University of Nebraska, dean in 1910) for [[Russia]]; Samuel Scott for [[Spain]]; and Gordon Sherman for [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; There were foreign correspondents from fourteen countries, including Gaston de Leval from [[Belgium]] and [[Eugen Huber]] (creator of the [[Swiss civil code of 1907]], still in force) from [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;

The ''Bulletin'' was circulated to all ABA members and to other subscribers.&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; Published by International Printing Co. (Philadelphia, PA), it ran from July 1, 1908 to July 1, 1914,&lt;ref name=LOC-AnnualBulletin&gt;LOC, &quot;Annual bulletin&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; for volume 1 to 7.

The separate ''Bulletin'' was discontinued for two reasons:&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; in 1914, [[World War I]] disrupted cross-Atlantic connections; and in 1915, the ABA started publishing its own ''Journal'', into which the ''Bulletin'' was merged as an annual issue. (Though in 1933,&lt;ref name=LOC-Bulletin1933&gt;LOC, &quot;Bulletin for 1933&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; there was an ultimate separate ''Bulletin'', 215 page long. And in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;[[WorldCat]]. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22590456?tab=details &quot;Annual bulletin&quot; (1964 reprint), OCLC 22590456].&lt;/ref&gt; two backissues were reprinted.)

===Journal===
{{Main|American Bar Association Journal}}
&lt;!-- (Only a paragraph summary of the main article.) --&gt;In 1915, the ''American Bar Association Journal'' ({{ISSN|0002-7596}}) was founded by the [[American Bar Association]] as a quarterly magazine (it became monthly in 1921). From 1915 to 1928, the ''Bulletin'' was merged into it:&lt;ref name=LOC-Bulletin1933/&gt;&lt;ref name=LOC-AnnualBulletin/&gt; the Comparative Law Bureau controlled the second issue each year,&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt; the April number. Bureau issues stopped in 1929, but comparative and foreign law articles still regularly appeared in the ''Journal'' (about five to ten per volume).&lt;ref name=Clark2005/&gt;
