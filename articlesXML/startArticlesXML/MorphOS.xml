'''MorphOS''' is an [[AmigaOS]]-like computer [[operating system]]. It is a mixed [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[open source]] OS produced for the [[Pegasos]] [[PowerPC]] processor based computer, PowerUP accelerator equipped Amiga computers, and a series of [[Freescale]] development boards that use the [[Genesi]] firmware, including the [[EFIKA]] and [[mobileGT]]. Since MorphOS 2.4, [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Mac Mini]] G4 is supported as well, and with the release of MorphOS 2.5 and MorphOS 2.6 the eMac and PowerMac G4 models are respectively supported. The release of MorphOS 3.2 added limited support for PowerMac G5. The core, based on the [[Quark (kernel)|Quark]] [[microkernel]], is proprietary, although several libraries and other parts are open source, such as [[Ambient desktop|Ambient]] [[Desktop environment|desktop]].

==Characteristics and versions==
Developed for PowerPC [[Central processing unit|processor]]s from Freescale and [[IBM]] while supporting the original [[AmigaOS]] [[68k|MC680x0]] applications via proprietary task-based emulation, and most AmigaOS/PPC applications via API wrappers. It is [[Application programming interface|API]] compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 and has a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] based on [[Magic User Interface|MUI]].

Besides the Pegasos version of MorphOS, there is a version for Amiga computers equipped with [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] accelerator cards produced by [[Phase5]]. This version is free, although it does slow down after each two-hour session if it has not been registered. Registration is free. PowerUP MorphOS was most recently updated on 23 February 2006; however, it does not exceed the feature set or advancement of the Pegasos release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amiga.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=6671 | title=Announcements : Updated MorphOS for PowerUP Users | author=Piru | date=February 23, 2006 | work=Amiga.org | accessdate=2007-03-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070314010244/http://www.amiga.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=6671 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=11668 | title=MorphOS 1.4.5 Released for Classic Amiga | author=Thom Holwerda | date=August 24, 2005 | work=OSNews | accessdate=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of MorphOS for the [[EFIKA]], a very small mainboard based on the ultra-low wattage [[PowerPC 5000#MPC52xx|MPC5200B]] processor from Freescale, has been shown at exhibitions and user-gatherings in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=16209 | title=MorphOS 1.5 Running on EFIKA to Be Shown | author=Thom Holwerda | date=October 17, 2006 | work=OSNews | accessdate=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current (since 2.0) release of MorphOS supports the EFIKA.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Lmm c.gif|thumb|left|Early MorphOS version on promotional &quot;video microwave&quot;]] --&gt;
[[Image:AmigaOS 3 and clones.svg|right|thumb|200px|Amiga family development tree]]

The project started in 1999, based on the [[Quark (kernel)|Quark]] [[microkernel]]. The earliest versions of MorphOS ran only via PPC accelerator cards on the Amiga computers, and required portions of [[AmigaOS]] to fully function. A collaborative effort between the companies bPlan (of which the lead MorphOS developer is a partner) and Thendic-France in 2002 resulted in the first regular, non-prototype production of bPlan-engineered Pegasos computers capable of running MorphOS or Linux. A busy promotional year followed in 2003, with appearances at conventions and exhibitions in several places around the world, including [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] in Las Vegas. Thendic-France had financial problems and folded; however, the collaboration continued under the new banner of &quot;[[Genesi]]&quot;.

After some bitter disagreements within the MorphOS development team in 2003 and 2004, culminating with accusations by a MorphOS developer that he and others had not been paid, the [[Ambient desktop]] interface was released under [[GPL]] and is now actively developed by the Ambient development team. Subject to GPL rules, Ambient continues to be included in the commercial MorphOS product. An alternative MorphOS desktop system is ''Scalos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scalos.noname.fr | title=Scalos - The Amiga Desktop Replacement | author=Chris Haynes | date=March 21, 2007 | accessdate=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2008, the MorphOS team announced that MorphOS 2.0 would be released within Q2/2008. This promise was only kept by a few seconds, with the release of MorphOS 2.0 occurring on June 30, 2008 23:59 CET. MorphOS 2 is commercially available at a price of 150 EUR per machine (111.11 EUR as a special promotion within the first two weeks of its release). A fully functional demo of MorphOS is available, but without a keyfile, its speed is decreased significantly after 30 minutes of use.

MorphOS 2 includes a native [[TCP/IP]] stack (&quot;Netstack&quot;) and a web browser, Sputnik or [[Origyn Web Browser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amigamccc.org/journal/0809eric.htm | title=MorphOS 2.0 | accessdate=2010-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sputnik was begun under a user community bounty system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.morphzone.org/modules/bounty/ | title=Morph Bounties | work=MorphZone | accessdate=2007-03-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070306150915/http://www.morphzone.org/modules/bounty/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; that also resulted in MOSNet, a free, separate TCP/IP stack for MorphOS 1 users.
