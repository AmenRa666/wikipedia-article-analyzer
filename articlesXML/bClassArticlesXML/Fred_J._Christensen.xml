==Biography==

===Pre-war===
Christensen was born of [[Norway|Norwegian]] immigrant parents Frederik and Ruth Christensen in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], on October 17, 1921. His father worked as a [[machinist]] for [[Harvard University]]. Prior to World War II, he attended [[Boston University College of Fine Arts#School of Music|Boston University School of Music]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

===World War II===
In 1942, Christensen joined the United States Army Air Forces as an aviation cadet and was commissioned in December 1942. After [[fighter aircraft|pursuit]] training, 2nd Lt. Christensen went to the [[Eighth Air Force]] in England in July 1943. Completing an operational training unit course at [[RAF Atcham#495th Fighter Training Group|RAF Atcham]] to familiarize himself with the [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighter, he joined the [[56th Fighter Group]], based at [[RAF Halesworth]], as a replacement pilot on August 26, 1943.

Christensen was assigned to the [[62d Fighter Squadron]]. He was credited with his first German aircraft shot down on November 26, 1943, a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] near [[Papenburg]], Germany. He was recognized as an ace on February 11, 1944, with the crediting of his fifth kill, a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]]. He continued to regularly shoot down German aircraft, scoring two kills on the first day of [[Big Week]], another on a long-range bomber escort to Berlin on March 6, and four more in consecutive missions of March 15 and 16.

Promoted to [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in February and [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] in April, Christensen shot down his 16th aircraft on July 5, and also that day incurred the first battle damage of his tour.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[United Press|UPI]] correspondent [[Walter Cronkite]] following July 7 mission&lt;/ref&gt; On July 7, leading the 62nd FS, Christensen was returning from a bomber escort mission and overflew [[Gardelegen]] Airfield, assessing it as a possible strafing target. Christensen noted numerous parked aircraft dispersed on the field, but then observed a flight of [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports in trail at very low altitude, approaching to land.

Christensen dove on the landing pattern from {{convert|10000|ft|m}} and shot down the next-to-last transport with hits on the left side. He quickly overtook and fired at a second target, which burned and crashed. A third transport attempted to evade to the left, but he downed it with a [[Deflection (military)|deflection]] burst, setting its fuel tanks on fire. The German pilot attempted to land, but crashed short of the field.

As Christensen maneuvered for a fourth interception, his engine quit from fuel starvation. Christensen switched tanks, air-started his engine, and barely {{convert|100|ft|m}} off the ground, fixed another Ju 52 in his sights. He scored several hits, and in its attempt to evade, the transport flew into the ground. Christensen attacked a fifth airplane, observing strikes on its fuselage and wing root, and shot it down before it could land. He then destroyed a sixth Ju 52 to become an &quot;[[ace in a day]]&quot; in an engagement that had lasted less than two minutes. In all, 10 of the 12 transports were shot down by the 62nd FS.

Christensen flew 107 combat sorties with the 56th Fighter Group and used five different aircraft to record his victories, including two assigned as his personal aircraft:
*P-47D-10-RE 42-75207 LM: C, named ''&quot;Boche Buster&quot;'' on the nose cowling and ''Rozzie Geth'' near the cockpit, and
*P-47D-25-RE 42-26628 LM: C, named ''Miss Fire'' and ''Rozzie Geth II''.&lt;ref name=&quot;rozzie&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = |url = http://www.stephenmudgett.com/products.html|title = World War II USAAC 8th and 9th Air Force|work = |publisher = Stephen Mudgett Aviation Art|accessdate = March 17, 2007}} Representations of both aircraft can be viewed here.&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;Rozzie Geth&quot; was a diminutive of the name of a college girlfriend, Rosamand Gethro.)&lt;ref&gt;

Christensen's 21.5 officially credited kills rank him 12th among all Army Air Forces aces, 7th among aces of the Eighth Air Force, and 5th among P-47 aces.&lt;ref name=&quot;kills&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = |url = http://afhra.maxwell.af.mil/numbered_studies/1039707.pdf |title = USAF Historical Study 85: USAF Credits for Destruction of Enemy Aircraft, World War II|format = |work = |publisher = Office of Air Force History, AFHRA|accessdate = October 14, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060522085334/http://afhra.maxwell.af.mil/numbered_studies/1039707.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 22, 2006}} p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, ''The Mighty Eighth'', 272-275&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sinbad====
While in England, Christensen adopted a stray [[black cat]] and named it [[Sinbad]]. He is reputed to have taken Sinbad with him on missions, carrying him in the cockpit of his P-47 as both a [[good luck charm]] and inspiration to his fellow pilots, then bringing the cat to the United States as a pet in September 1944 after the end of his tour. A family anecdote held that a [[war correspondent]] covering the 56th FG tried to photograph the cat, which kept jumping all over packed [[parachute]]s. All of the pilots using the gear returned safely, contributing to his legend.&lt;ref&gt;Both obituaries tell the story of Sinbad, quoting his daughter, including mention of the wartime press interview.&lt;/ref&gt;
