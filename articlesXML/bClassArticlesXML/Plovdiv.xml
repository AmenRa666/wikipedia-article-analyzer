'''Plovdiv''' ({{lang-bg|Пловдив}}, {{IPA-bg|pɫovˈdif|pron}}) is the [[List of largest cities and second largest cities by country|second-largest city]] in [[Bulgaria]] with a population of 341,567 inhabitants {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, while 544,628 live in its urban area. It is an important economic, transport, cultural, and educational center.

Plovdiv has evidence of habitation since the 6th millennium BC when the first [[Neolithic]] settlements were established. The area is continuously inhabited since 4000 BC{{dubious|date=October 2016}} and it is said to be one of the oldest cities in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeologists Explore Ancient Roman Forum of Philippopolis|url=http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/03012014/article/archaeologists-explore-ancient-roman-forum-of-philippopolis|website=Popular Archaeology|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;filipopol&quot;&gt;„Philippopolis Album“, Kesyakova Elena, Raytchev Dimitar, Hermes, Sofia, 2012, ISBN 978-954-26-1117-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;plovdiv1&quot;/&gt; Plovdiv was known in the West for most of its [[recorded history]] by the name ''[[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]]'' ({{lang-el|Φιλιππούπολη}}; {{lang-tr|Filibe}}; &quot;Philip's Town&quot;) as [[Philip II of Macedon]] conquered it in the 4th century BC and gave his name to it.  The city was originally a [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement,&lt;ref name=&quot;plovdiv1&quot;/&gt; later being invaded by [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe|Celts]], [[Romans]], [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]], [[Kievan Rus'|Slav]]-[[Varangians|Vikings]], [[Latin Empire|Crusaders]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. On 4 January 1878, Plovdiv was liberated from Ottoman rule by the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] army. It remained within the borders of Bulgaria until July of the same year, when it became the capital of the autonomous Ottoman region of [[Eastern Rumelia]]. In 1885, Plovdiv and Eastern Rumelia joined Bulgaria.

Plovdiv is situated in a fertile region of south-central Bulgaria on the two banks of the [[Maritsa River]]. The city has historically developed on seven [[syenite]] hills, some of which are {{convert|250|m|abbr=off}} high. Because of these hills, Plovdiv is often referred to in Bulgaria as &quot;The City of the Seven Hills&quot;.

Plovdiv is host to cultural events such as the [[International Fair Plovdiv]], the international theatrical [[festival]] &quot;A stage on a crossroad&quot;, and the TV festival &quot;The golden chest&quot;. There are many remains preserved from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] such as the ancient [[Plovdiv Roman theatre]], Roman [[odeon (building)|odeon]], [[Roman aqueduct]], [[Plovdiv Roman Stadium|Roman Stadium]], the archaeological complex Eirene, and others.

The oldest American educational institution outside the [[United States]] was founded in Plovdiv in 1860, which was later moved to Sofia – today's [[American College of Sofia]].

On 5 September 2014, Plovdiv was selected as the Bulgarian host of the [[European Capital of Culture]] 2019.&lt;ref name=culturecapital/&gt; This happened with the help of the [http://plovdiv2019.eu/en/ Municipal Foundation “Plovdiv 2019″] - a non-government organization which was established in 2011 by Plovdiv’s City Council. The main objectives were to develop and to prepare Plovdiv’s bid book for European Capital of Culture in 2019. The organization has a board of directors, which consists of 9 members and an Executive Director. The foundation also has a Public Council, chaired by the mayor of the city, and a Control Board supervises the organization’s activities. The main objective of the foundation is strategic development and implementation of the bid book.

Plovdiv is on the banks of the [[Maritsa]] river, southeast of the Bulgarian capital, [[Sofia]]. The city is in the southern part of the Plain of Plovdiv, an [[alluvial plain]] forming the western portion of the [[Upper Thracian Plain]]. The heights of [[Sredna Gora]] rise to the northwest, to the east are the Chirpan Heights, and the [[Rhodope mountains]] surround the plain from the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Пътеводител България |publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа ИК |location=София |page=145 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-9942-32-5 |year=2002 |author=avtori Evgeni Dinchev ...|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city had originally developed to the south of Maritsa, and expanded across the river only within the last 100 years. Modern Plovdiv covers an area of {{convert|101|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, which is less than 0.1% of Bulgaria's total area. This makes Plovdiv the most densely populated city in the country with 3,769 inhabitants per km².

Inside the city proper are six syenite hills,. In the beginning of the 20th century, there used to be seven of them, but one ([[Markovo tepe]]) was destroyed. Three of them are called the Three Hills ({{lang-bg|Трихълмие}} ''Trihalmie''), the others are called the Hill of the Youth ({{lang-bg|Младежки хълм}}, ''Mladezhki halm''), the Hill of the Liberators ({{lang-bg|Хълм на освободителите}}, ''Halm na osvoboditelite'') and the Hill of [[Hristo G. Danov|Danov]] ({{lang-bg|Данов хълм}}, ''Danov halm'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milarodino.com/bg/13_centuries/city/plovdiv/ |title=Седемте чудеса на България – Пловдив |publisher=Milarodino.com |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today only a small part of the ancient city has been excavated.&lt;ref name=pldiv&gt;[http://www.plovdivcity.net/bg/plovdiv_history.html PlovdivCity.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412054326/http://www.plovdivcity.net/bg/plovdiv_history.html |date=12 April 2008 }}, посетен на 10 ноември 2007 г.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 250 AD the whole city was [[Battle of Philippopolis (250)|burned down]] by the [[Goths]], led by their ruler [[Cniva]], and many of its citizens, according to [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] numbering 100,000, died or were taken captive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Елена Кесякова | author2 = Александър Пижев |author3 = Стефан Шивачев |author4 = Недялка Петрова | year = 1999 | title = Книга за Пловдив | publisher = Издателство „Полиграф“ | location = Пловдив | isbn = 954-9529-27-4 | language = bg | pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took a century and hard work to recover the city.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Monument of Khan Krum in Plovdiv.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Monument of [[Krum of Bulgaria|Krum]] in Plovdiv, who was the first Bulgarian ruler to capture Plovdiv.]]
[[Slavic peoples|The Slavs]] had fully settled in the area by the middle of the 6th century, peacefully as there are no any records for their attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dimitrov |first=B. |title=The Bulgarians – the first Europeans |publisher=University press &quot;St Climent of Ohrid&quot; |location=Sofia |page=25 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-07-1757-4 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the establishment of [[Bulgaria]] in 681 Philippoupolis, the name of the city then, became an important border fortress of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It was captured by Khan [[Krum of Bulgaria|Krum]] in 812 but the region was fully incorporated into the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in 834 during the reign of Khan [[Malamir of Bulgaria|Malamir]].&lt;ref&gt;Аndreev, J. ''The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars'' (''Balgarskite hanove i tsare'', ''Българските ханове и царе''), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 66 ISBN 954-427-216-X.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reconquered by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 855–856 for a short time until it was returned to [[Boris I of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Gjuzelev, p. 130 (Gjuzelev, V., (1988) Medieval Bulgaria, Byzantine Empire, Black Sea, Venice, Genoa (Centre Culturel du Monde Byzantin).

The city possibly remained in Bulgarian hands until 970.&lt;ref&gt;Делев, &quot;Българската държава и общество при управлението на цар Петър&quot;, ''История и цивилизация за 11. клас'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the city is described at the time of [[Constantine VII]] in the 10th century as being within the Byzantine province ([[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]]). The historian John Fine describes Philippopolis as being a Byzantine possession at the time it was sacked by the ruler of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] in 969 who impaled 20,000 citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, pp. 160–161, 186: John V.A. Fine Jr., The Early Medieval Balkans, Ann Arbor, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Before and after the Rus' massacre, the city was settled by [[Paulician]] heretics transported from Syria and Armenia to serve as military settlers on the European frontier with Bulgaria. Aime de Varennes in 1180 encountered the singing of Byzantine songs in the city that recounted the deeds of Alexander the Great and his predecessors, over 1300 years before.&lt;ref&gt;Vacalopoulos, Apostolos E. ''Origins of the Greek Nation''. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: [[Rutgers University Press]], 1970) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Byzantine rule was interrupted by the [[Third crusade]](1189-1192) when the army of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] conquered Philippopolis. [[Ivanko of Bulgaria|Ivanko]] was appointed as the governor of the Byzantine Theme of Philippopolis in 1196, but between 1198 and 1200 separated it from Byzantium in a union with Bulgaria. The [[Latin Empire]] conquered Philippoupolis in 1204, and there were two short interregnum periods as the city was twice occupied by [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] before his death in 1207.&lt;ref name=pldv&gt;[http://www.focus-news.net/?id=n819663 Агенция Фокус – Цар Калоян получава корона, скиптър и знаме от кардинал Лъв]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, посетен на 17 ноември 2007 г.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1208 Kaloyan's successor [[Boril of Bulgaria|Boril]] was defeated by the Latins in the [[Battle of Philippopolis (1208)|Battle of Philippopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Аndreev, J.

[[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] conquered the duchy finally in 1230 but the city had possibly been earlier conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John v.a. |last=Fine |title=The Late Medieval Balkans |isbn=978-0-472-08260-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hh0Bu8C66TsC |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards Plovdiv was conquered by Byzantium, according to some information, by 1300 Plovdiv was a possession of [[Theodore Svetoslav]] of Bulgaria. It was conquered from Byzantium by [[George II of Bulgaria|George Terter II]] of Bulgaria in 1322.&lt;ref&gt;Аndreev, J.

In 1344 the city and eight other cities were surrendered to Bulgaria by the regency for [[John V Palaiologos]] as the price for [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]]'s support in the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–47]].&lt;ref&gt;Аndreev, J.

===Ottoman Rule===
In 1364, the [[Ottoman Turks]] under [[Lala Shahin Pasha]] seized Plovdiv.&lt;ref&gt;Аndreev, J. ''The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars'' (''Balgarskite hanove i tsare'', ''Българските ханове и царе''), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 274 ISBN 954-427-216-X.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pat&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Пътеводител България |publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа ИК |location=София |page=139 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-9942-32-5 |year=2002 |author=avtori Evgeni Dinchev ...|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to other data, Plovdiv was not Ottoman until the [[Battle of Maritsa]] in 1371 following which the citizens and the Bulgarian army fled leaving the city without resistance. Refugees settled in [[Asenovgrad|Stanimaka]]. During the [[Ottoman Interregnum]], in 1410 [[Musa Çelebi]] conquered the city killing and displacing inhabitants. The city was the centre of the [[Rumelia Eyalet]] between 1364–1443, a sanjak centre of it between 1443-1593, the sanjak centre in [[Silistra Eyalet]] between 1593-1826, the sanjak centre in [[Eyalet of Adrianople]] between 1826-1867 and the sanjak centre of [[Edirne Vilayet]] between 1867–1878. During that period Plovdiv was a major economic center along with [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Edirne]] and [[Thessaloniki]]. The richer citizens constructed beautiful houses many of which can still be seen in the Architectural reserve Old Plovdiv.

====National revival====

[[File:St. Bogoroditza plovdiv.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Church of the Holy Mother of God, Plovdiv|Virgin Mary Church]].]]
Under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Filibe, the name of the city then, was a focal point for the Bulgarian national movement and survived as one of the major cultural centers for Bulgarian culture and tradition.

Filibe was described as consisting of Turks, Bulgarians, Hellelnized Bulgarians, Armenians, Jews, Vlachs, Arvanites, Greeks and Roma people. In the 16-17 century a significant number of [[Sephardic Jews]] settled along with a smaller Armenian community from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The [[Paulician]]s adopted Catholicism or lost their identity. With the abolishment of [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] as the language of the [[Archbishop of Ohrid|Bulgarian Church]] and the complete abolition of the church in 1767, the introduction of the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet System]], a doctrine of ethnic division by religion, Christian and Muslim Bulgarians were subjected to [[Hellenization]] and  [[Turkification]] respectively. A major part of it was fully or partly Hellenized and was of Greek identity more in the sense of “[[Byzantine Greeks|Romei]] than [[Ellines]], in a cultural rather than an ethnic sense, the &quot;Langeris&quot; are also described as Greeks from the area of the nearby [[Asenovgrad|Stenimachos]]. This process of Hellenization flourished up until the 1830s and declined with the [[Tanzimat]], the idea of the [[Kingdom of Greece|Hellenic nation]] instead of the [[Rum millet|Romeic millet]] as Hellenes meant pagans to the Christians and finally with the re-establishment of the Bulgarian Church in 1870. According to records of the households and owners/renters in the central part of Plovdiv in the middle 19th century provided by Bulgarian and Greek chroniclers Genchev and Lyberatos, of a total of 358/421 the Bulgarians were either 141 or 118 and constituted 39.4% or 33.7%, the Gudilas were 94 or 141 constituting 26.3% or 38.1%, while the Langeris were 36-39 and between 10.1% and 10.5%, while according to the Bulgarian author the Bulgarian parents with children Gulidas were another 41 (11.4%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://balkanologie.revues.org/2342 Graecomans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219171700/http://balkanologie.revues.org/2342 |date=19 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Detrez&gt;{{cite book|last=Detrez|first=Raymon|title=Relations between Greeks and Bulgarians: The Gudilas of Plovid|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, England|isbn=978-0-7546-0998-8|page=34,36|url=https://books.google.bg/books?hl=bg&amp;id=s1VpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=langeris+plovdiv&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=stanimaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, although there is a little doubt about the Bulgarian origin of the Gulidas, the city could be considered of Greek or Bulgarian majority in the 19th century, on whether the Gudilas were considered part of the one or the other community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Detrez|first=Raymon|title=Relations between Greeks and Bulgarians: The Gudilas of Plovid|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, England|isbn=978-0-7546-0998-8|page=34|url=https://books.google.bg/books?hl=bg&amp;id=s1VpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=langeris+plovdiv&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=stanimaka|quote=deciding whether Plovdiv had a Bulgarian or a Greek majority depends on whether the gudilas are considered as Bulgarians or Greeks}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the statistics by the Bulgarian and Greek authors there is no Turks in the city, according to an alternative estimate the city was of Turkish majority then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=ed. by Ralf|last2=Beachy|first2=Robert|title=Who ran the cities? : city elites and urban power structures in Europe and North America, 1750-1940|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot [u.a.]|isbn=9780754651536|pages=189–190|url=https://books.google.bg/books?id=UQzGUZasbQkC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=plovdiv+muslim+majority&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQmo_ykYjNAhWI8RQKHVKYBr0Q6AEILzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=plovdiv%20muslim%20majority&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filibe had an important role in the struggle for Church independence which was according to some historians a peaceful bourgeois revolution. Filibe became the center of that struggle with leaders such as [[Nayden Gerov]], Dr Valkovich, [[Joakim Gruev]] and whole families. In 1836 the first Bulgarian school was inaugurated and in 1850 modern secular education began when the &quot;St Cyrill and Metodius&quot; school was opened. On 11 May 1858 the day of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] was celebrated for the first time, this later became a National holiday which is still celebrated today (but on the 24th May due to Bulgaria's 1916 transition from the [[Old Style]] (i.e. [[Julian calendar|Julian]]) to the [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] calendar, i.e. the [[Gregorian calendar]]). In 1858 in the [[Church of the Holy Mother of God, Plovdiv|Church of Virgin Mary]] the Christmas liturgy was served for the first time in the [[Bulgarian language]] since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation. Until 1906 there were Bulgarian and Greek bishops in the city. In 1868 the school expanded into the first grammar school. Some of the intellectuals, politicians and spiritual leaders of the nation graduated that school.&lt;ref name=&quot;pld&quot;/&gt;

The city was conquered by the Russians under [[Aleksandr Burago]] for several hours during the [[Battle of Philippopolis (1878)|Battle of Philippopolis]] on January 17, 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;pat&quot;/&gt; It was the capital of the [[Provisional Russian Administration in Bulgaria]] between May and October. According to the Russian census of the same year Filibe had a population of 24,000 citizens, of which ethnic [[Bulgarians]] comprised 45.4%, [[Turkish people|Turks]] - 23.1% and [[Greeks]] - 19.9%.

===Eastern Rumelia===

According to the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on 3 March 1878 the Principality of Bulgaria included the lands with predominantly Bulgarian population. Plovdiv which was the biggest and most vibrant Bulgarian city was selected as a capital of the restored country and for a seat of the Temporary Russian Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ocertsi&quot;&gt;Очерци из историята на Пловдив (стр. 80 – Космополитен град. Махали и квартали в ново време)&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain and [[Austria-Hungary]], however, did not approve that treaty and the final result of the war was concluded in the [[Congress of Berlin]] which divided the newly liberated country into several parts. It separated the autonomous region of [[Eastern Rumelia]] from Bulgaria and Plovdiv became its capital. The Ottoman Empire created a constitution and appointed a governor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.bg/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7915&amp;Itemid=367 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, History and Geography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306054931/http://www.mfa.bg/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7915&amp;Itemid=367 |date=6 March 2012 }} [http://www.webcitation.org/5FHCwODd7 Archived copy] at [[WebCite]] (20 April 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1885 [[Zahari Stoyanov]] formed the Secret Bulgarian Central Revolutionary Committee in the city which actively conducted propaganda for the unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. On 5 September several hundred armed rebels from Golyamo Konare (now [[Saedinenie, Plovdiv Province|Saedinenie]]) marched to Plovdiv. In the night of 5–6 September these men led by Danail Nikolaev took control of the city and removed from office the General-Governor [[Gavril Krastevich]]. A provisional government was formed led by [[Georgi Stranski]] and universal mobilization was announced.&lt;ref&gt;Аndreev, J. ''The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars'' (''Balgarskite hanove i tsare'', ''Българските ханове и царе''), Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, p. 322 ISBN 954-427-216-X.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Serbs were defeated in the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]], Bulgaria and Turkey reached an agreement according to which the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia had a common government, Parliament, administration and army. Today 6 September is celebrated as the Unification Day and the Day of Plovdiv.

===Recent history===
After the unification, Plovdiv remained the second city in Bulgaria in population and significance after the capital [[Sofia]]. The first railway in the city was built in 1874 connecting it with the Ottoman capital, and in 1888 it was linked with Sofia. In 1892 Plovdiv became host of the First Bulgarian Fair with international participation which was succeeded by the [[International Fair Plovdiv]]. After the liberation the first brewery was inaugurated in the city.

In the beginning of the 20th century Plovdiv grew as a significant industrial and commercial center with well-developed light and food industry. In 1927 the electrification of Plovdiv has started. German, French and [[Belgium|Belgian]] capital was invested in the city in development of modern trade, banking and industry. In 1939 there were 16,000 craftsmen and 17,000 workers in manufacturing factories, mainly for food and tobacco processing. During the Second World War the tobacco industry expanded as well as the export of fruit and vegetables. In 1943 1,500 Jews were saved from deportation in [[concentration camp]]s by the archbishop of Plovdiv, [[Patriarch Cyril of Bulgaria|Cyril]], who later became the Bulgarian Patriarch. In 1944 the city was bombed by British-American coalition.

Tobacco Depot workers went on strike on May the 4th, 1953.
On 6 April 1956 the first trolleybus line was opened and in the 1950s the Trimontsium Hotel was constructed. In the 1960s and 1970s there was a construction boom and many of the modern neighborhoods took shape. In the 1970s and 1980s antique remains were excavated and the Old Town was fully restored. In 1990 the sports complex &quot;Plovdiv&quot; was finished. It included the largest stadium and rowing canal in the country. In that period Plovdiv became the birthplace of Bulgaria's movement for democratic reform, which by 1989 had garnered enough support to enter government.

Plovdiv has hosted specialized exhibitions of the [[World's Fair]] in 1981, 1985, and 1991.

Plovdiv was the first geographic location to be featured as a theme day in Reddit's [http://re.reddit.com/r/PictureGame/ Picturegame]&lt;ref&gt;http://re.reddit.com/r/PictureGame/comments/2d6s7q/vote_for_the_theme_on_next_theme_day_saturday_16/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its ethnic character Plovdiv is the second or the third largest cosmopolitan city inhabited by [[Bulgarians]] after [[Sofia]] and possibly [[Varna]]. According to the 2001 census from population of 338 224 inhabitants the Bulgarians were 302 858 (90%). [[Stolipinovo]] in Plovdiv is the largest Roma neighbourhood in the [[Balkans]], having a population of around 20,000 alone, further Roma ghettos are [[Hadji Hassan Mahala]] and [[Sheker Mahala]]. Therefore, the census number is a deflation of the number of Roma people and they are most likely the second largest group after the Bulgarians, most of all because the Muslim Roma in Plovdiv claim to be of Turkish ethnicity and Turkish-speaking at the census (&quot;[[Xoraxane]] Roma&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/facta/pas/pas99/pas99-09.pdf &quot;The Relations of Ethnic and Confessional Consciousness of Roma in Bulgaria&quot;, Elena Marushiakova, Vesselin Popov]&lt;/ref&gt; For further information see the article [[The Roma in Plovdiv|Roma people in Plovdiv]]. Like elsewhere in the country, Roma people are subjected to discrimination and segregation (See the Bulgaria section of the article [[Antiziganism]]).

After the Wars for National Union ([[Balkan Wars]] and World War I) the city became home for thousands of refugees from the former Bulgarian lands in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Western Thrace|Western]] and [[Eastern Thrace]]. Many of the old neighbourhoods are still referred to as ''Belomorski'', ''Vardarski''. Most of the Jews left the city after the foundation of [[Israel]] in 1948, as well as most of the Turks and Greeks.  Prior to the population exchange, as of 1 January 1885, the city of Plovdiv had a population of 33,442, of which 16,752 were [[Bulgarians]] (50%), 7,144 [[Turkish people|Turks]] (21%), 5,497 [[Greeks]] (16%), 2,168 Jews (6%), 1,061 [[Armenians]] (3%), 151 [[Italians]], 112 [[Germans]], 112 [[Romani people]], 80 [[French people]], 61 [[Russians]] and 304 people of other nationalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;histmuseum&quot;/&gt;

The vast majority of the inhabitants are Christians – mostly [[Eastern Orthodox]] — and there are Catholics, [[Eastern Catholic]]s and Protestant trends ([[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Adventists]], [[Baptists]] and others). There are also some [[Muslims]] and Jews. In Plovdiv there are many churches, two mosques and one synagogue (see [[Plovdiv Synagogue]]).

==City government==
Plovdiv is the administrative center of [[Plovdiv Province]], Municipality of Plovdiv, [[Maritsa municipality]] and [[Rodopi municipality]]. The mayor of the Municipality of Plovdiv, [[Ivan Totev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plovdiv.bg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=192&amp;Itemid=196 |title=Кмет |publisher=www.plovdiv.bg |accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the six district mayors represent the local executive authorities. The Municipal Council which consists of 51 municipal counselors, represents the legislative power and is elected according to the proportional system by parties' lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://new.plovdiv.bg/?lang_id=1&amp;prm=power&amp;subprm=plovdiv
 |title=Община Пловдив
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive government of the Municipality of Plovdiv consists of a mayor who is elected by majority representation, five deputy mayors and one administrative secretary. All the deputy mayors and the secretary control their administrative structured units.

According to the ''Law for the territorial subdivision of the Capital municipality and the large cities''&lt;ref&gt;[http://lex.bg/laws/ldoc.php?IDNA=2133624321 Law for the territorial subdivision of the Capital municipality and the large cities], посетен на 16 ноември 2007 г.&lt;/ref&gt; the territory of Plovdiv Municipality is subdivided into six district administrations, their mayors being appointed following approval by the Municipal Council.

In 1969 the villages of [[Proslav]] and [[Komatevo]] were incorporated into the city. In 1987 the municipalities of Maritsa and Rodopi were separated from Plovdiv which remained their administrative center. In the last several years the inhabitants from those villages had taken steps to rejoin the &quot;urban&quot; municipality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.plovdiv24.com/36695.html Темите на 2007–ма: Ягодово – квартал на Пловдив, Plovdiv24.com], 3 February 2008 г.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
The city has more than 200 archaeological sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Balabanov |first=G. |title=This is Bulgaria |publisher=|location=Sofia |page=371 |language=Bulgarian, English |isbn=954-91672-1-6 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 30 of which are of national importance. There are many remains from antiquity – Plovdiv is among the few cities with two ancient theatres; remains of the medieval walls and towers; Ottoman baths and mosques; a well-preserved old quarter from the National Revival period with beautiful houses, churches and narrow paved streets. There are numerous museums, art galleries and cultural institutions. Plovdiv is host to musical, theatrical and film events.

The city is a starting point for trips to places in the region, such as the [[Bachkovo Monastery]] at {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south, the ski-resort [[Pamporovo]] at {{convert|90|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south or the [[spa resort]]s to the north [[Hisarya]], [[Banya, Plovdiv Province|Banya]], Krasnovo, [[Strelcha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Balabanov |first=G. |title=This is Bulgaria |publisher=|location=Sofia |page=395 |language=Bulgarian, English |isbn=954-91672-1-6 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Plovdiv Roman theatre|Ancient theatre (Antichen teatur)]] is probably the best-known monument from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purebulgaria.com/bg_version/cities.php?city_id=165 |title=Античен театър – Пловдив, информация за градове, региони, забележителности:: |publisher=PureBulgaria |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the beginning of the 2nd century during the reign of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Trajan]]. It is situated in the natural saddle between two of the Three Hills. It is divided into two parts with 14 rows each divided with a horizontal lane. The theatre could accommodate up to 7,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ideabg.com/clients/oldtown/en/mesta/antichen.php |title=The Ancient theatre |publisher=Ideabg.com |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-story scene is on the southern part and is decorated with [[frieze]]s, cornices and statues. The theatre was studied, conserved and restored between 1968 and 1984. Many events are still held on the scene&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Пътеводител България |publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа ИК |location=София |page=140 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-9942-32-5 |year=2002 |author=avtori Evgeni Dinchev ...|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Verdi]] festival and the International Folklore festival. The Roman Odeon was restored in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plovdivsite.hit.bg/index_files/Page1308.htm The Roman odeon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025224250/http://www.plovdivsite.hit.bg/index_files/Page1308.htm |date=25 October 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the 2nd–5th centuries and is the second (and smaller) antique [[Odeon of Philippopolis|theatre of Philipopolis]] with 350 seats. It was initially built as a bulevterion – edifice of the city council – and was later reconstructed as a theatre.

The [[Plovdiv Roman Stadium|Ancient Stadium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancient-stadium-plovdiv.eu/?p=12&amp;l=2 The Ancient stadium of Philippopolis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414210531/http://ancient-stadium-plovdiv.eu/?p=12&amp;l=2 |date=14 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is another important monument of the ancient city. It was built in the 2nd century during the reign of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Hadrian]]. It is situated between Danov Hill and one of the Three Hills, nowadays – beneath the main street from Dzhumaya Square to Kamenitsa Square. It was modeled after the stadium in [[Delphi]]. It was approximately 240 meters long and 50 meters wide, and could seat up to 30 000 spectators. The athletic games at the stadium were organised by the General Assembly of the province of Thrace. In their honour the royal mint of Philippopolis coined money featuring the face of the ruling emperor as well as the types of athletic events held in the stadium. Only a small part of the northern section with 14 seat rows can be seen today; the larger part lies under the main street and a number of buildings.

[[Roman Forum (Plovdiv)|The Roman forum]] dates from the reign of [[Vespasian]] in the 1st century and was finished in the 2nd century. It is near the modern post office next to the Odeon. It has an area of 11 hectares and was surrounded by shops and public buildings. The forum was a focal point of the streets of the ancient city.&lt;ref name=&quot;ppdv&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Пътеводител България |publisher=ТАНГРА ТанНакРа ИК |location=София |page=138 |language=Bulgarian |isbn=954-9942-32-5 |year=2002 |author=avtori Evgeni Dinchev ...|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eirene Residence (Plovdiv)|Eirene Residence]] is in the southern part of the Three Hills on the northern part of an ancient street in the Archeological underpass. It includes remains of a public building from the 3rd–4th centuries which belonged to a noble citizen. Eirene is the Christian name for Penelopa – a maiden from Megadon who was converted to Christianity in the 2nd century. There are colourful mosaics which have geometrical forms and figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plovdivsite.hit.bg/index_files/Page910.htm Eirene Archaeological complex]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Nebet Tepe|Nebet hill]] are the remains of the first settlement which in 12th century BC grew to the [[Thrace|Thracian]] city of Eumolpias, one of the first cities in Southeastern Europe. Massive walls surrounding a temple and a palace have been excavated. The oldest part of the fortress was constructed from large syenite blocks – the so-called &quot;cyclopean construction&quot;.
