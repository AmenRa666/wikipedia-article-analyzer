'''Glyphosate''' (''N''-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is a broad-spectrum [[Herbicide#Classification|systemic herbicide]] and [[Crop desiccation|crop desiccant]]. It is an [[organophosphorus compound]], specifically a [[phosphonate]]. It is used to kill [[weed]]s, especially annual [[broadleaf]] weeds and grasses that compete with [[crop]]s. It was discovered to be an herbicide by [[Monsanto]] chemist [[John E. Franz]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 3799758 | status =patent | title = N-phosphonomethyl-glycine phytotoxicant compositions | gdate = 1974-03-26  | fdate = 1971-08-09 | inventor = Franz JE | assign1 = Monsanto Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monsanto brought it to market in 1974 under the trade name '''Roundup''', and Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States [[patent]] expired in 2000.

Farmers quickly adopted glyphosate, especially after Monsanto introduced glyphosate-resistant [[Roundup Ready crops]], enabling farmers to kill weeds without killing their crops. In 2007, glyphosate was the most used herbicide in the United States' agricultural sector and the second-most used in home and garden, government and industry, and commerce.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPAusage&quot;&gt;United States EPA 2007 Pesticide Market Estimates [http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/pestsales/07pestsales/usage2007_2.htm#3_6 Agriculture], [http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/pestsales/07pestsales/usage2007_3.htm#3_7 Home and Garden]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 there was a 100-fold increase from the late 1970s in the frequency of applications and volumes of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) applied, partly in response to the unprecedented global emergence and spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;biomedcentral_2016&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1}}

Glyphosate is absorbed through foliage, and minimally through roots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sprankle P, Meggitt WF, Penner D | title = Rapid inactivation of glyphosate in the soil | journal = Weed Science | date = 1975 | pages = 224–228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPIC Data Sheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=moneuro/&gt; and transported to growing points. It inhibits a plant [[enzyme]] involved in the synthesis of three aromatic amino acids: [[tyrosine]], [[tryptophan]], and [[phenylalanine]]. Therefore, it is effective only on actively growing plants and is not effective as a [[preemergent herbicides|pre-emergence herbicide]]. An increasing number of crops have been [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to be tolerant of glyphosate (e.g. [[Genetically modified soybean#Roundup Ready Soybean|Roundup Ready soybean]], the first Roundup Ready crop, also created by Monsanto) which allows farmers to use glyphosate as a postemergence herbicide against weeds. The development of glyphosate resistance in weed species is emerging as a costly problem. While glyphosate and formulations such as Roundup have been approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment persist.&lt;ref name=&quot;biomedcentral_2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-016-0117-0 | title=Concerns over use of glyphosate-based herbicides and risks associated with exposures: a consensus statement | publisher=Environmental Health | date=February 17, 2016 | accessdate=March 24, 2016 |first1=John Peterson |last1=Myers |first2=Michael N. |last2=Antoniou |first3=Bruce |last3=Blumberg |first4=Lynn |last4=Carroll |first5=Theo |last5=Colborn |first6=Lorne G. |last6=Everett |first7=Michael |last7=Hansen |first8=Philip J. |last8=Landrigan |first9=Bruce P. |last9=Lanphear |first10=Robin |last10=Mesnage |first11=Laura N. |last11=Vandenberg |first12=Frederick S. |last12=vom Saal |first13=Wade V. |last13=Welshons |first14=Charles M. |last14=Benbroo | name-list-format = vanc | pages=13 |doi=10.1186/s12940-016-0117-0 |volume=15 |number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatureonWHO2015/&gt;

Many regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German [[Federal Institute for Risk Assessment]] toxicology review in 2013 found that &quot;the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing&quot; with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] (NHL).&lt;ref name=BFR2014 /&gt; A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified an increased risk of NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations.&lt;ref name=Schinasi/&gt; In March 2015 the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] classified glyphosate as &quot;probably&amp;nbsp;carcinogenic&amp;nbsp;in humans&quot; ([[International Agency for Research on Cancer#IARC categories|category 2A]]) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and ''[[in vitro]]'' studies.&lt;ref name=NatureonWHO2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet20March2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guyton KZ, Loomis D, Grosse Y, El Ghissassi F, Benbrahim-Tallaa L, Guha N, Scoccianti C, Mattock H, Straif K | title = Carcinogenicity of tetrachlorvinphos, parathion, malathion, diazinon, and glyphosate | journal = The Lancet.

==Discovery==
Glyphosate was first synthesized in 1950 by Swiss chemist Henry Martin, who worked for the Swiss company [[Cilag]].  The work was never published.&lt;ref name=Dill&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Nandula | editor-first1 = Vijay K. | title = Glyphosate Resistance in Crops and Weeds: History, Development, and Management | first1 = Gerald M. | last1 = Dill | first2 = R.

Somewhat later, glyphosate was independently discovered at Monsanto in 1970.  Monsanto chemists had synthesized about 100 [[Structural analog|analogs]] of [[aminomethylphosphonic acid]] as potential [[Water softening|water-softening]] agents. Two were found to have weak herbicidal activity, and [[John E. Franz]], a chemist at Monsanto, was asked to try to make analogs with stronger herbicidal activity.

==Chemistry==
Glyphosate is an aminophosphonic analogue of the natural amino acid [[glycine]], and like all amino acids, exists in different ionic states depending on [[pH]].  Both the [[phosphonic acid]] and [[carboxylic acid]] moieties can be ionised and the [[amine]] group can be protonated and the substance exists as a series of [[zwitterion]]s. Glyphosate is soluble in water to 12&amp;nbsp;g/l at room temperature. The original synthetic approach to glyphosate involved the reaction of [[phosphorus trichloride]] with [[formaldehyde]] followed by [[hydrolysis]] to yield a [[phosphonate]].  Glycine is then reacted with this phosphonate to yield glyphosate, and its name is taken as a contraction of the compounds used in this synthesis - viz. '''gly'''cine and a '''phos'''phon'''ate'''.&lt;ref name = Chenier&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gbHeBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;dq=industrial+synthesis+glyphosate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0qaMem46QO&amp;sig=j9HdG08CGoXs5tx_DOmxyPe0Au8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifp6fVsNzJAhXCjpQKHd2HA54Q6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=industrial%20synthesis%20glyphosate&amp;f=false|title = Survey of Industrial Chemistry|author = Chenier, Philip J.|page = 384|year = 2012|publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]|edition = 3rd|isbn = 9781461506034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main deactivation path for glyphosate is hydrolysis to [[aminomethylphosphonic acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlwww.cdpr.ca.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/emon/pubs/fatememo/glyphos.pdf | title = Environmental Fate of Glyphosate | vauthors = Schuette J | format = | work = | publisher = Department of Pesticide Regulation, State of California }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial synthesis===
Two main approaches are used to synthesize glyphosate industrially.  The first is to react [[iminodiacetic acid]] with [[phosphorous acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] (sometimes formed ''in situ'' by addition of phosphorus trichloride) via a modified [[Mannich reaction]]. [[Oxidation]] then leads to the desired glyphosate product.  Iminodiacetic acid is usually prepared on-site, such as by reaction of [[chloroacetic acid]] with [[ammonia]] and [[calcium hydroxide]] to produce the calcium iminodiacetate [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and then acidification of the product.&lt;ref name = Dill /&gt;
[[File:Glyphosate synthesis from chloroacetic acid.svg|600px|centre|[[Iminodiacetic acid]] approach to glyphosate synthesis]]
The chloroacetic acid approach is less efficient than other iminodiacetic acid approaches, owing to the production of [[calcium chloride]] waste and decreased yield.  When [[hydrogen cyanide]] is readily available as a by-product (say), an alternative approach is to use iminodiacetonitrile, HN(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[diethanolamine]] is also a suitable starting material.&lt;ref name = Dill /&gt;

The second involves the use of [[dimethyl phosphite]] in a [[one-pot]] synthesis.  Glycine and [[paraformaldehyde]] are reacted in a suitable organic solvent (typically [[triethylamine]] and [[methanol]]) to produce bishydroxymethylglycine, (HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COOH.  Dimethyl phosphite is then introduced and [[work-up (chemistry)|work-up]] with [[hydrochloric acid]] cleaves the hydroxymethyl group from the nitrogen atom whilst heating speeds the hydrolysis of both phosphate ester linkages.&lt;ref name = Dill /&gt;

==Mode of action==
Glyphosate kills plants by interfering with the synthesis of the [[Aromatic amino acids|aromatic]] amino acids [[phenylalanine]], [[tyrosine]], and [[tryptophan]]. It does this by inhibiting the enzyme [[EPSP synthase|5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase]] (''EPSPS''), which [[Catalysis|catalyzes]] the reaction of [[shikimate]]-3-phosphate (S3P) and [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] to form 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7396959&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steinrücken HC, Amrhein N | title = The herbicide glyphosate is a potent inhibitor of 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimic acid-3-phosphate synthase | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 1207–12 | date = Jun 1980 | pmid = 7396959 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(80)90547-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glyphosate is absorbed through foliage and minimally through roots, meaning that it is only effective on actively growing plants and cannot prevent seeds from germinating.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPIC Data Sheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=moneuro/&gt; After application, glyphosate is readily transported around the plant to growing roots and leaves and this [[Herbicide#Classification|systemic]] activity is important for its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Duke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dill/&gt; Inhibiting the enzyme causes shikimate to accumulate in plant tissues and diverts energy and resources away from other processes.

==Environmental fate==
Glyphosate [[adsorb]]s strongly to [[soil]], and residues are expected to generally be immobile in soil. [[Groundwater|Ground]] and [[surface water]] pollution is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Borggaard, OK and AL Gimsing. 2008. Fate of glyphosate in soil and the possibility of leaching to ground and surface waters: a review. Pest Management Sci. 64:441–456.&lt;/ref&gt; Glyphosate is readily degraded by soil microbes to [[aminomethylphosphonic acid]] (AMPA, which like glyphosate strongly adsorbs to soil solids and is thus unlikely to leach to groundwater). Though both glyphosate and AMPA are commonly detected in water bodies, a portion of the AMPA detected may actually be the result of degradation of detergents rather than from glyphosate.&lt;ref&gt;Botta, F , G Lavisonb, G Couturier, F Alliot, E Moreau-Guigon, N Fauchon, B Guery, M Chevreuil, and H Blanchoud. 2009. Transfer of glyphosate and its degradate AMPA to surface waters through urban sewerage systems. Chemosphere 77 (1): 133–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Glyphosate does have the potential to contaminate surface waters due to its aquatic use patterns and through erosion, as it adsorbs to soil particles suspended in runoff. The mechanism of glyphosate sorption to soil is similar to that of [[phosphate]] fertilizers, the presence of which can reduce glyphosate sorption.&lt;ref&gt;Muniraa, S , A Farenhorsta, D Flatena, and C Grant. 2016.

The [[half-life]] of glyphosate in soil ranges between 2 and 197 days; a typical field half-life of 47 days has been suggested. Soil and climate conditions affect glyphosate's persistence in soil.

Glyphosate is an acid molecule, so it is formulated as a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] for packaging and handling. Various salt formulations include isopropylamine, diammonium, monoammonium, or potassium as the [[counterion]]. Some brands include more than one salt.  Some companies report their product as acid equivalent (ae) of glyphosate acid, or some report it as active ingredient (ai) of glyphosate plus the salt, and others report both. To compare performance of different formulations, knowledge of how the products were formulated is needed.

Products are supplied most commonly in formulations of 120, 240, 360, 480, and 680&amp;nbsp;g/l of active ingredient. The most common formulation in agriculture is 360&amp;nbsp;g/l, either alone or with added [[cationic surfactant]]s.&lt;ref name=AlbertaQuick2015&gt;Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development.

For 360&amp;nbsp;g/l formulations, European regulations allow applications of up to 12 l/ha for control of perennial weeds such as [[Elytrigia repens|couch grass]]. More commonly, rates of 3 l/ha are practiced for control of annual weeds between crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-phy.agriculture.gouv.fr/ e-phy: Le catalogue des produits phytopharmaceutiques et de leurs usages des matières fertilisantes et des supports de culture homologués en France]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monsanto===
[[File:Roundup herbicide logo.jpg|thumb|[[Monsanto]]'s Roundup is the earliest formulation of glyphosate.]]
Monsanto developed and patented the use of glyphosate to kill weeds in the early 1970s, and first brought it to market in 1974, under the Roundup brandname.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duke&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;monsantofaq&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monsanto.com/products/documents/glyphosate-background-materials/back_history.pdf | title=History of Monsanto’s Glyphosate Herbicides | publisher=Monsanto | accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While its initial patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| country = US| number = 3799758 | status = application| title = N-phosphonomethyl-glycine phytotoxicant compositions | pubdate = 1974-03-26| gdate = | fdate = 1971-08-09| pridate = 1971-08-09| invent1 = John E.

As of 2009, sales of these herbicide products represented about 10% of Monsanto's revenue due to competition from other producers of other glyphosate-based herbicides;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14904184|title=The debate over whether Monsanto is a corporate sinner or saint|date=19 November 2009|work=The Economist|accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; their Roundup products (which include [[Genetic engineering|GM]] seeds) represented about half of Monsanto's [[gross margin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/29/monsanto-potash-fertilizer-personal-finance-investing-ideas-agrium-mosaic.html | title = The Seeds Of A Monsanto Short Play | vauthors = Cavallaro M | date = 2009-06-26 | publisher = Forbes | accessdate = 2009-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[active ingredient]] of the Monsanto herbicides is the [[isopropylamine]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] of glyphosate. Another important ingredient in some formulations is the [[surfactant]] [[polyethoxylated tallow amine]].

Monsanto also produces seeds which grow into plants genetically engineered to be tolerant to glyphosate. The genes contained in these seeds are patented. Such crops allow farmers to use glyphosate as a postemergence herbicide against most broadleaf and cereal weeds. Soy was the first [[Genetically modified crops#Glyphosate resistance|glyphosate-resistant crop]].

==Toxicity==
Glyphosate is the active ingredient in herbicide formulations containing it.  However, in addition to glyphosate salts, commercial formulations of glyphosate contain additives such as [[surfactant]]s which vary in nature and concentration. The surfactants are added to enable the glyphosate to penetrate the cuticle of the plants. Toxicologists have studied glyphosate alone and formulations.

===Glyphosate alone===

====Humans====
Many regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that &quot;the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing&quot; with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=BFR2014 /&gt;

Early epidemiological studies did not find associations between long-term, low-level exposure to glyphosate and any disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21798302&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mink PJ, Mandel JS, Lundin JI, Sceurman BK | title = Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and non-cancer health outcomes: a review | journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 172–84 | date = Nov 2011 | pmid = 21798302 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2011.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mink_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mink PJ, Mandel JS, Sceurman BK, Lundin JI | title = Epidemiologic studies of glyphosate and cancer: a review | journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 440–52 | date = Aug 2012 | pmid = 22683395 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2012.05.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22202229&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams AL, Watson RE, DeSesso JM | title = Developmental and reproductive outcomes in humans and animals after glyphosate exposure: a critical analysis | journal = Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health.

A 2014 review article reported a significant association between [[B-cell lymphoma]] and glyphosate occupational exposure.&lt;ref name=Schinasi /&gt; In March 2015, the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] classified glyphosate as 
&quot;probably&amp;nbsp;carcinogenic&amp;nbsp;in humans&quot; ([[International Agency for Research on Cancer#IARC categories|category 2A]]) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and ''in vitro'' studies.&lt;ref name=NatureonWHO2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet20March2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=IARC20March2015/&gt; However, in 2016 a joint meeting of the United Nations (FAO) Panel of Experts on Pesticide Residues in Food and the Environment and the World Health Organization  Core Assessment Group on Pesticide Residues concluded that based on the available evidence &quot;glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHOandUN2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf?ua=1|title= JOINT FAO/WHO MEETING ON PESTICIDE RESIDUES

====Other mammals====
Amongst mammals, glyphosate is considered to have &quot;low to very low toxicity&quot;. The [[LD50|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] of glyphosate is 5,000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg for rats, 10,000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in mice and 3,530&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in goats. The acute dermal LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in rabbits is greater than 2,000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.  Indications of glyphosate toxicity in animals typically appear within 30 to 120 minutes following ingestion of a large enough dose, and include initial excitability and [[tachycardia]], [[ataxia]], depression, and [[bradycardia]], although severe toxicity can develop into collapse and convulsions.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPIC Data Sheet&quot;/&gt;

A review of unpublished short-term rabbit-feeding studies reported severe toxicity effects at 150&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day and &quot;[[NOAEL|no observed adverse effect level]]&quot; doses ranging from 50 to 200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimmel|first1=Gary|title=Evaluation of developmental toxicity studies of glyphosate with attention to cardiovascular development|journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology|date=2013|volume=43|issue=2|pages=79–95|doi=10.3109/10408444.2012.749834|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/10408444.2012.749834#.VeW7M_lViko|pmid=23286529|pmc=3581053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glyphosate can have carcinogenic effects in nonhuman mammals.  These include the induction of positive trends in the incidence of [[Kidney cancer|renal tubule carcinoma]] and [[haemangiosarcoma]] in male mice, and increased [[Pancreatic cancer|pancreatic islet-cell adenoma]] in male rats.&lt;ref name=Lancet20March2015 /&gt;

Glyphosate-based herbicides may cause life-threatening arrhythmias in mammals. Evidence also shows that such herbicides cause direct electrophysiological changes in the cardiovascular systems of rats and rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gress S, Lemoine S, Séralini GE, Puddu PE | title = Glyphosate-based herbicides potently affect cardiovascular system in mammals: review of the literature | journal = Cardiovascular Toxicology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–26 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25245870 | doi = 10.1007/s12012-014-9282-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other aquatic fauna====
In freshwater invertebrates (species unspecified), glyphosate has a 48-hour LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ranging from 55 to 780 ppm. The 96-hour LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is 281 ppm for [[grass shrimp]] (''Palaemonetas vulgaris'') and 934 ppm for [[fiddler crabs]] (''Uca pagilator''). These values make glyphosate &quot;slightly toxic to practically non-toxic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPIC Data Sheet&quot;/&gt;

====Antimicrobial activity====
The [[antimicrobial]] activity of glyphosate has been described in the microbiology literature since its discovery in 1970 and the description of glyphosate's mechanism of action in 1972. Efficacy was described for numerous bacteria and fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham William (Wildwood.

Glyphosate can control the growth of [[apicomplexa]]n parasites, such as ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' (malaria), and ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]'', and has been considered an antimicrobial agent in mammals.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11865437&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts CW, Roberts F, Lyons RE, Kirisits MJ, Mui EJ, Finnerty J, Johnson JJ, Ferguson DJ, Coggins JR, Krell T, Coombs GH, Milhous WK, Kyle DE, Tzipori S, Barnwell J, Dame JB, Carlton J, McLeod R | title = The shikimate pathway and its branches in apicomplexan parasites | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 185 | issue = Suppl 1  | pages = S25–36 | date = Feb 2002 | pmid = 11865437 | doi = 10.1086/338004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soil biota====
[[File:Glyphosate degradation.svg|thumb|Degradation pathway of glyphosate in the ground&lt;ref name=Giesy2000/&gt;]]

===Glyphosate-based formulations===
Glyphosate-based formulations  may contain a number of [[Agricultural spray adjuvant|adjuvants]], the identities of which are considered trade secrets.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.epa.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/pesticide-registration-manual |title=Pesticide Registration Manual &amp;#124; Pesticide Registration &amp;#124; US EPA |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surfactants are used in herbicide formulations as [[wetting]] agents, to maximize coverage and aid penetration of the herbicide(s) through plant leaves. As agricultural spray adjuvants, surfactants may be mixed into commercial formulations, such as Roundup, or they may be purchased separately and mixed on-site (tank mix).

[[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]] (POEA) is a surfactant used in the original Roundup formulation and was still being commonly used in 2015.&lt;ref name=usgs.glyphosate.poea&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring POEA, a Surfactant Mixture in Herbicide Formulations|url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/glyphosate_poea.html|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions of Roundup have included different percentages of POEA. Although Monsanto [http://www.monsanto.com/sitecollectiondocuments/ito/roundup%20promax_factsheet_april%202010_final%20.pdf product fact sheets] do not disclose surfactants and their percentages, a 1997 US government report said that Roundup is 15% POEA while Roundup Pro is 14.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs.fed.us&quot;/&gt; A review of the literature provided to the EPA in 1997 found that POEA was more toxic to fish than glyphosate was.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs.fed.us&quot;/&gt; POEA is more toxic to fish and amphibians than glyphosate alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs.fed.us&quot;&gt;Gary L.

A 2000 review concluded that &quot;under present and expected conditions of new use, there is no potential for Roundup herbicide to pose a health risk to humans&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wkc00&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams GM, Kroes R, Munro IC | title = Safety evaluation and risk assessment of the herbicide Roundup and its active ingredient, glyphosate, for humans | journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology | volume = 31 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 117–65 | date = Apr 2000 | pmid = 10854122 | doi = 10.1006/rtph.1999.1371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 review by the European Union reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlec.europa.eu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/ph_ps/pro/eva/existing/list1_glyphosate_en.pdf | title = Review report for the active substance glyphosate | date = 2002-01-21 | format = | work = Commission working document | publisher = European Commission, Health and Protection Directorate-General: Directorate E – Food Safety: plant health, animal health and welfare, international questions: E1 - Plant Health }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 meta-analysis of all epidemiological studies of exposure to glyphosate formulations found no correlation with any kind of cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mink_2012&quot;/&gt;  The 2013 systematic review by the German Institute for Risk Assessment of epidemiological studies of workers who use pesticides, exposed to glyphosate formulations found no significant risk, stating that &quot;the available data are contradictory and far from being convincing&quot;.&lt;ref name=BFR2014/&gt;{{rp|Volume 1, p64-66}}  However, a 2014 meta-analysis of the same studies found a correlation between occupational exposure to glyphosate formulations and increased risk of [[B cell lymphoma]], the most common kind of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

[[Acute toxicity]] is dose-related; Skin exposure to ready-to-use glyphosate formulations can cause irritation, and [[Contact dermatitis#Photocontact dermatitis|photocontact dermatitis]] has been occasionally reported.

====Other animals====
A 2000 review of the ecotoxicological data on Roundup shows at least 58 studies exist on the effects of Roundup on a range of organisms.&lt;ref name=Giesy2000&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-1156-3_2 |title=Ecotoxicological risk assessment for Roundup® herbicide |journal=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |year=2000 | vauthors = Giesy JP,  Dobson S,  Solomon KR | isbn = 978-0-387-95102-7 | volume = 167 | pages = 35–120 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7iTdm5ii4NYC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review concluded, &quot;...for terrestrial uses of Roundup minimal acute and chronic risk was predicted for potentially exposed non-target organisms&quot;.

====Fish====
Monsanto and other companies produce glyphosate products with alternative surfactants specifically formulated for aquatic use, for example the Monsanto products &quot;Biactive&quot; and &quot;AquaMaster&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;url_backrounder_aquatic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/glyphosate-background-materials/bkg_amphib_05a.pdf | title =Response to &quot;The impact of insecticides and herbicides on the biodiversity and productivity of aquatic communities&quot; | date = 2005-04-01 | format = PDF | work = Backgrounder | publisher = Monsanto Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;url_backgrounder_Aquatic_Australia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/glyphosate-background-materials/gly_austfrog_bkg.pdf | title = Aquatic Use of Glyphosate Herbicides in Australia | date = 2003-05-01 | format = PDF | work = Backgrounder | publisher = Monsanto Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glyphosate formulations are much more toxic for amphibians and fish than glyphosate alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs.fed.us&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mann RM, Hyne RV, Choung CB, Wilson SP | title = Amphibians and agricultural chemicals: Review of the risks in a complex environment|journal=Environmental Pollution|year=2009|volume=157|issue=11|pages=2903–2927|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The half-life of POEA (21–42 days) is longer than that for glyphosate (7–14 days) in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mesnage&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mesnage R, Defarge N, Spiroux de Vendômois J, Séralini GE | title = Potential toxic effects of glyphosate and its commercial formulations below regulatory limits | journal = Food Chem.

====Amphibians====
Some researchers have suggested the toxicity effects of pesticides on amphibians may be different from those of other aquatic fauna because of their lifestyle; amphibians may be more susceptible to the toxic effects of pesticides because they often prefer to breed in shallow, [[lentic]], or ephemeral pools. These habitats do not necessarily constitute formal water-bodies and can contain higher concentrations of pesticide compared to larger water-bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Govindarajulu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | vauthors= Govindarajulu PP | year = 2008 | title = Literature Review of Impacts of Glyphosate Herbicide on Amphibians: What Risks can the Silvicultural Use of this Herbicide Pose for Amphibians in BC?|publisher=British Columbia, Ecosystems Branch, Ministry of Environment|accessdate=December 12, 2015|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.314.3577&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies in a variety of amphibians have shown the toxicity of GBFs containing POEA to amphibian larvae.  These effects include interference with gill morphology and mortality from either the loss of osmotic stability or asphyxiation. At sub-lethal concentrations, exposure to POEA or glyphosate/POEA formulations have been reported to be associated with delayed development, accelerated development, reduced size at [[metamorphosis]], developmental malformations of the tail, mouth, eye and head, histological indications of intersex and symptoms of oxidative stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann&quot; /&gt;

A 2003 study of various formulations of glyphosate found, &quot;[the] risk assessments based on estimated and measured concentrations of glyphosate that would result from its use for the control of undesirable plants in wetlands and over-water situations showed that the risk to aquatic organisms is negligible or small at application rates less than 4 kg/ha and only slightly greater at application rates of 8 kg/ha.&quot;&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Solomon KR, Thompson DG | title = Ecological risk assessment for aquatic organisms from over-water uses of glyphosate | journal = Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health.

A 2013 [[meta-analysis]] reviewed the available data related to potential impacts of glyphosate-based herbicides on amphibians. According to the authors, the use of glyphosate-based pesticides cannot be considered the major cause of amphibian decline, the bulk of which occurred prior to the widespread use of glyphosate or in pristine tropical areas with minimal glyphosate exposure. The authors recommended further study of species- and development-stage chronic toxicity, of environmental glyphosate levels, and ongoing analysis of data relevant to determining what if any role glyphosate might be playing in worldwide amphibian decline, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner N, Reichenbecher W, Teichmann H, Tappeser B, Lötters S | title = Questions concerning the potential impact of glyphosate-based herbicides on amphibians | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry / SETAC | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 1688–700 | date = Aug 2013 | pmid = 23637092 | doi = 10.1002/etc.2268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glyphosate-based formulations can cause [[oxidative stress]] in bullfrog tadpoles and Pacific oysters.&lt;ref name=iarcmono&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol112/mono112-02.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905094833/http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol112/mono112-02.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-05|title=IARC monograph on glyphosate|publisher=IARC|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect on plant health====
A correlation was found between an increase in the infection rate of wheat by ''[[Fusarium]]'' head blight and the application of glyphosate, but &quot;because of the nature of this study, we could not determine if the association between previous GF (glyphosate formulation) use and FHB development was a cause-effect relationship&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandeza&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2135/cropsci2004.0197 |title=Crop Production Factors Associated with Fusarium Head Blight in Spring Wheat in Eastern Saskatchewan |year=2005 | vauthors = Fernandez MR, Selles F, Gehl D, Depauw RM, Zentner RP | journal = Crop Science | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 1908–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found causal relationships between glyphosate and decreased disease resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-5799-1_15 |chapter=Interactions of Synthetic Herbicides with Plant Disease and Microbial Herbicides |title=Novel Biotechnologies for Biocontrol Agent Enhancement and Management |series=NATO Security through Science Series |year=2007 | vauthors = Duke SO, Wedge DE, Cerdeira AL, Matallo MB | isbn = 978-1-4020-5797-7 | pages = 277–96 | editor1-first = Maurizio | editor1-last = Vurro | editor2-first = Jonathan | editor2-last = Gressel | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to glyphosate has been shown to change the species composition of [[Endophyte|endophytic bacteria]] in plant hosts, which is highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenblueth M, Martínez-Romero E | title = Bacterial endophytes and their interactions with hosts | journal = Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pages = 827–37 | date = Aug 2006 | pmid = 16903349 | doi = 10.1094/MPMI-19-0827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endocrine disruption====
In 2007, the EPA selected glyphosate for further screening through its Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). Selection for this program is based on a compound's prevalence of use and does not imply particular suspicion of endocrine activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = United States Environmental Protection Agency | journal = Federal Register | volume = 72 | issue = 116 | pages = 33486–503 | date = 18 June 2007 | title = Draft List of Initial Pesticide Active Ingredients and Pesticide Inerts to be Considered for Screening under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act | url = http://www.epa.gov/endo/pubs/draft_list_frn_061807.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, 2015 the EPA released Weight of Evidence Conclusion of the EDSP Tier 1 screening for glyphosate, recommending that glyphosate not be considered for Tier 2 testing.

====US Environmental Protection Agency====
The [[EPA]], which last reviewed glyphosate in 1993, considers glyphosate to be [[carcinogenic|noncarcinogenic]] and relatively low in [[dermal]] and  oral acute toxicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa_reds&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/0178fact.pdf | title = Registration Decision Fact Sheet for Glyphosate (EPA-738-F-93-011) | year = 1993 | format = PDF | work = R.E.D. FACTS | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EPA considered a &quot;worst case&quot; dietary risk model of an individual eating a lifetime of food derived entirely from glyphosate-sprayed fields with residues at their maximum levels. This model indicated that no adverse health effects would be expected under such conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa_reds&quot; /&gt; In 2015, the EPA initiated a review glyphosate's toxicity and in 2016 reported their conclusion that glyphosate is likely not carcinogenic.&lt;ref name=NatureonWHO2015&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Daniel | last1 = Cressey | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nature.com/news/widely-used-herbicide-linked-to-cancer-1.17181 | title = Widely used herbicide linked to cancer | journal = Nature | date = March 25, 2015 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2015.17181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Charles|first=Dan|date=17 September 2016|title=EPA Weighs In On Glyphosate, Says It Doesn't Cause Cancer|url=http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/17/494301343/epa-weighs-in-on-glyphosate-says-it-doesnt-cause-cancer|newspaper=[[NPR]]|location= |access-date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International Agency for Research on Cancer====
In March 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]''' '''published a summary of their forthcoming monograph on glyphosate, and classified glyphosate as &quot;probably&amp;nbsp;carcinogenic&amp;nbsp;in humans&quot; (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and ''in vitro'' studies. It noted that there was &quot;limited evidence&quot; of carcinogenicity in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&lt;ref name=NatureonWHO2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet20March2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=IARC20March2015&gt;{{cite web | title = Press release: IARC Monographs Volume 112: evaluation of five organophosphate insecticides and herbicides | date = March 20, 2015 | url = http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/iarcnews/pdf/MonographVolume112.pdf | publisher = International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = Michael | last1 = Specter | name-list-format = vanc | work = New Yorker | date = 10 April 2015 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/roundup-and-risk-assessment | title = Roundup and Risk Assessment | quote = 'Probable’ means that there was enough evidence to say it is more than possible, but not enough evidence to say it is a carcinogen,&quot; Aaron Blair, a lead researcher on the IARC’s study, said.

The IARC classifies substances for their carcinogenic potential, and &quot;a few positive findings can be enough to declare a hazard, even if there are negative studies, as well.&quot; Unlike the BfR, it does not conduct a so-called [[risk assessment]] weighing benefits against risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/business/energy-environment/decades-after-monsantos-roundup-gets-an-all-clear-a-cancer-agency-raises-concerns.html | title = Weed Killer, Long Cleared, Is Doubted | first = Andrew | last = Pollack | name-list-format = vanc | date = 27 March 2015 | publisher = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BfR responded that IARC reviewed only a selection of what they had reviewed earlier, and argued that other studies, including a cohort study called 'Agricultural Health Study', do not support the classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/343/loest-glyphosat-krebs-aus.pdf | title = Löst glyphosat Krebs aus?

In response to resistant weeds, farmers are hand-weeding, using tractors to turn over soil between crops, and using other herbicides in addition to glyphosate.

Monsanto scientists have found that some resistant weeds have as many as 160 extra copies of a gene called ''[[EPSP synthase|EPSPS]],'' the enzyme glyphosate disrupts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = With BioDirect, Monsanto Hopes RNA Sprays Can Someday Deliver Drought Tolerance and Other Traits to Plants on Demand | work = [[MIT Technology Review]] | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/540136/the-next-great-gmo-debate | accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ryegrass====
[[File:Starr 001026-9002 Lolium perenne.jpg|thumb|[[Ryegrass]] ''Lolium perenne'']]
Glyphosate-resistant [[ryegrass]] (''Lolium'') has occurred in most of the Australian agricultural areas and other areas of the world. All cases of evolution of resistance to glyphosate in Australia were characterized by intensive use of the herbicide while no other effective weed control practices were used. Studies indicate the resistant ryegrass does not compete well against nonresistant plants and their numbers decrease when not grown under conditions of glyphosate application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Decade of Glyphosate-Resistant Lolium around the World: Mechanisms, Genes, Fitness, and Agronomic Management |year=2009 |vauthors=Preston C, Wakelin AM, Dolman FC, Bostamam Y, Boutsalis P | journal = Weed Science | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 435–41 | doi = 10.1614/WS-08-181.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal cases==

===Advertising controversy===
''The New York Times'' reported that in 1996, &quot;Dennis C. Vacco, the Attorney General of New York, ordered the company Monsanto to pull ads that said Roundup was &quot;safer than table salt&quot; and &quot;practically nontoxic&quot; to mammals, birds and fish. The company withdrew the spots, but also said that the phrase in question was permissible under E.P.A. guidelines.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;urlMonsanto recruits the horticulturist of the San Diego Zoo to pitch its popular herbicide. - New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/29/business/monsanto-recruits-horticulturist-san-diego-zoo-pitch-its-popular-herbicide.html?ref=monsantocompany | title = Monsanto recruits the horticulturist of the San Diego Zoo to pitch its popular herbicide | author = Charry T | date = 1997-05-29 | format = | work = Business Day | publisher = New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, French environmental and consumer rights campaigners brought a case against Monsanto for misleading the public about the [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]] of its herbicide Roundup, on the basis that glyphosate, Roundup's main component, is classed as &quot;dangerous for the environment&quot; and &quot;toxic for aquatic organisms&quot; by the [[European Union]]. Monsanto's advertising for Roundup had presented it as biodegradable and as leaving the soil clean after use. In 2007, Monsanto was convicted of false advertising and was fined 15,000 euros. Monsanto's French distributor Scotts France was also fined 15,000 euros. Both defendants were ordered to pay damages of 5,000 euros to the Brittany Water and Rivers Association and 3,000 euros to the Consommation Logement Cadre de vie, one of the two main general consumer associations in France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terradaily.com/2006/070126154451.ovopjxml.html &quot;Monsanto fined in France for 'false' herbicide ads&quot;].
