The '''Antonov An-225 ''Mriya''''' ({{lang-uk|Антонов Ан-225 ''Мрія'' (dream or inspiration)}}, [[NATO]] [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]]: &quot;'''Cossack'''&quot;) is a [[strategic airlift]] [[cargo aircraft]] that was designed by the [[Antonov|Antonov Design Bureau]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s. It is powered by six turbofan engines and is the longest and heaviest airplane ever built, with a [[maximum takeoff weight]] of {{convert|640|t|ST|LT}}. It also has the largest wingspan of any aircraft in operational service. The single example built has the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] civil registration '''UR-82060'''. A second airframe was partially built; its completion was halted because of lack of funding and interest.

The Antonov An-225, initially developed for the task of transporting the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] [[spaceplane]], was an enlargement of the successful [[Antonov An-124]]. The first and only An-225 was completed in 1988. After successfully fulfilling its Soviet military missions, it was [[Aircraft boneyard|mothballed]] for eight years. It was then refurbished and re-introduced, and is in commercial operation with [[Antonov Airlines]] carrying oversized payloads.&lt;ref name=&quot;FlightglobalWorldsLargestAircraftAn-225EmergesToSetNewLiftRecord&quot;/&gt; The airlifter holds the absolute world records for an airlifted single-item payload of {{convert|189980|kg|lb|abbr=off|lk=on}},&lt;ref name= &quot;Armenia1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Armenia2&quot; /&gt; and an airlifted total payload of {{convert|253820|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAI_payload_record&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7129 |title=Payload record in the official FAI database |accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ramAn225&quot;&gt;[http://ram-home.com/ram-old/an-225.html An-225 (An-225-100) &quot;Мрiя&quot;].

==Development==
The Antonov An-225 was designed to airlift the [[Energia]] [[rocket]]'s [[Zenit (rocket family)#Energia booster|booster]]s and the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'']] space shuttle for the [[Soviet space program]]. It was developed as a replacement for the [[Myasishchev VM-T]]. The An-225's original mission and objectives are almost identical to that of the United States' [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;goebel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avantgt.html#m3 |title=Antonov An-225 Mriya (&quot;Cossack&quot;) |work=The Antonov Giants: An-22, An-124, &amp; An-225 |accessdate=21 August 2012 |author=Greg Goebel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goebMriya&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vectorsite.net/tashutl_c08.html#m1 |title=The Soviet Buran shuttle program |work=Postscript: The Other Shuttles |accessdate=21 August 2012 |author=Greg Goebel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The An-225 first flew on 21 December 1988 with a 74-minute flight from Kiev. The aircraft was on static display at the [[Paris Air Show]] in 1989 and it flew during the public days at the [[Farnborough air show]] in 1990. Two aircraft were ordered, but only one An-225 ([[Aircraft registration|registration]] CCCP-82060 later UR-82060&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/open.file?id=1154941&amp;size=L|title=Aviation Photo #1154941: Antonov An-225 Mriya - Antonov Design Bureau|work=airliners.net|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was finished. It can carry ultra-heavy and oversize freight, up to {{convert|250000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} internally,&lt;ref name=&quot;goebel&quot;/&gt; or {{convert|200000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} on the upper fuselage.

A second An-225 was partially built during the late 1980s for the Soviet space program. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the cancellation of the Buran space program, the lone operational An-225 was placed in storage in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=389 Antonov An-225 Mriya]. Airliners.net.&lt;/ref&gt; The six [[Ivchenko-Progress]] engines were removed for use on An-124s, and the second uncompleted An-225 airframe was also stored. The first An-225 was later re-engined and put into service.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramAn225&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=mf&gt;&quot;[http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=58 Antonov An-225 Mriya (Cossack) Heavy Lift Strategic Long-Range Transport]&quot; ''Military Factory'', 23 August 2012. Retrieved: 6 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, the need for additional An-225 capacity had become apparent, so the decision was made in September 2006 to complete the second An-225. The second airframe was scheduled for completion around 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationexplorer.com/Antonov_AN-225.html Antonov An-225 Mriya Aircraft History, Facts and Pictures].

==Design==
[[File:Antonov-225 main landing gear 2.jpg|thumb|left|An-225 main landing gear]]

Based on Antonov's earlier [[Antonov An-124|An-124]], the An-225 has fuselage barrel extensions added fore and aft of the wings. The wings also received root extensions to increase span. Two more [[Progress D-18T]] [[turbofan]] engines were added to the new [[wing root]]s, bringing the total to six. An increased-capacity [[landing gear]] system with 32 wheels was designed, some of which are steerable, enabling the aircraft to turn within a {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=mid|-wide}} runway. Like its An-124 predecessor, the An-225 has nose gear designed to [[Kneeling|kneel]] so cargo can be more easily loaded and unloaded.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramAn225&quot;/&gt; Unlike the An-124, which has a rear cargo door and ramp, the An-225 design left these off to save weight, and the [[empennage]] design was changed from a single [[vertical stabilizer]] to a [[twin tail]] with an oversized [[Stabilizer (aircraft)|horizontal stabilizer]]. The twin tail was essential to enable the plane to carry large, heavy external loads that would disturb the [[aerodynamics|airflow]] around a conventional tail. Unlike the An-124, the An-225 was not intended for [[Airlift#Tactical airlift|tactical airlifting]] and is not designed for [[STOL|short-field operation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;goebel&quot;/&gt;

[[File:An-225 D-18T.jpg|thumb|An-225 [[Ivchenko Progress D-18T]] turbofan engines]]
Initially the An-225 had a maximum gross weight of {{convert|600|t|ST|LT|abbr=on}}, but from 2000 to 2001 the aircraft underwent modifications at a cost of US$20M such as the addition of a reinforced floor, which increased the maximum gross weight to {{convert|640|t|ST|LT|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forward&quot;&gt;Forward, David C: &quot;Antonov's Dream Machine&quot;, p. 23.

Both the earlier and later takeoff weights establish the An-225 as the world's heaviest aircraft, being heavier than the double-deck [[Airbus A380]]. It is surpassed in other size-related categories, however: Airbus claims to have improved upon the An-225's maximum landing weight by landing an A380 at {{convert|591.7|t|lb}} during tests,&lt;ref name=&quot;FlightglobalAirbusRevealsA380-LinkedPilotSystemsSecrets&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Learmount|first1=David|title=Airbus reveals A380-linked pilot systems secrets|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-reveals-a380-linked-pilot-systems-secrets-327310/|accessdate=9 July 2009|publisher=[[Flightglobal]]|date=3 June 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules]], known as the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;, has a greater wingspan and a greater overall height. But the Spruce Goose is 20% shorter and overall lighter, due to the materials used in its construction. It only flew once, making the An-225 the largest aircraft in the world to fly multiple times.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramAn225&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avzone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaviationzone.com/factsheets/an225.asp |title=Antonov An-225 Mryia (Cossack) |work=The Aviation Zone |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:An-225-manchester-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Antonov An-225 at [[Manchester Airport]] in 2006]]

During the last years of the [[Soviet space program]], the An-225 was employed as the prime method of transporting the [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran'']] space shuttle.&lt;ref name=&quot;avzone&quot;/&gt;

===Antonov commercialization===
[[File:Mriya at Bangor International Airport, April 11 2015.jpg|thumb|Taxiing during a refueling stop at [[Bangor International Airport]].]]

In the late 1980s, the Soviet government was looking to generate revenue from its military assets. In 1989, the Antonov Design Bureau set up a holding company as a heavy airlift shipping corporation under the name &quot;[[Antonov Airlines]]&quot;, based in [[Kiev]], Ukraine and operating from [[London Luton Airport]] in partnership with the [[Air Foyle HeavyLift]].&lt;ref name=&quot;antonov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;goleta&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.air-and-space.com/Antonov%20An-225%20Mriya.htm |work=Goleta Air &amp; Space Museum |title=An-225 Mriya, NATO: Cossack |accessdate=31 March 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company began operations with a fleet of four An-124-100s and three [[Antonov An-12]]s, but a need for aircraft larger than the An-124 became apparent in the late 1990s. In response, the original An-225 was re-engined, modified for heavy cargo transport, and placed back in service under the management of Antonov Airlines.

[[File:An-225 Mriya.jpg|thumb|Antonov An-225 at [[Gostomel Airport]], [[Ukraine]]]]
On 23 May 2001, the An-225 received its type certificate from the Interstate Aviation Committee Aviation Register (IAC AR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mak.ru/english/kommissions/aviareg/certificates/sertifikati_tipa_na_vozdushnie_suda.html |title=Type Certificates for Aircraft |accessdate=2007-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430200431/http://www.mak.ru/english/kommissions/aviareg/certificates/sertifikati_tipa_na_vozdushnie_suda.html |archivedate=30 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 2001, carrying four [[main battle tank]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;ramAn225&quot;/&gt; at a record load of {{convert|253.82|t|ST}} of cargo,&lt;ref name=&quot;FAI_payload_record&quot;/&gt; the An-225 flew at an altitude of up to {{convert|10750|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;FAI_250t_height&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7133 |title=Height record with 250t payload in the FAI database}}&lt;/ref&gt; over a closed circuit of {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} at a speed of {{convert|763.2|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAI_250t_speed_record&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7131 |title=Speed record with 250t payload over 1000km closed circuit in the official FAI database |accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Special planes: The Antonov-225 Mriya&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2006/4/8/13392/35796 |title= Special planes: The Antonov-225 &quot;Mriya&quot; |publisher=European Tribune |date= 8 April 2006 |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular commercial flights===
The type's first flight in commercial service departed from [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] on 3 January 2002, and flew to [[Thumrait, Oman]] with 216,000 prepared meals for American military personnel based in the region. This vast number of ready meals was transported on some 375 pallets and weighed 187.5 tons.&lt;ref name=airfoyle2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airfoyle.co.uk/services/an225.asp |work=AirFoyle |title=Antonov Airlines:An-225 Mriya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The An-225 has since become the workhorse of the Antonov Airlines fleet, transporting objects once thought impossible to move by air, such as 150-tonne generators. It has become an asset to international relief organizations for its ability to quickly transport huge quantities of emergency supplies during disaster relief operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;aircraft info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aircraft-info.net/aircraft/jet_aircraft/antonov/AN-225 |work=Aircraft-Info.net |title=Antonov An-225 |accessdate=15 February 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401135622/http://www.aircraft-info.net/aircraft/jet_aircraft/antonov/AN-225 |archivedate=1 April 2004 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The An-225 has been contracted by the Canadian and U.S. governments to transport military supplies to the Middle East in support of coalition forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;aircraft info&quot;/&gt; An example of the cost of shipping cargo by An-225 was over 2 million [[Danish krone|DKK]] (approx. €266,000) for flying a chimney duct from [[Billund Airport|Billund]], [[Denmark]] to [[Kazakhstan]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;steelcon&quot;&gt;[http://www.steelcon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/Steelcon__News_GB.pdf Steelcon News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716133659/http://www.steelcon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/News/Steelcon__News_GB.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}. steelcon.com.
