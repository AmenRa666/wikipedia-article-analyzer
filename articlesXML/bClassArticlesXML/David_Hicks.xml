'''David Matthew Hicks (محمد داود/ديفيد ماثيو هيكس)'''  (born 7 August 1975) is an Australian former convicted terrorist. He was convicted by the United States [[Guantanamo military commission]] under the ''[[Military Commissions Act of 2006]]'', on charges of [[providing material support for terrorism]]. The conviction was overturned by the U.S. [[Court of Military Commission Review]] in February 2015.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2015-02-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=BorderMail2015-02-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennet|first1=James|title=David Hicks wins appeal against terrorism conviction in US military court in Cuba|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-19/david-hicks-wins-appeal-against-terrorism-conviction/6144340|accessdate=18 February 2015|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumsfeld]]'', that the [[Guantanamo military commission|military commission system]] was unconstitutional. The military commission system was re-established by an act of the [[United States Congress]].

Revised charges were filed against Hicks in February 2007 before a new commission under the new act.&lt;ref name=&quot;charges-2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AD+PR-MR-2007&quot;/&gt; The following month, in accordance with a pre-trial agreement struck with [[convening authority]] Judge [[Susan J. Crawford]], Hicks entered an [[Alford plea]] to a single newly codified charge of providing material support for terrorism. Hicks's legal team attributed his acceptance of the [[plea bargain]] to his &quot;desperation for release from Guantanamo&quot; and duress under &quot;instances of severe beatings, sleep deprivation and other conditions of detention that contravene international human rights norms.&quot;

In April 2007, Hicks was returned to Australia to serve the remaining nine months of a suspended seven-year sentence. During this period, he was precluded from all media contact. There was criticism that the government delayed his release until after the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 Australian election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ackland|first=Richard|title=Stench of Hicks prosecution lingers as court exposes its flimsy basis|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/stench-of-hicks-prosecution-lingers-as-court-exposes-its-flimsy-basis-20121018-27tsb.html|accessdate=19 October 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morris Davis|Colonel Morris Davis]], the former [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] chief [[prosecutor]], later alleged political interference in the case by the [[Presidency of George W.

In a March 2000 letter to his family, Hicks wrote:

In another letter on 10 August 2000, Hicks wrote from Kashmir claiming to have been a guest of Pakistan's army for two weeks at the front in the &quot;controlled war&quot; with [[India]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I got to fire hundreds of bullets. Most Muslim countries impose hanging for civilians arming themselves for conflict.

During this period, Hicks kept a notebook to document his training in weapon use, explosives, and military tactics, in which he wrote that guerrilla warfare involved &quot;sacrifice for Allah&quot;. He took extensive notes on, and made sketches of, various weaponry mechanisms and attack strategies (including [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] submachine guns, the [[M16 rifle|M16]] assault rifle, RPG-7 grenade launcher, anti-tank rockets, and VIP security infiltration).&lt;ref name=&quot;AUS20080220_LETDiary&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/diary-reveals-hicks-terror-training/story-e6frg6p6-1111115595426 |title='Jihad' diary reveals David Hicks terror training |author=Walker, Jamie |work=The Australian |date=20 February 2008 |accessdate=20 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Letters to his family detailed his training:

In January 2001, Hicks was provided with funding and an introductory letter from Lashkar-e-Taiba. He travelled to Afghanistan to attend training.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCC2004&quot;/&gt; According to Hicks' autobiography ''[[Guantanamo: My Journey]]'', he was unfamiliar with the name Al-Qaeda until after his detainment in Guantanamo Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh1&quot;/&gt;

===Afghanistan===
Upon arrival in Afghanistan, Hicks allegedly went to an al-Qaeda guest house where he met [[Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi]], a high-ranking al Qaeda member.{{dubious|Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi was a minor rival to al Qaeda|date=February 2015}} He turned over his passport and told them that he would use the alias &quot;Muhammad Dawood&quot; (to protect himself from attack).&lt;ref name=&quot;MCC2004&quot;/&gt;
Hicks allegedly &quot;attended a number of al-Qaeda training courses at various camps around Afghanistan, learning guerrilla warfare, weapons training, including landmines, kidnapping techniques and assassination methods.&quot;&lt;ref name= smh/&gt; He also allegedly participated &quot;in an advanced course on surveillance, in which he conducted surveillance of the abandoned buildings that had formerly been the US and British embassies in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan.&quot; Hicks was sent to learn guerrilla techniques for the Pakistani LoT for use in disputed Kashmir.&lt;ref name= smh/&gt; However, both embassies had closed in 1989 and did not re-open until after Hicks' arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABCAM&quot;/&gt;

He strongly denies that he had any involvement with al-Qaeda, nor that he knew the camp had any al-Qaeda links. According to Hicks, he did not know of the existence of al-Qaeda until he was taken to Cuba and was interrogated by US Military personnel. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;There were three or four camps under the name of Camp Farouk at that time in Afghanistan. I attended the open mainstream camp, not terrorist camps. I would not have been there if there was any suggestion of terrorist activity or the targeting of civilians. How would a white boy new to Islam, not understanding local customs or languages, largely uneducated in the ways of the world, get access to such supposedly secret camps planning acts of terror? The camps I attended were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation until my arrival in Guantanamo Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh1&quot;&gt;{{cite news

On one occasion when al-Qaeda founder [[Osama bin Laden]] visited an Afghan camp, the US Defense Department alleges&lt;ref name= smh/&gt; Hicks questioned bin Laden about the lack of English in training material and subsequently &quot;began to translate the training camp materials from Arabic to English&quot;. Hicks denies this and also denies having had the necessary language proficiency, a claim supported by Major [[Michael Mori]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ABCAM&quot;&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2004/s1129577.htm David Hicks charged] [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Radio]]  11 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and fellow detainee [[Moazzam Begg]].

He later, however, told investigators he had exaggerated, that he had seen bin Laden about eight times and spoken to him only once.

The memoir made a number of claims, including that Hicks was teamed in the training camp with [[Filipino people|Filipino]] recruits from the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] and that, during internment in [[Camp X-Ray]], Hicks allegedly described his desire to &quot;go back to Australia and rob and kill Jews ... crash a plane into a building&quot; and to &quot;go out with that last big adrenaline rush.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

==== September 2001 ====
On 9 September 2001, Hicks travelled from Afghanistan to Pakistan to visit a friend.&lt;ref name =GC/&gt; A [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] statement claimed that &quot;viewing TV news coverage in Pakistan of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]] against the United States&quot; led Hicks to return to Afghanistan to &quot;rejoin his al-Qaeda associates to fight against U.S., British, Canadian, Australian, Afghan, and other coalition forces.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC20051031_4Corners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= smh/&gt; Hicks refutes this claim in his book. Although the LeT offered to provide documentation to allow him to return to Australia, Hicks feared arrest for using false documents.{{citation needed|reason=specific reference|date=May 2011}} Hicks returned in order to get his passport and birth certificate back so he could travel home to Adelaide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC20051031_4Corners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= smh/&gt;

Hicks arrived in the southern Afghan city of [[Kandahar]] where he reported to [[Saif al Adel]], who was assigning individuals to locations, and &quot;armed himself with an [[AK-47]] automatic rifle, ammunition, and grenades to fight against coalition forces.&quot; Hicks was given a choice of three locations and chose to join an alleged group of al-Qaeda fighters defending the Kandahar airport. After Coalition bombing commenced in October 2001, Hicks began guarding a Taliban tank position outside the airport. After guarding the tank for a week, Hicks, with an [[Lashkar-e-Toiba|LET]] acquaintance, travelled closer to the battle front in [[Kunduz]] where he joined others, including [[John Walker Lindh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MCC2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= smh/&gt;

Colonel [[Morris Davis]], chief prosecutor for the US office of Military Commissions, said, &quot;He eventually left Afghanistan and it's my understanding was heading back to Australia when 9/11 happened. When he heard about 9/11, he said it was a good thing (and) he went back to the battlefield, back to Afghanistan, and reported in to the senior leadership of al-Qaeda and basically said, 'I'm David Hicks and I'm reporting for duty.'&quot; Davis also compared Hicks' alleged actions to that of those who carried out terrorist attacks such as Bali, the London and Madrid bombings, and the [[Beslan school siege]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AGE20070111_HicksCase&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In October and November 2001 Hicks wrote multiple letters to his mother, Sue King, back in Australia. He asked that replies were to be directed to Abu Muslim Austraili, a pseudonym he used to circumvent non-Muslim spies he believed intercepted correspondence. In these letters he detailed the validity of [[Jihad]] and his own prospect of &quot;[[Martyrdom in Islam|martyr]]dom&quot;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;As a Muslim young and fit my responsibility is to protect my brothers from aggressive non-believers and not let them destroy it. Islam will rule again but for now we must have patience we are asked to sacrifice our lives for Allahs cause why not? There are many privileges in heaven. It is not just war, it is jihad.

In November 2005, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s ''[[Four Corners (TV program)|Four Corners]]'' TV program broadcast for the first time a transcript of an interview with Hicks, conducted by the [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP) in 2002, and other material, including a report that Hicks had signed a statement written by American military investigators stating that he had trained with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, learning guerrilla tactics and urban warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC20051031_4Corners&quot;/&gt;  The program also reported that Hicks had met Osama bin Laden and that he claimed to have disapproved of the 11 September attacks but to have been unable to leave Afghanistan. He denied engaging in any actual fighting against US or allied forces and states in his autobiography that he was made to sign the aforementioned statement under extreme duress.{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}

* regularly forced to run in leg shackles causing ankle injury
* [[sleep deprivation|deprived of sleep]] &quot;as a matter of policy&quot;

Hicks was charged by a US military commission on 26 August 2004.

In Guantanamo, Hicks had signed a statement written by American military investigators which read, in part, &quot;I believe that al-Qaeda camps provided a great opportunity for Muslims like myself from all over the world to train for military operations and Jihad.

The indictment made the following allegations:

* In November 1999, Hicks travelled to [[Pakistan]], where he joined the paramilitary [[Islamism|Islamist]] group, [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] (Army of the Pure).
* Hicks trained for two months at a Lashkar-e-Toiba camp in Pakistan, where he received weapons training and that, during 2000, he served with a Lashkar-e-Toiba group near the Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
* In January 2001, Hicks travelled to [[Afghanistan]], then under the control of the [[Taliban]] regime, where he presented a letter of introduction from Lashkar-e-Toiba to [[Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi]], a senior [[al-Qaeda]] member, and was given the alias &quot;Mohammed Dawood&quot;.
* Hicks was sent to al-Qaeda's [[Al Farouq training camp|al-Farouq training camp]] outside [[Kandahar]], where he trained for eight weeks, receiving further weapons training as well as training with land mines and explosives.
* Hicks did a further seven-week course at al-Farouq, during which he studied marksmanship, ambush, camouflage and intelligence techniques.
* At [[Osama bin Laden]]'s request, Hicks translated some al-Qaeda training materials from Arabic into English.
* In June 2001, on the instructions of [[Mohammed Atef]], an al-Qaeda military commander, Hicks went to another training camp at [[Tarnak Farm]], where he studied &quot;urban tactics&quot;, including the use of assault and sniper rifles, [[rappelling]], kidnapping and assassination techniques.
* In August 2001, Hicks went to [[Kabul]], where he studied information collection and intelligence, as well as Islamic theology including the doctrines of ''[[jihad]]'' and martyrdom as understood through al-Qaeda's fundamentalist interpretation of Islam.
* In September 2001, Hicks travelled to Pakistan and was there at the time of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]] on the United States, which he saw on television.
* Hicks returned to Afghanistan in anticipation of the attack by the United States and its allies on the Taliban regime, which was sheltering Osama bin Laden.
* On returning to Kabul, Hicks was assigned by Mohammed Atef to the defence of Kandahar and that he joined a group of mixed al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters at [[Kandahar Airfield|Kandahar airport]]. At the end of October, however, Hicks and his party travelled north to join in the fighting against the forces of the US and its allies.
* After arriving in [[Konduz]] on 9 November 2001, he joined a group which included [[John Walker Lindh]] (the &quot;American Taliban&quot;). This group was engaged in combat against Coalition forces and, during the fighting, he was captured by Coalition forces.

On 29 June 2006, the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' that the military commissions were illegal under United States law and the Geneva Conventions. The commission trying Hicks was abolished and the charges against him voided.

In an interview with ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper in January 2007, [[Morris Davis|Col. Morris Davis]], the chief prosecutor in the [[Guantanamo military commissions]], also alleged that Hicks had been issued with weapons to fight US troops, and had conducted surveillance against US and international embassies. Davis stated he would be charged for these offences, and predicted the charging would take place before the end of January. He alleged that Hicks &quot;knew and associated with a number of al-Qaeda senior leadership&quot; and that &quot;he conducted surveillance on the US embassy and other embassies&quot;. He went on to compare Hicks to the [[2002 Bali bombing|Bali bombers]], expressing concern that Australians were misjudging the military commission system due to PR &quot;smoke&quot; from Hicks's lawyer.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheAge2007011_HicksCase&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Hicks's trial was next set for 10 January 2005{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but there were numerous postponements and further legal wrangling over the years that followed. In mid-February 2005, [[Jumana Musa]], [[Amnesty International]]'s legal observer at Guantanamo Bay, visited Australia to speak to the attorney-general, [[Philip Ruddock]], (a member of Amnesty International) about the military commissions. Musa stated that Australia was &quot;the only country that seems to have come out and said that the idea of trying somebody, their own citizen, before this process might be OK, and I think that should be a concern to anybody.&quot;&lt;ref name=AGE20040614_Charges&gt;{{Cite news

2006 was also fraught with delays. On 29 June 2006, in the case ''[[Hamdan v.

On 6 December 2006 Hicks's legal team lodged documents with the [[Federal Court of Australia]], arguing that the Australian government had breached its protective duty to Hicks as an Australian citizen in custody overseas, and failed to request that Hicks's incarceration by the US comply with the [[Geneva Convention]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Hicks applied for citizenship, but there were six months of delays. In November 2005, the British [[Home Office]] rejected Hicks's application for British citizenship on character grounds, but his lawyers appealed the decision. On 13 December 2005 Lord Justice [[Lawrence Collins]] of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled that then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Charles Clarke]] had &quot;no power in law&quot; to deprive Mr Hicks of British citizenship &quot;and so he must be registered&quot;.

===Seizure of legal papers===
Following the [[Guantanamo Bay homicide accusations|death of three detainees]], camp authorities seized prisoners' papers.

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] acknowledged in court that &quot;privileged attorney-client communications&quot; had been seized. Hicks's lawyer questioned whether Hicks could have been part of a suicide plot, since he had spent the preceding four months in solitary confinement in a different part of the camp, and expressed concern that attorney-client confidentiality, &quot;the last legal right that was being respected&quot;, had been violated.&lt;ref name=TheJurist060821&gt;{{cite web

* Around August 2001 Hicks conducted surveillance on the American and British embassies in Kabul.
* Using the name Abu Muslim Austraili he attended al-Qaeda training camps.
* Around April 2001 Hicks returned to al Farouq and trained &quot;in al-Qa'ida's guerilla warfare and mountain tactics training course&quot;. The course included &quot;marksmanship; small team tactics; ambush; camouflage; rendezvous techniques; and techniques to pass intelligence to al-Qa'ida operatives&quot;.
* While at the al Farouq camp, al-Qa'ida leader Osama bin Laden visited the camp on several occasions and &quot;during one visit Hicks expressed to bin Laden his concern over the lack of English al-Qa'ida training material&quot;.
* On or about 12 September 2001 he left Pakistan after watching TV footage of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September terrorist attacks]] to return to Afghanistan &quot;and, again joined with al-Qa'ida&quot;.
* On his return to Afghanistan Hicks was issued an AK-47 automatic rifle and armed himself with 300 rounds of ammunition and 3 grenades to use in fighting the United States, Northern Alliance and other coalition forces.
*On or about 9 November 2001 Hicks spent about two hours on the front line at Konduz &quot;before it collapsed and he was forced to flee&quot;.
*Around December 2001, Northern Alliance forces captured Hicks in Baghlan, Afghanistan.

On 1 March 2007, David Hicks was formally charged with material support for terrorism, and referred to trial by the special military commission.

The agreement also stipulated that the 5 years already spent by Hicks at Guantanamo Bay could not be subtracted from any sentence handed down, that Hicks must not speak to the media for one year nor take legal action against the United States, and that Hicks withdraw allegations that the U.S. military abused him. Accordingly, in the first ever conviction by the Guantanamo military tribunal and the first conviction in a U.S. [[war crimes]] trial since [[World War II]], on 31 March, the tribunal handed down a seven-year jail sentence for the charge, suspending all but 9 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200703/s1886515.htm |title=Hicks shouldn't be a hero: PM |date=31 March 2007 |work=ABC News |publisher=ABC |accessdate=31 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114180720/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200703/s1886515.htm |archivedate=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;news-9months&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Elliott, Geoff |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21454470-601,00.html |title=Hicks home 'in months' |publisher=News Limited |work=The Australian |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Australia's [[Australian anti-terrorism legislation, 2004|proceeds of crime law]] prevents convicted criminals profiting from describing their crimes. At the time of publication, Nikki Christer, a spokesperson for Random House, refused to comment whether Hicks was being paid for the book or whether the publisher or the author are at risk of falling foul of federal proceeds of crime laws. Christer said that Random House's financial arrangements with its authors were confidential.&lt;ref name=ABC2010-09-24&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/24/3021506.htm?section=entertainment |title=Hicks to test law with tell-all memoir |work=ABC News |publisher=ABC |location=Australia |author=Om, Jason |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=24 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] quoted George Williams, a legal expert from the [[University of New South Wales]], who said &quot;You can't proceed unless you actually know that Hicks is profiting.

In 2004, federal proceeds of crime laws were amended to include offences covered by the U.S. military commission, in order to prevent Hicks from profiting. As the military commission that convicted Hicks was found to be invalid, in 2011 the amendment was repealed and the existing federal proceeds of crime legislation no longer applies, although the DPP believes the federal law is still broad enough to cover Hicks. South Australia still has laws preventing Hicks from profiting, but these may not apply in regard to a trial that did not satisfy the principles of natural justice and an attempt to apply them to Hicks could, according to Williams, end up in the High Court as a major constitutional challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2010/s2948520.htm |author=Om, Jason |title=Hicks now free to sell story: Legal expert |work=[[PM (ABC Radio)]] |location=Australia |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2011/s3274991.htm |author=Om, Jason |title=AG says DPP leading case against Hicks |work=[[PM (ABC Radio)]] |location=Australia |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2012, the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that the case against Hicks had been dropped, as documentary evidence such as Hicks' guilty plea and other admissions may not be admissible in court due to the circumstances in which they were obtained. Hicks' legal team argued that they were made under &quot;instances of severe beatings, sleep deprivation and other conditions of detention that contravene international human rights norms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/features/books/jacketcopy/la-jc-australia-drops-case-over-guantanamo-detainees-book-profits-20120724,0,165808.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Carolyn | last=Kellogg | title=Australia drops case over Guantanamo detainee's book profits | date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
