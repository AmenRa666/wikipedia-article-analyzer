In [[monotheism]], '''God''' is conceived of as the [[Supreme Being]] and principal object of [[faith]].&lt;ref name=Swinburne&gt;[[Richard Swinburne|Swinburne, R.G.]] &quot;God&quot; in [[Ted Honderich|Honderich, Ted]]. (ed)''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[conceptions of God|concept of God]] as described by most [[Theology|theologians]] includes the attributes of [[omniscience]] (infinite knowledge), [[omnipotence]] (unlimited power), [[omnipresence]] (present everywhere), [[divine simplicity]], and as having an eternal and necessary existence.  Many theologians also describe God as being [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] (perfectly good), and [[Love of God|all loving]].

God is most often held to be [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] (immaterial),&lt;ref name=&quot;Swinburne&quot; /&gt; and to be without gender,&lt;ref&gt;David Bordwell, 2002, ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'',Continuum International Publishing ISBN 978-0-86012-324-8 page 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM Catechism at the Vatican website]&lt;/ref&gt; yet the concept of God actively creating the universe (as opposed to passively)&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=David|title=Why Matter Matters: Philosophical and Scriptural Reflections on the Sacraments|year=2002|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor|location=Chapter Five: Why Male Priests?|isbn=978-1931709347|first2=Peter |last2=Kreeft}}&lt;/ref&gt; has caused{{Dubious|date=September 2016}} many religions to describe God using masculine terminology, using such terms as &quot;Him&quot; or &quot;Father&quot;. Furthermore, some religions (such as [[Judaism]]) attribute only a purely grammatical [[Gender of God|&quot;gender&quot; to God]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;G-d has no body, no genitalia, therefore the very idea that G-d is male or female is patently absurd. Although in the Talmudic part of the Torah and especially in Kabalah G-d is referred to under the name '[[Shekhinah|Sh'chinah]]' - which is feminine, this is only to accentuate the fact that all the creation and nature are actually in the receiving end in reference to the creator and as no part of the creation can perceive the creator outside of nature, it is adequate to refer to the divine presence in feminine form. We refer to G-d using masculine terms simply for convenience's sake, because Hebrew has no neutral gender; G-d is no more male than a table is.&quot; [http://www.jewfaq.org/g-d.htm Judaism 101]. &quot;The fact that we always refer to God as 'He' is also not meant to imply that the concept of sex or gender applies to God.&quot; Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, ''The Aryeh Kaplan Reader'', Mesorah Publications (1983), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporeity and corporeity of God are related to conceptions of [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] (being outside nature) and [[immanence]] (being in nature, in the world) of God, with positions of synthesis such as the &quot;[[immanent transcendence]]&quot; of [[Chinese theology]].

God has been conceived as either [[personal god|personal]] or impersonal. In [[theism]], God is the [[creator deity|creator]] and [[God the Sustainer|sustainer]] of the [[universe]], while in [[deism]], God is the creator, but not the sustainer, of the universe. In [[pantheism]], God is the universe itself. In [[atheism]], God is not believed to exist, while God is deemed unknown or unknowable within the context of [[agnosticism]]. God has also been conceived as the source of all [[moral obligation]], and the &quot;greatest conceivable existent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swinburne&quot; /&gt; Many notable philosophers  have developed arguments for and against the [[existence of God]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Platinga&quot; /&gt;

There are many [[Names of God|names for God]], and different names are attached to different cultural ideas about God's identity and attributes. In the ancient Egyptian era of [[Atenism]], possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called [[Aten]],&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press 2005, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; premised on being the one &quot;true&quot; Supreme Being and creator of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', Vol.2, 1980, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[Judaism]], &quot;He Who Is&quot;, &quot;[[I Am that I Am]]&quot;, and the [[tetragrammaton]] YHWH ({{Lang-he|יהוה}}, which means: &quot;I am who I am&quot;; &quot;He Who Exists&quot;) are used as names of God, while [[Yahweh]] and [[Jehovah]] are sometimes used in Christianity as vocalizations of YHWH. In the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, God, consubstantial in three persons, is called the [[God the Father|Father]], the [[God the Son|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]. In Judaism, it is common to refer to God by the titular [[Names of God in Judaism|names]] [[Elohim]] or [[Adonai]], the latter of which is believed by some scholars to descend from the Egyptian Aten.&lt;ref name=&quot;freud&quot;&gt;Freud, S. (1939). Moses and Monotheism: Three Essays.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunther Siegmund Stent, ''Paradoxes of Free Will''. [[American Philosophical Society]], DIANE, 2002. 284 pages. Pages 34 - 38.

The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 36, No. 2 (May, 1973), pp. 48-76. doi 10.2307/3211050&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], the name [[Allah]], &quot;Al-El&quot;, or &quot;Al-Elah&quot; (&quot;the God&quot;) is used, while Muslims also have a [[Names of God in Islam|multitude of titular names]] for God. In [[Hinduism]], [[Brahman]] is often considered a [[Monism|monistic]] concept of God.&lt;ref&gt;Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity - Page 136, Michael P. Levine - 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Chinese religion]], God is conceived as the [[progenitor]] (first ancestor) of the universe, intrinsic to it and constantly [[cosmos|ordaining]] it. Other religions have names for God, for instance, [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|Baha]] in the [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref&gt;A Feast for the Soul: Meditations on the Attributes of God : ... - Page x, Baháʾuʾlláh, Joyce Watanabe - 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waheguru]] in [[Sikhism]],&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy and Faith of Sikhism - Page ix, Kartar Singh Duggal - 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Intellectual Devotional: Revive Your Mind, Complete Your Education, and Roam confidently with the cultured class, David S. Kidder, Noah D. Oppenheim, page 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The many different conceptions of God, and competing claims as to God's characteristics, aims, and actions, have led to the development of ideas of [[omnitheism]], [[pandeism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lataster&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[perennial philosophy]], which postulates that there is one underlying theological truth, of which all religions express a partial understanding, and as to which &quot;the devout in the various great world religions are in fact worshipping that one God, but through different, overlapping concepts or mental images of Him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Christianity and Other Religions'', by John Hick and Brian Hebblethwaite. 1980.

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:Louvre 042010 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Mesha Stele]] bears the earliest known reference (840&amp;nbsp;BCE) to the Israelite God Yahweh.]]

{{Main article|God (word)}}
The earliest written form of the Germanic word ''God'' (always, in this usage, [[capitalization in English|capitalized]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/god|title='God' in Merriam-Webster (online)|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) comes from the 6th-century [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Codex Argenteus]]. The English word itself is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] * ǥuđan. The reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] form {{PIE|* ǵhu-tó-m}} was likely based on the root {{PIE|* ǵhau(ə)-}}, which meant either &quot;to call&quot; or &quot;to invoke&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The ulterior etymology is disputed. Apart from the unlikely hypothesis of adoption from a foreign tongue, the OTeut. &quot;ghuba&quot; implies as its preTeut-type either &quot;*ghodho-m&quot; or &quot;*ghodto-m&quot;. The former does not appear to admit of explanation; but the latter would represent the neut. pple. of a root &quot;gheu-&quot;. There are two Aryan roots of the required form (&quot;*g,heu-&quot; with palatal aspirate) one with meaning 'to invoke' (Skr. &quot;hu&quot;) the other 'to pour, to offer sacrifice' (Skr &quot;hu&quot;, Gr. χεηi;ν, OE &quot;geotàn&quot; Yete v). [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED Compact Edition, G, p. 267]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic words for ''God'' were originally [[Grammatical gender|neuter]]—applying to both genders—but during the process of the [[Christianization]] of the [[Germanic people]]s from their indigenous [[Germanic paganism]], the words became a [[Grammatical gender|masculine syntactic form]].&lt;ref name=BARNHART323&gt;Barnhart, Robert K (1995). ''The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology: the Origins of American English Words'', page 323. [[HarperCollins]]. ISBN 0-06-270084-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allah3.svg|thumb|right|The word 'Allah' in [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]]]]

In the [[English language]], the capitalized form of ''God'' continues to represent a distinction between monotheistic &quot;God&quot; and &quot;gods&quot; in [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]; &quot;God n. ME &lt; OE, akin to Ger gott, Goth guth, prob. &lt; IE base * ĝhau-, to call out to, invoke &gt; Sans havaté, (he) calls upon; 1. any of various beings conceived of as supernatural, immortal, and having special powers over the lives and affairs of people and the course of nature; deity, esp. a male deity: typically considered objects of worship; 2. an image that is worshiped; idol 3. a person or thing deified or excessively honored and admired; 4. [G-] in monotheistic religions, the creator and ruler of the universe, regarded as eternal, infinite, all-powerful, and all-knowing; [[Supreme Being]]; the Almighty&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/God Dictionary.com]; &quot;God /gɒd/ noun: 1. the one Supreme Being, the creator and ruler of the universe. 2. the Supreme Being considered with reference to a particular attribute. 3. (lowercase) one of several deities, esp. a male deity, presiding over some portion of worldly affairs. 4. (often lowercase) a supreme being according to some particular conception: the God of mercy. 5. Christian Science. the Supreme Being, understood as Life, Truth, Love, Mind, Soul, Spirit, Principle. 6. (lowercase) an image of a deity; an idol. 7. (lowercase) any deified person or object. 8. (often lowercase) Gods, Theater. 8a. the upper balcony in a theater. 8b. the spectators in this part of the balcony.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The English word ''God'' and its counterparts in other languages are normally used for any and all conceptions and, in spite of significant differences between religions, the term remains an English translation common to all. The same holds for Hebrew ''[[El (god)|El]]'', but [[names of God in Judaism|in Judaism]], God is also given a proper name, the [[tetragrammaton]] YHWH, in origin possibly the name of an [[Edomite]] or [[Midianite]] deity, [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]].
In many translations of the [[Bible]], when the word ''LORD'' is in all capitals, it signifies that the word represents the tetragrammaton.&lt;ref name=Barton2006&gt;{{cite book

''[[Allāh]]'' ({{lang-ar|الله}}) is the [[Arabic]] term with no [[plural]] used by Muslims and Arabic speaking Christians and Jews meaning &quot;The God&quot; (with a capital G), while &quot;[[ʾilāh]]&quot; ({{lang-ar|'''إله'''}}) is the term used for a deity or a god in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/empires/islam/faithgod.html |title=God |work=Islam: Empire of Faith |publisher=PBS|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Islam and Christianity&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Christianity'' (2001): Arabic-speaking [[Christian]]s and [[Jew]]s also refer to God as ''Allāh''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title=Allah | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet}}&lt;/ref&gt; God may also be given a proper name in monotheistic currents of Hinduism which emphasize the [[personal god|personal nature of God]], with early references to his name as [[Krishna]]-[[Vasudeva]] in [[Bhagavata]] or later [[Vishnu]] and [[Hari]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hastings541&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hastings|2003|p=540|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kaz58z--NtUC&amp;pg=PA540&amp;vq=Krishna&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=lo3NqA31k8hJZw7qNc9QDEAYyYA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahura Mazda is the name for God used in Zoroastrianism. &quot;Mazda&quot;, or rather the Avestan stem-form ''Mazdā-'', nominative ''Mazdå'', reflects Proto-Iranian ''*Mazdāh (female)''. It is generally taken to be the proper name of the spirit, and like its [[Sanskrit]] cognate ''medhā'', means &quot;[[intelligence]]&quot; or &quot;[[wisdom]]&quot;. Both the Avestan and Sanskrit words reflect [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''*mazdhā-'', from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] mn̩sdʰeh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', literally meaning &quot;placing (''dʰeh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'') one's mind (''*mn̩-s'')&quot;, hence &quot;wise&quot;.{{Sfn|Boyce|1983|p=685}}

Waheguru ({{lang-pa|''{{IAST|vāhigurū}}''}}) is a term most often used in [[Sikhism]] to refer to God. It means &quot;Wonderful Teacher&quot; in the Punjabi language. ''Vāhi'' (a Middle Persian borrowing) means &quot;wonderful&quot; and ''[[guru]]'' ({{lang-sa|''{{IAST|guru}}''}}) is a term denoting &quot;teacher&quot;. Waheguru is also described by some as an experience of ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions. The most common usage of the word &quot;Waheguru&quot; is in the greeting Sikhs use with each other:
: ''Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh''
: Wonderful Lord's [[Khalsa]], Victory is to the Wonderful Lord.
''Baha'', the &quot;greatest&quot; name for God in the Baha'i faith, is Arabic for &quot;All-Glorious&quot;.

==General conceptions==
{{Main article|Conceptions of God}}

There is no clear consensus on the nature or even the [[existence of God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Froese|first=Paul|author2=Christopher Bader|title=Does God Matter? A Social-Science Critique|journal=Harvard Divinity Bulletin|date=Fall–Winter 2004|volume=32|series=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abrahamic conceptions of God]] include the [[monotheistic]] definition of God in [[Judaism]], the [[trinity|trinitarian]] view of [[Christians]], and the [[Islamic concept of God]].
The [[dharmic religions]] differ in their view of the divine: views of [[God in Hinduism]] vary by region, sect, and caste, ranging from monotheistic to polytheistic. Divinity was [[God in Buddhism|recognized]] by the historical Buddha, particularly [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] and [[Brahma (Buddhism)|Brahma]]. However, other sentient beings, including gods, can at best only play a supportive role in one's personal path to salvation. Conceptions of God in the latter developments of the [[Mahayana]] tradition give a more prominent place to notions of the divine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Oneness===
{{Main article|Monotheism|Henotheism}}
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|The Trinity is the belief that God is composed of [[God the Father|The Father]],  [[God the Son|The Son]] (embodied metaphysically in the physical realm by [[Jesus]]), and [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|The Holy Spirit]].]]

[[Monotheism|Monotheists]] hold that there is only one god, and may claim that the one true god is worshiped in different religions under different names. The view that all theists actually worship the same god, whether they know it or not, is especially emphasized in [[Hinduism]]&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Bhaskarananda, ''Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 2002) ISBN 1-884852-04-1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1350&amp;english=t&amp;id=57718 |title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib |publisher=Sri Granth |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Christianity]], the [[doctrine of the Trinity]] describes God as one God in three persons.

God is described in the [[Quran]] as: &quot;Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|112|1|end=4|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title=Allah, Tawhid | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online | author=D. Gimaret}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the [[Trinity]] and the divinity of [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]], comparing it to [[polytheism]]. In Islam, God is beyond all comprehension or equal and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. Thus, [[Muslim]]s are not [[iconodules]], and are not expected to visualize God.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. [[Open Theism]], by contrast, asserts that, due to the nature of time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future.

===Other concepts===

[[Dystheism]], which is related to [[theodicy]], is a form of theism which holds that God is either not wholly good or is fully malevolent as a consequence of the [[problem of evil]]. One such example comes from [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', in which Ivan Karamazov rejects God on the grounds that he allows children to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28054/28054-h/28054-h.html The Project Gutenberg EBook of ''The Brothers Karamazov'' by Fyodor Dostoyevsky] pp259-261&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, some more abstract concepts have been developed, such as [[process theology]] and [[open theism]]. The contemporaneous French philosopher [[Michel Henry]] has however proposed a [[Phenomenological definition of God|phenomenological approach and definition of God]] as [[Phenomenology (religion)|phenomenological]] essence of [[Phenomenological life|Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henry|first=Michel|title=I am the Truth. Toward a philosophy of Christianity|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8047-3780-0|others=Translated by Susan Emanuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

God has also been conceived as being [[Incorporeality|incorporeal]] (immaterial), a [[personal god|personal]] being, the source of all [[moral obligation]], and the &quot;greatest conceivable existent&quot;.&lt;ref name=Swinburne/&gt; These attributes were all supported to varying degrees by the early [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] theologian philosophers, including [[Maimonides]],&lt;ref name=Edwards /&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot;&gt;[[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. &quot;God and the philosophers&quot; in [[Ted Honderich|Honderich, Ted]]. (ed)''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1995. ISBN 978-1-61592-446-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al-Ghazali]],&lt;ref name=Platinga&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga|Platinga, Alvin]]. &quot;God, Arguments for the Existence of&quot;, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

==Non-theistic views==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
[[Nontheism|Non-theist]] views about God also vary. Some non-theists avoid the concept of God, whilst accepting that it is significant to many; other non-theists understand God as a symbol of human values and aspirations. The nineteenth-century English [[atheism|atheist]] [[Charles Bradlaugh]] declared that he refused to say &quot;There is no God&quot;, because &quot;the word 'God' is to me a sound conveying no clear or distinct affirmation&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Plea for Atheism. By 'Iconoclast{{'&quot;}}, London, Austin &amp; Co., 1876, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; he said more specifically that he disbelieved in the Christian god. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] proposed an approach dividing the world of philosophy into what he called &quot;[[non-overlapping magisteria]]&quot; (NOMA). In this view, questions of the [[supernatural]], such as those relating to the [[existence]] and [[nature]] of God, are [[metaphysics|non]]-[[empirical]] and are the proper domain of [[theology]]. The methods of science should then be used to answer any empirical question about the natural world, and theology should be used to answer questions about ultimate meaning and moral value. In this view, the perceived lack of any empirical footprint from the magisterium of the supernatural onto natural events makes science the sole player in the natural world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins-Delusion&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The God Delusion |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |year=2006 |publisher=Bantam Press |location=Great Britain |isbn=0-618-68000-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view, advanced by [[Richard Dawkins]], is that the existence of God is an empirical question, on the grounds that &quot;a universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without, and it would be a scientific difference.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins&quot;&gt;{{cite news

[[Stephen Hawking]] and co-author [[Leonard Mlodinow]] state in their book, ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]'', that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=172|title=The Grand Design|author=Stephen Hawking|author2=Leonard Mlodinow|publisher=Bantam Books|year=2010|isbn=978-0-553-80537-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientist Michael Nikoletseas has proposed that questions of the existence of God are no different from questions of natural sciences. Following a biological comparative approach, he concludes that it is highly probable that God exists, and, although not visible, it is possible that we know some of his attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Nikoletseas, Michael M.

===Agnosticism and atheism===
Agnosticism is the view that, the [[truth value]]s of certain claims –&amp;nbsp;especially [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and religious claims such as [[Existence of God|whether God]], the [[Divinity|divine]] or the [[supernatural]] exist&amp;nbsp;– are unknown and perhaps&lt;!--probably?--&gt; unknowable.&lt;!--

Atheism is, in a broad sense, the rejection of [[belief]] in the existence of [[Deity|deities]], or a God.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen 2013: &quot;Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons ... : for an anthropomorphic God, the atheist rejects belief in God because it is false or probably false that there is a God; for a nonanthropomorphic God ... because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers ... because the concept of God in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance—e.g., &quot;God&quot; is just another name for love, or ... a symbolic term for moral ideals.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2005: &quot;On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe 1998: &quot;As commonly understood, atheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of God. So an atheist is someone who disbelieves in God, whereas a theist is someone who believes in God. Another meaning of 'atheism' is simply nonbelief in the existence of God, rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of God. ... an atheist, in the broader sense of the term, is someone who disbelieves in every form of deity, not just the God of traditional Western theology.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropomorphism===
{{Main article|Anthropomorphism}}
[[Pascal Boyer]] argues that while there is a wide array of supernatural concepts found around the world, in general, supernatural beings tend to behave much like people. The construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion. He cites examples from [[Greek mythology]], which is, in his opinion, more like a modern [[soap opera]] than other religious systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyer&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] Stewart Guthrie contends that people project human features onto non-human aspects of the world because it makes those aspects more familiar. [[Sigmund Freud]] also suggested that god concepts are projections of one's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Barrett-Conceptualizing-a-Nonnatural-Entity.pdf

Likewise, [[Émile Durkheim]] was one of the earliest to suggest that gods represent an extension of human social life to include supernatural beings. In line with this reasoning, psychologist Matt Rossano contends that when humans began living in larger groups, they may have created gods as a means of enforcing morality. In small groups, morality can be enforced by social forces such as gossip or reputation. However, it is much harder to enforce morality using social forces in much larger groups. Rossano indicates that by including ever-watchful gods and spirits, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;supernature&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Arguments about the existence of God typically include empirical, deductive, and inductive types. Different views include that: &quot;God does not exist&quot; ([[Weak and strong atheism|strong atheism]]); &quot;God almost certainly does not exist&quot; (''de facto'' [[atheism]]); &quot;no one knows whether God exists&quot; ([[agnosticism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Henry Huxley]], an English biologist, was the first to come up with the word ''agnostic'' in 1869 {{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2008 |location=Oxford |page=63 |isbn=978-0-19-929551-7}} However, earlier authors and published works have promoted an agnostic points of view. They include [[Protagoras]], a 5th-century [[Before Common Era|BCE]] Greek philosopher. {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/protagor.htm|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Protagoras (c. 490 - c. 420 BCE)|accessdate=2008-10-06|quote=While the pious might wish to look to the gods to provide absolute moral guidance in the relativistic universe of the Sophistic Enlightenment, that certainty also was cast into doubt by philosophic and sophistic thinkers, who pointed out the absurdity and immorality of the conventional epic accounts of the gods.

Many things prevent knowledge including the obscurity of the subject and the brevity of human life.'|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014181706/http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/protagor.htm|archivedate=2008-10-14 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;);&quot;God exists, but this cannot be proven or disproven&quot; (''de facto'' [[theism]]); and that &quot;God exists and this can be proven&quot; ([[theism|strong theism]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins-Delusion&quot; /&gt;

Countless arguments have been proposed to prove the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Kreeft|editor-first=Peter|title=Summa of the Summa|year=1990|publisher=Ignatius Press |page=63 |first=Thomas |last=Aquinas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most notable arguments are the [[Quinque viae|Five Ways of Aquinas]], the [[Argument from Desire]] proposed by [[C.S. Lewis]], and the [[Ontological Argument]] formulated both by [[St. Anselm]] and [[Descartes|René Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Kreeft|editor-first=Peter |title=Summa of the Summa|year=1990|publisher=Ignatius Press |pages=65–69 |first=Thomas |last=Aquinas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Anselm's approach was to define God as, &quot;that than which nothing greater can be conceived&quot;. Famed pantheist philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] would later carry this idea to its extreme: &quot;By God I understand a being absolutely infinite, i.e., a substance consisting of infinite attributes, of which each one expresses an eternal and infinite essence.&quot; For Spinoza, the whole of the natural universe is made of one substance, God, or its equivalent, Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Curley|first=Edwin M.|year=1985|title=The Collected Works of Spinoza|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-07222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His proof for the existence of God was a variation of the Ontological argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2012/entries/spinoza/ |title=Baruch Spinoza|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scientist]] [[Isaac Newton]] saw God as the masterful creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, R.K. ed. Knud Haakonssen. &quot;The emergence of Rational Dissent.&quot; Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in eighteenth-century Britain. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1996. p19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, he rejected polymath [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]' thesis that God would necessarily make a perfect world which requires no intervention from the creator. In Query 31 of the ''Opticks'', Newton simultaneously made an argument from design and for the necessity of intervention:{{quote| For while comets move in very eccentric orbs in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make all the planets move one and the same way in orbs concentric, some inconsiderable irregularities excepted which may have arisen from the mutual actions of comets and planets on one another, and which will be apt to increase, till this system wants a reformation.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, 1706 ''Opticks'' (2nd Edition), quoted in H. G. Alexander 1956 (ed): ''The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'', University of Manchester Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}St. Thomas believed that the [[existence of God]] is self-evident in itself, but not to us. &quot;Therefore I say that this proposition, &quot;God exists&quot;, of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject.... Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature—namely, by effects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article1&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Thomas believed that the existence of God can be demonstrated. Briefly in the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' and more extensively in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).{{Hatnote|For the original text of the five proofs, see [[quinque viae]]}}

# Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a [[Unmoved mover|First Mover]] not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.
# Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a [[Prima causa|First Cause]], called God.
# Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.
# Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. This then, we call God (Note: Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself).
# Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws. Anything without awareness tends to a goal under the guidance of one who is aware. This we call God (Note that even when we guide objects, in Thomas's view, the source of all our knowledge comes from God as well).&lt;ref&gt;Summa of Theology I, q.2, The Five Ways Philosophers Have Proven God's Existence&lt;/ref&gt;

Some findings in the fields of [[cosmology]], [[evolutionary biology]] and [[neuroscience]] are interpreted by some atheists (including [[Lawrence M.

Neuroscientist Michael Nikoletseas has proposed that questions of the existence of God are no different from questions of natural sciences. Following a biological comparative approach, he concludes that it is highly probable that God exists, and, although not visible, it is possible that we know some of his attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;

==Specific attributes==
Different religious traditions assign differing (though often similar) attributes and characteristics to God, including expansive powers and abilities, psychological characteristics, gender characteristics, and preferred nomenclature. The assignment of these attributes often differs according to the [[conceptions of God]] in the culture from which they arise. For example, [[attributes of God in Christianity]], attributes of [[God in Islam]], and [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy|the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy in Judaism]] share certain similarities arising from their common roots.

===Names===
{{Main article| Names of God}}
[[File:Allah Names in Chinese Arabic Script.jpg|thumb|99 names of [[Allah]], in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Sini (script)]]|400x400px]]
The word ''God'' is &quot;one of the most complex and difficult in the English language.&quot; In the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, &quot;the Bible has been the principal source of the conceptions of God&quot;. That the Bible &quot;includes many different images, concepts, and ways of thinking about&quot; God has resulted in perpetual &quot;disagreements about how God is to be conceived and understood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Schüssler Fiorenza and Gordon D. Kaufman, &quot;God&quot;, Ch 6, in Mark C. Taylor, ed, ''Critical Terms for Religious Studies'' (University of Chicago, 1998/2008), 136-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Hebrew and Christian Bibles there are many names for God. One of them is Elohim. Another one is ''El Shaddai'', meaning &quot;God Almighty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. 17:1; 28:3; 35:11; Ex. 6:31; Ps. 91:1, 2&lt;/ref&gt; A third notable name is ''El Elyon'', which means &quot;The Most High God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. 14:19; Ps. 9:2; Dan. 7:18, 22, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

God is described and referred in the [[Quran]] and [[hadith]] by certain names or attributes, the most common being ''[[R-Ḥ-M|Al-Rahman]]'', meaning &quot;Most Compassionate&quot; and ''Al-Rahim'', meaning &quot;Most Merciful&quot; (See [[Names of God in Islam]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bentley |first=David |title=The 99 Beautiful Names for God for All the People of the Book |publisher=William Carey Library |date=September 1999 |isbn=0-87808-299-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Das Bild der Höchsten Seele als Lichtpunkt TR.jpg|thumb|Supreme soul]]The [[Brahma Kumaris]] use the term &quot;Supreme Soul&quot; to refer to God. They see God as incorporeal and eternal, and regard him as a point of living light like human souls, but without a physical body, as he does not enter the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. God is seen as the perfect and constant embodiment of all virtues, powers and values and that He is the unconditionally loving Father of all souls, irrespective of their religion, gender, or culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramsay_Custodians of Purity4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Tamasin|date=Sep 2010|title=Custodians of Purity An Ethnography of the Brahma Kumaris|journal=Monash University|issue=|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaishnavism]], a tradition in Hinduism, has [[list of titles and names of Krishna]].

===Gender===
{{Main article|Gender of God}}
The gender of God may be viewed as either a literal or an [[allegory|allegorical]] aspect of a [[deity]] who, in classical western philosophy, transcends bodily form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Summa Theologica|year=1274|location=Part 1, Question 3, Article 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Augustine of Hippo|title=Confessions|year=397|location=Book 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polytheistic]] religions commonly attribute to each of ''the gods'' a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most [[monotheistic]] religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the [[gender]] of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an [[analogical]] statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;

Biblical sources usually refer to God using male words, except  {{Bibleverse|Genesis||1:26-27|KJV}},&lt;ref&gt;Elaine H.

===Relationship with creation===
{{See also|Creator deity|Prayer|Worship}}
[[File:William Blake 008.jpg|thumb|''And Elohim Created Adam'' by [[William Blake]], c.1795]]
[[Prayer]] plays a significant role among many believers. Muslims believe that the [[purpose of life|purpose of existence]] is to [[worship]] God.&lt;ref name=&quot;patheos1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Islam/Beliefs/Human-Nature-and-the-Purpose-of-Existence.html|title=Human Nature and the Purpose of Existence|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|51|56|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is viewed as a personal God and there are no intermediaries, such as [[clergy]], to contact God. Prayer often also includes [[supplication]] and [[Forgiveness#Religious views|asking forgiveness]]. God is often believed to be forgiving. For example, a [[hadith]] states God would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.islamtoday.net/artshow-426-3787.htm|title=Allah would replace you with a people who sin|publisher=islamtoday.net|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian theologian [[Alister McGrath]] writes that there are good reasons to suggest that a &quot;personal god&quot; is integral to the Christian outlook, but that one has to understand it is an analogy. &quot;To say that God is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others. This does not imply that God is human, or located at a specific point in the universe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Alister|last=McGrath|authorlink=Alister McGrath|title=Christian Theology: An Introduction|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1-4051-5360-1|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of different religions generally disagree as to how to best [[worship]] God and what is [[divine providence|God's plan]] for mankind, if there is one. There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the [[chosen people]] or have exclusive access to [[absolute truth]], generally through [[revelation]] or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is [[religious pluralism]]. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is [[supersessionism]], i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is [[inclusivism|relativistic inclusivism]], where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being [[universalism]]: the doctrine that [[salvation]] is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is [[syncretic|syncretism]], mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the [[New Age]] movement.

Jews and Christians believe that humans are created in the likeness of God, and are the center, crown and key to God's creation, [[Stewardship (theology)|stewards]] for God, supreme over everything else God had made ({{Bibleref2|Gen|1:26|NRSV}}); for this reason, humans are in Christianity called the &quot;Children of God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/encyclopedias/isbe/sons-of-god-new-testament.html|title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Sons of God (New Testament)|work=BibleStudyTools.com|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction==
God is defined as incorporeal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Swinburne&quot; /&gt; and invisible from direct sight, and thus cannot be portrayed in a literal visual image.

The respective principles of religions may or may not permit them to use images (which are entirely symbolic) to represent God in art or in worship .

===Zoroastrianism===
[[File:Naqsh_i_Rustam._Investiture_d'Ardashir_1.jpg|thumb|Ahura Mazda (depiction is on the right, with high crown) presents [[Ardashir I]] (left) with the ring of kingship. (Relief at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], 3rd century CE)]]
During the early Parthian Empire, Ahura Mazda was visually represented for worship. This practice ended during the beginning of the Sassanid empire. Zoroastrian [[iconoclasm]], which can be traced to the end of the Parthian period and the beginning of the Sassanid, eventually put an end to the use of all images of Ahura Mazda in worship. However, Ahura Mazda continued to be symbolized by a dignified male figure, standing or on horseback which is found in Sassanian investiture.{{Sfn|Boyce|1983|p=686}}

===Islam===
{{Further|God in Islam}}
Muslims believe that God (Allah) is beyond all comprehension or equal and does not resemble any of His creations in any way. Thus, [[Muslim]]s are not [[iconodules]], are not expected to visualize God.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

===Judaism===
At least some Jews do not use any image for God, since God is the unimageable Being who cannot be represented in material forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Moses-Hebrew-prophet|title=Moses - Hebrew prophet|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some samples of Jewish Art, however, sometimes God, or at least His Intervention, is indicated by a Hand Of God symbol, which represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally &quot;daughter of a voice&quot;) or Voice of God;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;A matter disputed by some scholars&lt;/ref&gt; this use of the Hand Of God is carried over to Christian Art.

===Christianity===
{{overly-detailed|section|date=April 2016}}
Early Christians believed that the words of the [[Gospel of John]] 1:18: &quot;No man has seen God at any time&quot;  and numerous other statements were meant to apply not only to God, but to all attempts at the depiction of God.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Cornwell page 24&quot;&gt;James Cornwell, 2009 ''Saints, Signs, and Symbols: The Symbolic Language of Christian Art'' ISBN 0-8192-2345-X page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Enluminure_Drogon_c.jpg|thumb|Use of the symbolic [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] in the [[Ascension of Christ|Ascension]] from the [[Drogo Sacramentary]], c. 850]]
However, later on the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] symbol is found several times in the only ancient [[synagogue]] with a large surviving decorative scheme, the [[Dura Europos Synagogue]] of the mid-3rd century, and was probably adopted into [[Early Christian art]] from [[Jewish art]]. It was common in [[Late Antique]] art in both East and West, and remained the main way of symbolizing the actions or approval of God the Father in the West until about the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]]. It also represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally &quot;daughter of a voice&quot;) or voice of God,&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; just like in Jewish Art.

In situations, such as the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]], where a specific representation of God the Father was indicated, the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] was used, with increasing freedom from the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]] until the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].  This motif now, since the discovery of the 3rd century [[Dura Europos synagogue]], seems to have been borrowed from [[Jewish art]], and is found in Christian art almost from its beginnings.

The use of religious images in general continued to increase up to the end of the 7th century, to the point that in 695, upon assuming the throne, [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian II]] put an image of Christ on the obverse side of his gold coins, resulting in a rift which ended the use of [[Byzantine]] coin types in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, 1985 ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', ISBN 0-540-01085-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increase in religious imagery did not include depictions of God the Father. For instance, while the eighty second canon of the [[Council of Trullo]] in 692 did not specifically condemn images of The Father, it suggested that icons of [[Christ]] were preferred over Old Testament shadows and figures.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' ISBN 1-879038-15-3 page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the 8th century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] (literally ''image-breaking'') started. Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (717–741), suppressed the use of icons by [[Emperor|imperial]] [[edict]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably due to a military loss which he attributed to the undue veneration of icons.&lt;ref&gt;According to accounts by Patriarch Nikephoros and the chronicler Theophanes&lt;/ref&gt; The edict (which was issued without consulting the Church) forbade the veneration of religious images but did not apply to other forms of art, including the image of the emperor, or religious symbols such as the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Treadgold, A History of the Byzantine State and Society, Stanford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Theological arguments against icons then began to appear with [[Iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] arguing that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of Jesus at the same time. In this atmosphere, no public depictions of God the Father were even attempted and such depictions only began to appear two centuries later.

The [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 effectively ended the first period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] and restored the honouring of icons and holy images in general.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, 1995 ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' ISBN 0-679-60148-1 page 1693&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of God the Father. Even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th century, such as Saint [[John of Damascus]], drew a distinction between images of God the Father and those of Christ.

In his treatise ''On the Divine Images'' John of Damascus wrote: &quot;In former times, God who is without form or body, could never be depicted. But now when God is seen in the flesh conversing with men, I make an image of the God whom I see&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;St. John of Damascus, ''Three Treatises on the Divine Images'' ISBN 0-88141-245-7&lt;/ref&gt; The implication here is that insofar as God the Father or the Spirit did not become man, visible and tangible, images and portrait icons can not be depicted. So what was true for the whole [[Trinity]] before Christ remains true for the Father and the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] but not for the Word. John of Damascus wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' ISBN 1-879038-15-3 page 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;If we attempt to make an image of the invisible God, this would be sinful indeed. It is impossible to portray one who is without body:invisible, uncircumscribed and without form.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Around 790 [[Charlemagne]] ordered a set of four books that became known as the [[Libri Carolini]] (i.e. &quot;Charles' books&quot;) to refute what his court mistakenly understood to be the iconoclast decrees of the Byzantine [[Second Council of Nicaea]] regarding sacred images. Although not well known during the Middle Ages, these books describe the key elements of the Catholic theological position on sacred images. To the [[Western Church]], images were just objects made by craftsmen, to be utilized for stimulating the senses of the faithful, and to be respected for the sake of the subject represented, not in themselves.

The [[Council of Constantinople (869)]] (considered ecumenical by the Western Church, but not the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]]) reaffirmed the decisions of the Second Council of Nicaea and helped stamp out any remaining coals of [[iconoclasm]]. Specifically, its third canon required the image of Christ to have veneration equal with that of a Gospel book:&lt;ref&gt;Gesa Elsbeth Thiessen, 2005 ''Theological aesthetics'' ISBN 0-8028-2888-4 page 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
We decree that the sacred image of our Lord Jesus Christ, the liberator and Savior of all people, must be venerated with the same honor as is given the book of the holy Gospels. For as through the language of the words contained in this book all can reach salvation, so, due to the action which these images exercise by their colors, all wise and simple alike, can derive profit from them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;But images of God the Father were not directly addressed in Constantinople in 869. A list of permitted icons was enumerated at this Council, but symbols of God the Father were not among them.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' ISBN 1-879038-15-3 page 41&lt;/ref&gt; However, the general acceptance of icons and holy images began to create an atmosphere in which God the Father could be symbolized.

Prior to the 10th century no attempt was made to use a human to symbolize [[God the Father]] in [[Western art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;James Cornwell page 24&quot; /&gt; Yet, Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the Father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th century AD. A rationale for the use of a human is the belief that God created the soul of Man in the image of His own (thus allowing Human to transcend the other animals).

It appears that when early artists designed to represent God the Father, fear and awe restrained them from a usage of the whole human figure. Typically only a small part would be used as the image, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely a whole human.  In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adolphe Napoléon Didron pages 169&quot;&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages'' ISBN 0-7661-4075-X pages 169&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century depictions of God the Father had started to appear in French [[illuminated manuscript]]s, which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography, and in [[stained glass]] church windows in England. Initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space, where the Hand of God had formerly appeared; the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] on the famous [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|baptismal font in Liège]] of [[Rainer of Huy]] is an example from 1118 (a Hand of God is used in another scene).  Gradually the amount of the human symbol shown can increase to a half-length figure, then a full-length, usually enthroned, as in [[Giotto]]'s [[fresco]] of c. 1305 in [[Padua]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Arena Chapel]], at the top of the triumphal arch, ''God sending out the angel of the Annunciation''. See Schiller, I, fig 15&lt;/ref&gt;   In the 14th century the [[Naples Bible]] carried a depiction of God the Father in the [[Burning bush]]. By the early 15th century, the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] has a considerable number of symbols, including an elderly but tall and elegant full-length figure walking in the [[Garden of Eden]], which show a considerable diversity of apparent ages and dress.  The [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)#Lorenzo Ghiberti|&quot;Gates of Paradise&quot; of the Florence Baptistry]] by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], begun in 1425 use a similar tall full-length symbol for the Father.  The [[Rohan Book of Hours]] of about 1430 also included depictions of God the Father in half-length human form, which were now becoming standard, and the Hand of God becoming rarer.  At the same period other works, like the large Genesis [[altarpiece]] by the Hamburg painter [[Meister Bertram]], continued to use the old depiction of Christ as ''Logos'' in Genesis scenes.  In the 15th century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the Trinity as [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of Christ]].

In an early Venetian school [[Coronation of the Virgin]] by [[Giovanni d'Alemagna]] and [[Antonio Vivarini]], (c. 1443) The Father is depicted using the symbol consistently used by other artists later, namely a patriarch, with benign, yet powerful countenance and with long white hair and a beard, a depiction largely derived from, and justified by, the near-physical, but still figurative, description of the [[Ancient of Days]].&lt;ref&gt;Bigham Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

. ...the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. ([[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7:9)

[[File:Andrea_del_Verrocchio,_Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Baptism_of_Christ_-_Uffizi.jpg|left|thumb|Usage of two ''Hands of God''&quot;(relatively unusual) and the [[Holy Spirit]] as a dove in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|Baptism of Christ, by Verrocchio]], 1472]]

In the Annunciation by [[Benvenuto di Giovanni]] in 1470, God the Father is portrayed in the red robe and a hat that resembles that of a Cardinal. However, even in the later part of the 15th century, the symbolic representation of the Father and the Holy Spirit as &quot;hands and dove&quot; continued, e.g. in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|Verrocchio's Baptism of Christ]] in 1472.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur de Bles, 2004 ''How to Distinguish the Saints in Art by Their Costumes, Symbols and Attributes'' ISBN 1-4179-0870-X page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:God_the_Father_with_His_Right_Hand_Raised_in_Blessing.jpg|thumb|''God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing'', with a triangular halo representing the Trinity, [[Girolamo dai Libri]] c. 1555]]
In Renaissance paintings of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father using an old man, usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as a reference to the Trinity), or with a papal crown, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book (to symbolize God's knowledge and as a reference to how knowledge is deemed divine). He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the [[Throne of Mercy]] iconography. A dove, the symbol of the [[Holy Spirit]] may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian [[Pietà]], God the Father is often symbolized using a man wearing a papal dress and a papal crown, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They are depicted as floating in heaven with angels who carry the [[instruments of the Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, 1987 ''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' ISBN 0-313-24658-0 pages 8 and 283&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of God the Father and the Trinity were attacked both by Protestants and within Catholicism, by the [[Jansenist]] and [[Baianist]] movements as well as more orthodox theologians.  As with other attacks on Catholic imagery, this had the effect both of reducing Church support for the less central depictions, and strengthening it for the core ones.  In the [[Western Church]], the pressure to restrain religious imagery resulted in the highly influential decrees of the final session of the [[Council of Trent]] in 1563. The Council of Trent decrees confirmed the traditional Catholic doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person, not the image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic depictions of God the Father were uncontroversial in Catholic art thereafter, but less common depictions of the [[Trinity]] were condemned.  In 1745 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] explicitly supported the [[Throne of Mercy]] depiction, referring to the &quot;Ancient of Days&quot;, but in 1786 it was still necessary for [[Pope Pius VI]] to issue a [[papal bull]] condemning the decision of an Italian church council to remove all images of the Trinity from churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Creation of Adam.jpg|thumb|The famous ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'' by [[Michelangelo]], c.1512|700x700px]]
God the Father is symbolized in several Genesis scenes in [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], most famously ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'' (whose image of near touching hands of God and Adam is iconic of humanity, being a reminder that Man is created in the Image and Likeness of God ({{Bibleref2|Gen|1:26|NRSV}})).God the Father is depicted as a powerful figure, floating in the clouds in [[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Titian's Assumption of the Virgin]] in the [[Frari of Venice]], long admired as a masterpiece of [[High Renaissance]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Lohr Martz, 1991 ''From Renaissance to baroque: essays on literature and art'' ISBN 0-8262-0796-0 page 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome includes a number of 16th century depictions of [[God the Father]]. In some of these paintings the [[Trinity]] is still alluded to in terms of three angels, but  [[Giovanni Battista Fiammeri]] also depicted God the Father as a man riding on a cloud, above the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Gauvin A. Bailey, 2003 ''Between Renaissance and Baroque: Jesuit art in Rome'' ISBN 0-8020-3721-6 page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the Last Judgment and the Coronation of the Virgin paintings by [[Rubens]] he depicted God the Father using the image that by then had become widely accepted, a bearded patriarchal figure above the fray.  In the 17th century, the two Spanish artists [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] (whose father-in-law [[Francisco Pacheco]] was in charge of the approval of new images for the Inquisition) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] both depicted God the Father using a patriarchal figure with a white beard in a purple robe.

While representations of God the Father were growing in Italy, Spain, Germany and the Low Countries, there was resistance elsewhere in Europe, even during the 17th century. In 1632 most members of the [[Star Chamber]] court in England (except the [[Archbishop of York]]) condemned the use of the images of the Trinity in church windows, and some considered them illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' ISBN 1-103-66622-3, (2009) page 229&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 17th century [[Sir Thomas Browne]] wrote that he considered the representation of God the Father using an old man &quot;a dangerous act&quot; that might lead to Egyptian symbolism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;Sir Thomas Browne's Works, 1852, ISBN 0559376871, 2006 page 156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Charles Winston was still critical of such images as a &quot;''[[Romish|Romish trend]]''&quot; (a term used to refer to [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholics]]) that he considered best avoided in England.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' ISBN 1-103-66622-3, (2009) page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1667 the 43rd chapter of the [[Moscow Sobor of 1666–1667|Great Moscow Council]] specifically included a ban on a number of symbolic depictions of God the Father and the Holy Spirit, which then also resulted in a whole range of other icons being placed on the forbidden list,&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Tarasov, 2004 ''Icon and devotion: sacred spaces in Imperial Russia'' ISBN 1-86189-118-0 page 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genuineorthodoxchurch.com/moscow_1666.htm Orthodox church web site]&lt;/ref&gt; mostly affecting Western-style depictions which had been gaining ground in Orthodox icons. The Council also declared that the person of the Trinity who was the &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; was Christ, as ''Logos'', not God the Father. However some icons continued to be produced in Russia, as well as [[Greece]], [[Romania]], and other Orthodox countries.

==Theological approaches==
Theologians and philosophers have attributed to God such characteristics as [[omniscience]], [[omnipotence]], [[omnipresence]], perfect [[Good and evil|goodness]], divine [[simplicity]], and [[eternity|eternal]] and [[Necessary Existent|necessary]] existence. God has been described as [[Incorporeality|incorporeal]], a personal being, the source of all [[moral obligation]], and the greatest conceivable being existent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swinburne&quot; /&gt; These attributes were all claimed to varying degrees by the early [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] scholars, including [[Maimonides]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot; /&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot; /&gt; and [[Al-Ghazali]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga|Plantinga, Alvin]]. &quot;God, Arguments for the Existence of&quot;, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[philosopher]]s developed arguments for the existence of God,&lt;ref name=&quot;Platinga&quot; /&gt; while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of God's attributes. Reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates. For example, God's omniscience may seem to imply that God knows how free agents will choose to act. If God does know this, their ostensible [[free will]] might be illusory, or foreknowledge does not imply predestination, and if God does not know it, God may not be omniscient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wierenga&quot;&gt;Wierenga, Edward R. &quot;Divine foreknowledge&quot; in [[Robert Audi|Audi, Robert]]. ''The Cambridge Companion to Philosophy''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last centuries of philosophy have seen vigorous questions regarding the [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments for God's existence]] raised by such philosophers as [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hume]] and [[Antony Flew]], although Kant held that the [[argument from morality]] was valid. The [[theist]] response has been either to contend, as does [[Alvin Plantinga]], that faith is &quot;[[reformed epistemology|properly basic]]&quot;, or to take, as does [[Richard Swinburne]], the [[evidentialist]] position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Michael |last=Beaty |year=1991 |title=God Among the Philosophers |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=53 |journal=The Christian Century |accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Theism|theists]] agree that only some of the arguments for God's existence are compelling, but argue that [[faith]] is not a product of [[reason]], but requires risk. There would be no risk, they say, if the arguments for God's existence were as solid as the laws of logic, a position summed up by [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] as &quot;the heart has reasons of which reason does not know.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal, Blaise]]. ''[[Pensées]]'', 1669.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent theory using concepts from physics and neurophysiology proposes that God can be conceptualized within the theory of [[integrative level]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikoletseas, Michael M. (2014). Deus Absconditus - The Hidden God. ISBN 978-1495336225&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious believers allow for the existence of other, less powerful [[spiritual being]]s such as [[angel]]s, [[saint]]s, [[jinn]], [[demon]]s, and [[Deva (New Age)|devas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tuesday, December 8, 2009|url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/more_americans_believe_in_angels_than_global_warming/|title=More Americans Believe in Angels than Global Warming|publisher=Outsidethebeltway.com|date=December 8, 2009|accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Van |first=David |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1842179,00.html|title=Guardian Angels Are Here, Say Most Americans|publisher=TIME |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57347634/poll-nearly-8-in-10-americans-believe-in-angels/ |title=Poll: Nearly 8 in 10 Americans believe in angels |publisher=CBS News|date=December 23, 2011|accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/06/23/ST2008062300818.html|title=Most Americans Believe in Higher Power, Poll Finds|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2012-12-04|first=Jacqueline L.|last=Salmon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 15:27&lt;/ref&gt;
