{{Main|Georgia Tech traditions}}

===Mascots===
{{Main|Buzz (mascot)|Ramblin' Wreck}}
[[File:Georgia Tech mascot Buzz.jpg|thumb|right|Buzz, the mascot]] Costumed in [[plush]] to look like a [[yellow jacket]], the official [[mascot]] of Georgia Tech is '''[[Buzz (mascot)|Buzz]]'''. Buzz enters the football games at the sound of swarming yellow jackets and proceeds to do a flip on the fifty-yard line GT logo. He then bull rushes the goal post and has been known to knock it out of alignment before football games. Buzz is also notorious for [[crowd surfing]] and general light-hearted trickery amongst Tech and rival fans.

The '''[[Rambling Wreck|Ramblin' Wreck]]''' was the first official mascot of Georgia Tech. It is a 1930 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]] Sports Coupe. The Wreck has led the football team onto the field every home game since 1961. The Wreck features a gold and white paint job, two gold flags emblazoned with the words &quot;To Hell With Georgia&quot; and &quot;Give 'Em Hell Tech&quot;, and a white soft top. The Wreck is maintained by the '''Ramblin' Reck Club''', a selective student leadership organization on campus.

===Spirit organizations===
[[File:GT Football Score.jpg|thumb|right|Tech cheerleaders waving flags after a touchdown.]]
The Ramblin' Reck Club is charged with upholding all school traditions and creating new traditions such as the SWARM. The SWARM is a 900-member spirit group seated along the north end zone or on the court at basketball games. This is the group that typically features [[body painting]], organized [[chants]], and general [[fanaticism]].

The marching band that performs at halftime and after big plays during the football season is clad in all white and sits next to SWARM at football games providing a dichotomy of white and gold in the North End Zone. The band is also the primary student organization on campus that upholds the tradition of RAT caps, wherein band freshman wear the traditional yellow cap at all band events.

===Fight songs and chants===
The band plays the fight songs ''[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]'' and ''[[Georgia Tech traditions#Up With the White and Gold|Up With the White and Gold]]'' after every football score and between every basketball period. At the end of a rendition of either fight song, there is a series of drum beats followed by the cheer &quot;Go Jackets&quot; three times (each time followed by a second cheer of &quot;bust their ass&quot;), then a different drum beat and the cheer &quot;Fight, Win, Drink, Get Naked!&quot; The official cheer only includes &quot;Fight, Win&quot; but most present other than the band and cheerleaders will yell the extended version.

It is also tradition for the band to play the [[Here Comes the King|&quot;When You Say Budweiser&quot;]] after the third quarter of football and during the second-to-last official timeout of every basketball game. During the [[Here Comes the King#Popular culture|&quot;Budweiser Song&quot;]], all of the fans in the stadium alternate bending their knees and standing up straight. Other notable band songs are [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]'' for half-time at the [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum|Thrillerdome]], [[Ludacris]]' ''Move Bitch'' for large gains in football. Another popular chant is called the Good Word and it begins with asking, &quot;What's the Good Word?&quot; The response from all Tech faithful is, &quot;To Hell With Georgia.&quot; The same question is asked three times and then the followup is asked, &quot;How 'bout them dogs?&quot; And everyone yells, &quot;Piss on 'em.&quot;
