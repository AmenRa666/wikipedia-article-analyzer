The '''architecture of Africa''', like other aspects of the [[culture of Africa]], is exceptionally  diverse. Throughout the [[history of Africa]], Africans have had their own [[architecture|architectural]] traditions. In some cases, broader styles can be identified, such as the [[Sudano-Sahelian|Sahelian architecture]] of an area of [[West Africa]].
One common theme in much traditional African architecture is the use of [[fractal]] scaling: small parts of the structure tend to look similar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Eglash| first = Ron| title = African Fractals Modern Computing and Indigenous Design| year = 1999| isbn = 978-0-8135-2613-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PyramidDatePalms.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]] are regarded as one of the greatest architectural feats of all times, and one of [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders]] of the Ancient World.]]
As with most architectural traditions elsewhere, African architecture has been subject to numerous external influences from the earliest periods for which evidence is available. [[Western world|Western]] architecture has also influenced coastal areas since the late 15th century, and is now an important source for many larger buildings, particularly in major cities.

African architecture uses a wide range of materials. One finds structures in thatch, stick/wood, mud, [[mudbrick]], [[rammed earth]], and stone, with the preference for materials varying by region: North Africa for stone and [[rammed earth]], Horn of Africa for drystone and mortar, West Africa for mud/adobe, Central Africa for thatch/wood and more perishable materials, Southeast and Southern Africa for stone and thatch/wood.

==Early architecture==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Meroe pyramids 01 x600.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]ite pyramids, influenced by [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian architecture]], c. 11th century BC.]] --&gt;
Probably the most famous class of structures in all Africa, the [[pyramid]]s of [[Egypt]] remain one of the world's greatest early architectural achievements, if limited in practical scope and originating from a purely funerary context. Egyptian architectural traditions also saw the rise of vast temple complexes and buildings.

Little is known of ancient architecture south and west of the Sahara. Harder to date are the monoliths around the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]], which has geometric or human designs.  The vast number of [[Senegambian stone circles]] also evidence an emerging architecture.

===North Africa===

====Egypt====
{{Main| Egyptian architecture}}

Egypt's achievements in architecture were varied from temples, enclosed cities, canals, and dams.

====Maghreban Architecture====
Thousands of tombs were left by [[Berber people|Berbers]] that were pre-Christian in origin and whose architecture was unique to north-west Africa. The most famous was [[Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania|Tomb of the Christian Woman]] in western Algeria. This structure contains column domed and spiraling pathways that lead to a single chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Davidson| first = Basil| title = Africa in History| year = 1995| isbn = 0-684-82667-4| page = 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nubia====
{{Main|Nubian architecture}}

[[File:Kerma city.JPG|left|300px|thumb|The city of Kerma]]

[[Nubian Architecture]] is one of the most ancient in the world. The earliest style of [[Nubian Architecture]] include the [[speos]],  structures carved out of solid rock, an [[A-Group]](3700-3250 BCE) achievement. Egyptians made extensive use of the process at [[Speos Artemidos]] and [[Abu Simbel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bianchi| first = Robert Steven| title = Daily Life of the Nubians| year = 2004| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-313-32501-4| page = 227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A-Group]] eventually led to [[C-Group]]. [[C-Group]] began with light, supple materials, animal skins, and [[wattle and daub]]. Later larger more structures of [[mudbrick]]s became the norm. [[C-Group]] culture was related to [[Kerma]].&lt;ref&gt;Bietak, Manfred. [http://www.numibia.net/nubia/c-group.htm The C-Group culture and the Pan Grave culture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511234450/http://www.numibia.net/nubia/c-group.htm |date=May 11, 2009 }}. Cairo: Austrian Archaeological Institute&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kerma]] was settled around 2400 BC. It was a walled city containing religious building, large circular dwelling, a palace, and well laid out roads. On the East side of the city, funerary temple and chapel were laid out. It supported a population of 2,000. One of its most enduring structures was the [[Nubian architecture|Deffufa]], a [[mudbrick]] temple ceremonies were performed on top. Between 1500-1085 BC, Egyptian conquest and domination of [[Nubia]] was achieved. [[File:Nubia pyramids1.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Nubian pyramids at Meroe]]This conquest brought about the [[Napata]]n Phase of Nubian history, the birth of the [[Kingdom of Kush]]. [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] was immensely influenced by [[Egypt]] and eventually conquered [[Egypt]]. During this phase, we see the building of numerous pyramids and temples. [[Gebel Barkal]] in the town of [[Napata]] was a very significant site. Kushite pharaohs received legitimacy. Thirteen temples have been excavated and two palaces in [[Napata]]. [[Napata]] has yet to be fully excavated.  [[Nubian pyramids]] were constructed on three major sites [[El Kurru]], [[Nuri]], and [[Meroe]]. Sudan has more pyramids than Egypt. [[Sudan]] contains 223 [[pyramids]]. They were smaller than [[Egyptian Pyramids]]. [[Nubian pyramids]] were for Kings and Queens. The general construction of [[Nubian pyramids]] consisted of steep walls, a chapel facing East, stairway facing East, and a chamber access via the stairway.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Timothy.

===Horn of Africa===

====Aksumite====
{{Main|Aksumite architecture}}
[[File:Yeha Tigray Ethiopia.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The ruin of the temple at Yeha, Tigray region, Ethiopia.]]
The best known building of the period in the region is the ruined 8th-century BC multi-storey tower at [[Yeha]] in [[Ethiopia]], believed to have been the capital of [[D'mt]].

[[Aksumite Architecture]] flourished in the region from the 4th century BC onward, persisting even after the transition of the [[Aksumite Empire|Aksumite dynasty]] to the [[Zagwe dynasty|Zagwe]] in the 12th century, as attested by the numerous Aksumite influences in and around the medieval churches of [[Lalibela, Ethiopia|Lalibela]]. Stelae (''hawilt''s) and later entire [[church (building)|church]]es were carved out of single blocks of rock, emulated later at Lalibela and throughout [[Tigray Province|Tigray]]. Other monumental structures include massive underground tombs often located beneath stelae. The stelae is the single largest monolithic structure ever erected (or attempted to be erected). Other well-known structures employing the use of monoliths include tombs such as the &quot;[[Tomb of the False Door]]&quot; and the tombs of [[Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb]] and [[Gebre Mesqel]] in [[Axum]].

Most structures, however, like palaces, villas, commoner's houses, and other churches and monasteries, were built of alternating layers of stone and wood. The protruding wooden support beams in these structures have been named &quot;monkey heads&quot; and are a staple of Aksumite architecture and a mark of Aksumite influence in later structures. Some examples of this style had whitewashed exteriors and/or interiors, such as the medieval 12th-century monastery of [[Yemrehanna Krestos]] near Lalibela, built during the Zagwe dynasty in Aksumite style. Contemporary houses were one-room stone structures or two-storey square houses or [[roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]] of [[sandstone]] with [[basalt]] [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]]s. Villas were generally two to four stories tall and built on sprawling rectangular plans (cf. [[Dungur]] ruins). A good example of still-standing Aksumite architecture is the monastery of [[Debre Damo]] from the 6th century.

===West Africa===

====Nok====
[[Nok culture]] artifacts have been dated as far back as 790 BCE, located at the [[Jos Plateau]] in [[Nigeria]],  between the [[Niger]] and [[Benue River]].  From the excavation of the Nok settlement in [[Samun Dikiya]], there was the tendency to build on peaks. Nok settlements have not been extensively excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Coquery-Vidrovitch| first = Catherine| title = The History of African Cities South of the Sahara From the Origins to Colonization| year = 2005| publisher = Markus Wiener Pub| isbn = 978-1-55876-303-6| pages = 44–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://web.archive.org/web/20090101092030/http://www.mauritania.mr/fnsva/photo_tichit.htm Tichitt Walata] is the oldest surviving collection of archaeological settlements in [[West Africa]] and the oldest of all stone base settlement south of the Sahara. It was built by the [[Soninke people]] and is thought to be the precursor of the [[Ghana empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0021853700018685 | volume=21 | title=Archaeology and the prehistoric origins of the Ghana empire | journal=The Journal of African History | pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was settled by agropastoral people around 2000 BCE - 300 BCE which makes it almost 1000 years older than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631071309000996|doi=10.1016/j.crte.2009.04.005 | volume=341 | title=Coping with uncertainty: Neolithic life in the Dhar Tichitt-Walata, Mauritania, (ca. 4000–2300 BP) | journal=Comptes Rendus Geoscience | pages=703–712}}&lt;/ref&gt; One finds well laid out streets and fortified compounds all made out of skilled stone masonry.

==Medieval Architecture==

===North Africa===
[[File:Grande Mosquée de Kairouan, vue d'ensemble.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], also called Mosque of Uqba, is the oldest mosque in North Africa (7th to 9th centuries), [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].]]

The Islamic conquest of North Africa saw [[Islamic architecture]] develop in the region, including such famous structures as the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] or the [[Cairo Citadel]].

Around 1000 AD, [[Cob (material)|cob]] (tabya) first appears in the Maghreb and al-Andalus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1996), &quot;Engineering&quot;, p. 766, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=751–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horn of Africa===

====Somalia====
[[File:Zayla.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[Muslim]] [[Adal Sultanate|Sultanate of Adal]] in Zeila, Somalia]]
{{Main|Somalian architecture}}
[[Architecture of Somalia|Somali architecture]] is a rich and diverse tradition of  [[engineering]] and [[designing]] multiple different [[construction]] types such as [[masonry|stone cities]], [[castles]], [[citadel]]s, [[fortresses]], [[mosques]], [[temples]], [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]], [[lighthouses]], towers and [[tombs]] during the ancient, [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] periods in [[Somalia]]. It also encompasses the fusion of Somalo-Islamic architecture with Western designs in [[contemporary architecture|contemporary]] times.

In ancient Somalia, pyramidical structures known in [[Somali language|Somali]] as ''taalo'' were a popular burial style with hundreds of these [[drystone]] monuments scattered around the country today. Houses were built of [[Stonemasonry|dressed stone]] similar to the ones in [[Ancient Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;Man, God and Civilization pg 216&lt;/ref&gt; and there are examples of courtyards and large stone walls such as the [[Wargaade Wall]] enclosing settlements.

The peaceful introduction of [[Islam]] in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural influences]] from [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]], which stimulated a shift in construction from [[drystone]] and other related materials to [[Masonry|coral stone]], [[mud-brick|sundried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as [[mosques]] were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Diriye, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aksumite====
[[File:Bet Medhane Alem church Lalibela.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bete Medhane Alem, [[Lalibela, Ethiopia|Lalibela]], the largest monolithic church in the world.]]
Throughout the medieval period, Aksumite architecture and influences and its monolithic tradition persisted, with its influence strongest in the early medieval (Late Aksumite) and Zagwe periods (when the churches of Lalibela were carved). Throughout the medieval period, and especially during the 10th to 12th centuries, churches were hewn out of rock throughout Ethiopia, especially during the northernmost region of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], which was the heart of the Aksumite Empire. However, rock-hewn churches have been found as far south as [[Adadi Maryam]] (15th century), about 100&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Addis Abeba]]. The most famous example of Ethiopian rock-hewn architecture are the 11 monolithic churches of Lalibela, carved out of the red volcanic tuff found around the town. Though later medieval hagiographies attribute all 11 structures to the eponymous king [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela|Lalibela]] (the town was called Roha and Adefa before his reign), new evidence indicates that they may have been built separately over a period of a few centuries, with only a few of the more recent churches having been built under his reign. Archaeologist and ''Ethiopisant'' David Phillipson postulates, for instance, that Bete Gebriel-Rufa'el was actually built in the very early medieval period, some time between 600 and 800 AD, originally as a fortress but was later turned into a church.[http://www.archaeology.org/0411/newsbriefs/ethiopia.html]

===West Africa===
{{Further|Sudano-Sahelian}}

[[File:Great Mosque of Djenné 3.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Great Mosque of Djenné]] in [[Mali]], first built in the 13th century and reconstructed in 1906&amp;ndash;1909, is the largest clay building in the world.]]

====Ghana====
At [[Kumbi Saleh]], locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques (as described by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri|al-bakri]]), one centered on [[Friday prayer]].[[File:TIMBUKTU-EINZUG.jpg|thumb|400px|right| Timbuktu]]&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Ghana. Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana, The Society, 1957, pp81&lt;/ref&gt; The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long, forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Basil. The Lost Cities of Africa. Boston: Little Brown, 1959, pp86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudano-Sahelian|Sahelian architecture]] initially grew from the two cities of [[Djenné]] and [[Timbuktu]].  The [[Sankore]] Mosque in [[Timbuktu]], constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the [[Great Mosque of Djenné]].

====Kanem-Bornu====
[[Kanem-Bornu]]'s capital city [[Birni N'Gazargamu]], may have had a population of 200,000. It had four mosque which could hold up to 12,000 worshippers. It was surrounded by a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} wall and more than {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} in circumference. Many large streets extended from the esplanade and connected to 660 roads. The main building and structure were built with red brick. Other buildings were built with straw and adobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Coquery-Vidrovitch| first = Catherine| title = The History of African Cities South of the Sahara From the Origins to Colonization| year = 2005| publisher = Markus Wiener Pub| isbn = 978-1-55876-303-6| pages = 106–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hausa Kingdoms====
Six important [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] city states existed [[Kano]], [[Katsina]], [[Daura]], [[Gobir]], [[Zazzau]], and [[Hadejia|Biram]]. [[Kano]] was the most important. The city was surrounded by a wall of reinforced ramparts of stone and bricks. Kano contained a citadel near which the royal class resided. Individual residence was separated by &quot;earthen&quot; wall. The higher the status of the resident the more elaborate the wall. The entranceway was mazelike to seclude women. Inside near the entrance were the abode of unmarried women. Further down were slave quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Coquery-Vidrovitch| first = Catherine| title = The History of African Cities South of the Sahara From the Origins to Colonization| year = 2005| publisher = Markus Wiener Pub| isbn = 978-1-55876-303-6| pages = 123–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kano-engraving.jpg||thumb|left|200px|The city of Kano]]

====Benin====
{{Further|Walls of Benin}}
[[File:Drawing of Benin City made by an English officer 1897.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Drawing of [[Benin City]] made by an English officer, 1897]]
The rise of kingdoms in the West African coastal region produced architecture which drew on indigenous traditions, utilizing wood.  The famed [[Benin City]], destroyed by the [[Punitive Expedition]], was a large complex of homes in coursed mud, with hipped roofs of [[Shake (roof)|shingles]] or palm leaves.  The Palace had a sequence of ceremonial rooms, and was decorated with [[Benin Bronzes|brass plaques]]. The [[Walls of Benin]] City are collectively the world's largest man-made structure.&lt;ref&gt;Wesler,Kit W.(1998). Historical archaeology in Nigeria. Africa World Press pp.143,144 ISBN ISBN 0-86543-610-X, 9780865436107.&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Pearce wrote in New scientist:

:::&quot;They extend for some 16,000 kilometres in all, in a mosaic of more than 500 interconnected settlement boundaries. They cover 6500 square kilometres and were all dug by the [[Edo]] people. In all, they are four times longer than the Great Wall of China, and consumed a hundred times more material than the Great Pyramid of Cheops. They took an estimated 150 million hours of digging to construct, and are perhaps the largest single archaeological phenomenon on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Fred.

====Ashanti====
[[File:Koussoukoingou2.jpg|thumb|A traditional tata-somba house in Benin]]
[[File:Kumasi.png|thumb|200px|left|Image of traditional Ashanti house]]
[[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] architecture from Ghana is perhaps best known from the reconstruction at [[Kumasi]].  Its key features are [[courtyard]]-based buildings, and walls with striking reliefs in mud [[plaster]] brightly painted.  An example of a [[shrine]] can be seen at [[Bawjiase]] in [[Ghana]].  Four rectangular rooms, constructed from [[wattle and daub]], lie around a [[courtyard]].  Animal designs mark the walls, and [[arecaceae|palm]] leaves cut to tiered shape provide the roof.

====Yoruba====
{{Further|Sungbo's Eredo}}

The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] surrounded their settlements with massive mud [[city wall|walls]].  Their buildings had a similar plan to the Ashanti shrines, but with [[verandah]]s around the court.  The walls were of puddled mud and [[palm oil]]. The most famous of the Yoruba fortifications and the second largest wall edifice in Africa is [[Sungbo's Eredo]], a structure that was built in honour of a traditional [[Oba (ruler)#Aristocratic titles among the Yoruba|oloye]] by the name of Bilikisu Sungbo in the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries. It is made up of sprawling mud walls and the valleys that surrounded the town of Ijebu-Ode in Ogun state. [[Sungbo's Eredo]] is the largest pre-colonial monument in [[Africa]], larger than [[the Great Pyramid]] or [[Great Zimbabwe]].

===East Africa===
[[Engaruka]] is a ruined settlement on the slopes of Mount Ngorongoro in northern Tanzania.
Seven stone terraced villages along the mountainside comprised the settlement. A complex
structure of stone channel irrigation was used to dike, dam, and level surrounding river
waters. The stone channels run along the mountainside and base. Some of these channels were
several kilometers long channelling and feeding individual plots of land. The irrigation channels fed a total area of {{convert|5000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hull| first = Richard W.| title = African Cities and Towns Before the European Conquest| year = 1976| publisher = New York : Norton| isbn = 978-0-393-05581-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Shillington| first = Kevin| title = Encyclopedia of African history| year = 2004| isbn = 1-57958-453-5| page = 1368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Burundi====
[[Burundi]] never had a fixed capital. The closest thing was a royal hill, when the king moved, the location became the capital called the insago. The compound itself was enclosed inside a high fence. The compound had two entrance. One was for herders and herds. The other was to the royal palace. This palace was surrounded by a fence. The royal palace had three royal courtyard. Each serve a particular function one for herders, a sanctuary, kitchen and granary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Coquery-Vidrovitch| first = Catherine| title = The History of African Cities South of the Sahara From the Origins to Colonization| year = 2005| publisher = Markus Wiener Pub| isbn = 978-1-55876-303-6| page = 68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rwanda====
[[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]] was a royal capital of [[Rwanda]]. The king's residence the Ibwami was built on a hill. The surrounding hills were occupied by permanent or temporary dwellings. These dwellings were round huts surrounded by big yards and high hedge to separate compounds. The [[Rugo]] the royal compound was made of circular reed fence around thatched houses. The houses were carpeted with mats and had a clay hearth in the center for the king, his wife, and entourage. The royal house was close to 200-100 yards. It looked like a huge maze of connected huts and granaries. It had one entrance that lead to a large public square called the karubanda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Coquery-Vidrovitch| first = Catherine| title = The History of African Cities South of the Sahara From the Origins to Colonization| year = 2005| publisher = Markus Wiener Pub| isbn = 978-1-55876-303-6| pages = 69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kitara and Bunyoro====
In western [[Uganda]] one finds numerous earthworks near the [[Katonga River]]. These earthworks have been affiliated with the [[Empire of Kitara]]. The most famous [[Bigo Bya Mugenyi]] is about four square miles with the [[Katonga River]] on one side. The earthwork ditch was dug out by lifting cutting through solid bedrock and earth, about 200,000 cubic metres. It was about {{convert|12|ft|m}} high. It is not certain whether the function was for defense or pastoral use. Very little is known about the Ugandan earthworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Tracy| first = James D.| title = City Walls The Urban Enceinte in Global Perspective| year = 2000| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-65221-6| page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buganda====
The capital (kibuga) of [[Buganda]] constantly changed from hill to hill, with each change of [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]. In the late 19th century, a permanent [[Kibuga]] of [[Buganda]] was established at [[Mengo, Uganda|Mengo Hill]]. The capital was divided into quarters corresponding to provinces. Each chief built a dwelling corresponding to provinces. Each chief built a dwelling for wife, slaves, dependents, and visitors. The city was a mile and half wide. Large plots of land were available for planting bananas and fruits. Roads were wide and well maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Coquery-Vidrovitch| first = Catherine| title = The History of African Cities South of the Sahara From the Origins to Colonization| year = 2005| publisher = Markus Wiener Pub| isbn = 978-1-55876-303-6| page = 74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nubia (Christian and Islamic)====
{{Further|Nubian architecture}}

The Christianization of [[Nubia]] began in the 6th century. Its most representative architecture are churches. They are based on [[Byzantium]] [[Basilica]]'s. The structures are relatively small and made of mud bricks. [[Vernacular architecture]] of the Christian period is scarce. Architecture of [[Soba (city)]] is the only one that has been excavated. The structures are of sun dried bricks, same as present day Sudan, except for an arch. During the Fatimide phase of Islam, about the 11th century Nubia converted to Islam and became arabized. Its most import mosque was the mosque of Derr.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann, Peter. [http://www.numibia.net/nubia/christian.htm Christian Nubia and Its Churches] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516005111/http://www.numibia.net/nubia/christian.htm |date=May 16, 2009 }}.

====Swahili States====
Farther south, increased trade (namely with Arab merchants) and the development of [[port]]s saw the birth of [[Swahili architecture]].  Developed from an outgrowth of indigenous Bantu settlements,&lt;ref&gt;African Archaeological Review, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1998 , pp. 199-218(20)&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest examples is the [[Palace of Husuni Kubwa]] lying west of [[Kilwa (district)|Kilwa]], built about 1245.  As with many other early Swahili buildings, [[coral rag|coral]] was the main construction material, and even the roof was constructed by attaching coral to timbers.  Contrastingly, the palace at [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] was a two-story tower, in a walled enclosure.  Other notable structures from the period include the [[pillar tomb]]s as [[Malindi]] and [[Mnarani]] in [[Kenya]], and elsewhere, originally built from [[coral rag|coral]] but later from stone.  Later examples include [[Zanzibar]]'s [[Stone Town]], with its famous carved doors, and the [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]].

===Central Africa===

====Kongo====
[[File:Kongocapital.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The capital of the Kingdom of Kongo]]
[[Mbanza Congo]] was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] with a population of 30,000 plus.  It sat on a cliff with river below and forested valley. The King's dwelling was described as a mile and half enclosure with walled pathways, courtyard, gardens, decorated huts, and palisades. One early explorer described it in terms of a Cretan labyrinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Coquery-Vidrovitch| first = Catherine| title = The History of African Cities South of the Sahara From the Origins to Colonization| year = 2005| publisher = Markus Wiener Pub| isbn = 978-1-55876-303-6| page = 77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kuba====
The capital of the [[Kuba Kingdom]] was surrounded by a {{convert|40|in|mm|adj=mid|-high}} fence. Inside the fence were roads, a walled royal palace, urban buildings. The palace was rectangular and in the center of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Coquery-Vidrovitch| first = Catherine| title = The History of African Cities South of the Sahara From the Origins to Colonization| year = 2005| publisher = Markus Wiener Pub| isbn = 978-1-55876-303-6| page = 83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Luba====
The [[Luba Empire|Luba]] tended to cluster in small villages, with rectangular houses facing a single street.
Kilolo, patrilineal chieftains, headed local village government, under the protection of the king.
Cultural life centered around the [[kitenta]], the royal compound, which later came to be a permanent
capital. The kitenta drew artists, poets, musicians and craftsmen, spurred by royal and court patronage

====Lunda====
The [[Lunda Empire]] (western) established its capital 100&amp;nbsp;km from [[Kassai]] in open woodland, between two rivers 15&amp;nbsp;km apart. It was surrounded by fortified earthen ramparts. and dry moats about 30 plus km . The [[Mwato Yamvo]]'s compound [[musumba]] was surrounded with large fortification of  double layered live trees or wood ramparts. The [[musumba]] had multiple courtyards with designated functions,  straight  roads, and public squares. Its immense hygienic and cleanly value has been noted by European observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Birmingham| first = David| title = Central Africa to 1870 Zambezia, Zaire and the South Atlantic| year = 1981| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-28444-8| page = 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lunda dwellings displaying the Square and the Cone On Ground type of African Vernacular Architecture]]

====Eastern Lunda====
The [[Eastern Lunda]] dwelling of the [[Kacembe]](king) was described as containing fenced roads, a mile long. The enclosed walls were made of grass, 12 to 13 span in height. The enclosed roads lead to a rectangular hut opened on the west side. In the center was a wooden base with a statue on top about 3 span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = African Civilization Revisiteed From Antiquity to Modern Times| year = 1991| isbn = 978-0-86543-124-9| pages = 343–344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maravi====
The [[Maravi]] people built bridges called Uraro due to changing river depth. These bridges were made out of bamboo. Bamboos were placed parallel to each other and tied together by bark (maruze). One end of the bridge would be tied to an existing tree. The bridge would curve downward 80 spans when entering. A bamboo on top would serve as a balustrade.

===Southern Africa===
In Southern Africa one finds ancient and widespread traditions of building in stone. Two broad categories of these tradition have been noted: 1. Zimbabwean style 2. Transvaal Free State style. North of the Zambezi one finds very few stone ruins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Description of the Site&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Dierks| first = Klaus| title = Khauxa!nas| year = 1992| isbn = 978-99916-1-006-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Indian Ocean island of [[Madagascar]], geopolitically part of Southern Africa, is culturally distinct as reflected by the Southeast Asian influences in its architectural styles brought to the island by the first seafaring migrants to settle there.

====Afrikaner====
[[Image:Burgher House, Stellenbosch.JPG|thumb|Typical Cape Dutch styled house in [[Stellenbosch]]]]
[[Cape Dutch architecture]] is a traditional South African [[Afrikaner]] architecture and is one of the most distinctive styles of 'settler' architecture in the world. It is known as the 'Cape Dutch' style, because it developed during the century and a half that the Cape was a Dutch colony. Even at the end of that period, at the beginning of the 19th century, the colony was inhabited by fewer than fifty thousand people, mostly of white and brown complexion. This number was spread over an area roughly the size of the United Kingdom. Yet despite their small number, over such a vast area, the Cape Dutch style was of an amazing consistency, clearly related to rural architecture in northwestern Europe, but equally clearly with its own unmistakable African character and features. &lt;ref&gt;Jona Schellekens, &quot;Dutch Origins of South-African Colonial Architecture,&quot; Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 56 (1997), pp. 204–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shona====
[[Mapungubwe]] is considered the most socially complex society in southern Africa.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The first southern African culture to display economic differentiation. The elite was separated on a mountain settlement, made of sandstone. It was the precursor to [[Great Zimbabwe]]. Large tracks of dirt was carried to the top of the hill. At the bottom of the hill was a natural amphipheater and at the top elite graveyard. There was only two pathway to the top, one was a narrow steep cleft along the side of the hill which observers at the top had a clear view.

[[File:Great-Zimbabwe-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The conical tower inside the Great Enclosure in [[Great Zimbabwe]], a medieval city built by a prosperous culture]]
[[Great Zimbabwe]] is the largest medieval city in sub-Saharan Africa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} [[Great Zimbabwe]] was constructed and expanded for more than 300 years in a local style that eschewed rectilinearity for flowing curves. Neither the first nor the last of some 300 similar complexes located on the Zimbabwean plateau, [[Great Zimbabwe]] is set apart by the terrific scale of its structure. Its most formidable edifice, commonly referred to as the Great Enclosure, has dressed stone walls as high as {{convert|36|ft|m}} extending approximately {{convert|820|ft|m}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ireland| first = Jeannie| title = History of Interior Design| year = 2009| publisher = Fairchild Books &amp; Visuals| isbn = 978-1-56367-462-4| page = 65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest ancient structure south of the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]].  Houses within the enclosure were circular and constructed of [[wattle and daub]], with conical thatched roofs.

[[Thulamela]] was a counterpart of [[Mapungubwe]] and [[Great Zimbabwe]] that displayed similar architectural design and method.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[File:Khamiruins2.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Terraced hill, entranceway of [[Khami]], capital of the Torwa State]]
[[Khami]] was the capital of the [[Torwa State]] and the successor of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. The techniques of Great Zimbabwe were further refined and developed. Elaborate walls were constructed by connecting carefully cut stones forming terraced hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Shillington| first = Kevin| title = History of Africa, Revised 2nd Edition| year = 2005| publisher = Palgrave MacMillan| isbn = 978-0-333-59957-0| page = 151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sotho-Tswana====
[[Sotho–Tswana peoples|Sotho/Tswana]] architecture represent the other stone building tradition of southern Africa, centered in the transvaal, highveld north and south of the Vaal. Numerous large stonewalled enclosures and stoned housed foundations have been found in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Shillington| first = Kevin| title = History of Africa, Revised 2nd Edition| year = 2005| publisher = Palgrave MacMillan| isbn = 978-0-333-59957-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital [[Molokweni]] of the [[Kwena]] (Tswana) was a stoned wall town as large as the [[Eastern Lunda]] capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Iliffe| first = John| title = Africans The History of a Continent| year = 2007| isbn = 978-0-521-68297-8| page = 122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zulu and Nguni====
[[Zulu Architecture]] was constructed with more perishable materials. Dome shaped huts typically comes to mind when one thinks of [[Zulu people|Zulu]] dwellings, but later on it evolved into dome over cylinder shape walls. [[Zulu people|Zulu]] capitals were elliptical in shape. The exterior was lined with durable wood palisade. Domed huts in rows of 6 through 8 lined the interior of exterior palisades. In the center of the capital city was the kraal, used by the king to examine his soldiers, holding cattle, or ceremonies. It was an empty circular area at the center of the capital, lined with less durable palisades compared to the exterior palisades. The entrance of the city was opposite to the highly fortified Royal Enclosure called the Isigodlo.  This was the general makeup of [[Zulu people|Zulu]] capitals [[UmGungundlovu|Mgungundlovu]] (King [[Dingane]]'s capital) and [[Ulundi]] (King [[Cetshwayo]]'s capital).

====Madagascar====
{{Main|Architecture of Madagascar}}

[[File:Mix of architectural materials in Antananarivo 1905.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Architecture in Antananarivo, Madagascar, 1905.]]
The Southeast Asian origins of the first settlers of Madagascar are reflected in the island's architecture, typified by rectangular dwellings topped with a peaked roof and often built on short stilts. The more East African Coastal dwellings are generally made of plant materials, while those of the central Highlands tend to be constructed in cob or brick. The introduction of brick-making in the 19th century by European missionaries led to the emergence of a distinctly Malagasy architectural style that blends the norms of traditional wooden aristocratic homes with European details.&lt;ref&gt;Acquier, Jean-Louis.  Architectures de Madagascar.  Paris: Berger-Levrault.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Namibia====
'''||Khauxa!nas''' was a wall construct in southeastern [[Namibia]] built by [[Oorlam]] (Khoi). Its perimeter was 700 m and 2 metres in height. It was built with stone slabs and displays features of both the Zimbabwean and Transvaal Free State style of stone construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Description of the Site&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Tracy| first = James D.| title = City Walls The Urban Enceinte in Global Perspective| year = 2000| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-65221-6| page = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern architecture==
[[File:Fasilides Palace 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fasiledes's castle, [[Fasil Ghebbi]], [[Gondar]].]]
During the early modern period, the absorption of new diverse influences such as Baroque, Arab, Turkish and Gujarati Indian style began with the arrival of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries in the 16th and 17th centuries. Portuguese soldiers had initially come in the mid-16th century as allies to aid Ethiopia in [[Ethiopian-Adal War|its fight against Adal]], and later Jesuits came hoping to convert the country. Some Turkish influence may have entered the country during the late 16th century during its war with the Ottoman Empire (see [[Habesh]]), which resulted in an increased building of fortresses and castles. Ethiopia, naturally hard to defensible because of its numerous [[amba (geology)|amba]]s or flat-topped mountains and rugged terrain, yielded little tactical use from the structures in contrast to their advantages in the flat terrain of Europe and other areas, and so had until this point little developed the tradition. Castles were built especially beginning with the reign of [[Sarsa Dengel]] around the [[Lake Tana]] region, and subsequent Emperors maintained the tradition, eventually resulting in the creation of the [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (royal enclosure of castles) in the newly founded capital (1635), [[Gondar]]. Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Susenyos]] (r.1606-1632) converted to Catholicism in 1622 and attempted to make it the state religion, declaring it as such from 1624 until his abdication; during this time, he employed Arab, Gujarati (brought by the Jesuits), and Jesuit masons and their styles, as well as local masons, some of whom were [[Beta Israel]]. With the reign of his son [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]], most of these foreigners were expelled, although some of their architectural styles were absorbed into the prevailing Ethiopian architectural style. This style of the Gondarine dynasty would persist throughout the 17th and 18th centuries especially and also influenced modern 19th-century styles and later.

Early European colonies developed around the [[West Africa]]n coast, building large [[Fortification|fort]]s, as can be seen at [[Elmina Castle]], [[Cape Coast Castle]], [[Osu Castle|Christiansborg]], [[Fort Jesus]] and elsewhere.  These were usually plain, with little ornament, but showing more internal creativity at [[Dixcove Fort]]. Other embellishments were gradually accreted, with the style inspiring later buildings such as [[Lamu Fort]] and the [[Stone Palace]] of [[Kumasi]].

By the late 19th century, most buildings reflected the fashionable European [[eclecticism]] and pastisched Mediterranean, or even Northern European, styles. Examples of colonial towns from this era survive at [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]], [[Grand-Bassam]], [[Swakopmund]] in [[Namibia]], [[Cape Town]] in [[South Africa]], [[Luanda]] in [[Angola]] and elsewhere. A few buildings were [[pre-fabricated]] in Europe and shipped over for erection. This European tradition continued well into the 20th century with the construction of European-style [[manor house]]s, such as [[Shiwa Ng'andu]] in what is now [[Zambia]], or the [[Boer]] homesteads in [[South Africa]], and with many town buildings.

The revival of interest in traditional styles can be traced to [[Cairo]] in the early 19th century. This had spread to [[Algiers]] and [[Morocco]] by the early 20th century, from which time colonial buildings across the continent began to pastiche elements of traditional African architecture, the [[Jamia Mosque (Kenya)|Jamia Mosque]] in [[Nairobi]] being a typical example. In some cases, architects attempted to mix local and European styles, such as at [[Bagamoyo]].

The effect of [[modern architecture]] began to be felt in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Le Corbusier]] designed several unbuilt schemes for [[Algeria]], including ones for [[Nemours]] and for the reconstruction of [[Algiers]].  Elsewhere, [[Steffen Ahrens]] was active in South Africa, and [[Ernst May]] in Nairobi and [[Mombasa]].

The Italian [[futurist architecture|futurists]] saw [[Asmara]] as an opportunity to build their designs.  Planned villages were constructed in [[Libya]] and [[Italian East Africa]], including the new town of [[Tripoli]], all utilising modern designs.

After 1945, [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]] extended their work on British schools into [[Ghana]], and also designed the [[University of Ibadan]]. The reconstruction of Algiers offered more opportunities, with [[Algiers Cathedral]], and universities by [[Oscar Niemeyer]], [[Kenzo Tange]], [[Zwiefel]] and [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]]. But modern architecture in this sense largely remained the preserve of European architects until the 1960s, one notable exception being [[Le Groupe Transvaal]] in South Africa, who built homes inspired by [[Walter Gropius]] and Le Corbusier.

A number of new cities were built following the end of [[colonialism]], while others were greatly expanded. Perhaps the best known example is that of [[Abidjan]], where the majority of buildings were still designed by high-profile non-African architects. In [[Yamoussoukro]], the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro]] is an example of a desire for monumentality in these new cities, but [[Arch 22]] in the old [[The Gambia|Gambia]]n capital of [[Banjul]] displays the same bravado.

Experimental designs have also appeared, most notably the [[Eastgate Centre, Harare]] in Zimbabwe. With an advanced form of natural air-conditioning, this building was designed to respond precisely to Harare's climate and needs, rather than import less suitable designs.  Neo-[[vernacular architecture]] continues, for instance with the [[Great Mosque of Nioro]] or [[New Gourna]].

Other notable structures of recent years have been some of the world's largest [[dam]]s. The [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] and [[Akosombo Dam]] hold back the world's largest [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]]. In recent years, there has also been renewed [[bridge]] building in many nations, while the [[Trans-Gabon Railway]] is perhaps the last of the great railways to be constructed.

The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] at Shatby, Egypt—a large airy spacious regional public library, built overlooking the Mediterranean—completed in 2001 and designed by Snøhetta, in association with Hamza Associates of Cairo, is a good example of a modern granite-cladding construction. A commemoration of the [[Library of Alexandria]], once the largest library in the world but destroyed in antiquity, the new Library's architecture is ultramodern and very non-traditional.
