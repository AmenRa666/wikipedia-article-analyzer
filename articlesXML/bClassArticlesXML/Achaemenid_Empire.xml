It is equally notable for its successful model of a centralised, bureaucratic administration (through [[satrap]]s under the [[King of Kings]]), for building infrastructure such as a [[Chapar Khaneh|postal system]] and [[Royal Road|road systems]] and the use of an [[official language]] across its territories and a large professional army and civil services (inspiring similar systems in later empires).&lt;ref name=schmitt-EI-i&gt;[[#refachaemenids-EI|Schmitt]] Achaemenid dynasty (i.

The delegation of power to local governments is thought to have eventually weakened the king's authority, causing resources to be expended in attempts to subdue local rebellions, and leading to the disunity of the region at the time of [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[wars of Alexander the Great|invasion]] in 334 BC.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; This viewpoint, however, is challenged by some modern scholars who argue that the Achaemenid Empire was not facing any such crisis around the time of Alexander, and that only internal succession struggles within the Achaemenid family ever came close to weakening the empire.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; Alexander, an avid admirer of Cyrus the Great,&lt;ref name=Ulrich&gt;{{cite book| author = Ulrich Wilcken| title = Alexander the Great| url = https://books.google.com/?id=WiSZM-LYsk4C| year = 1967| publisher = W.

Upon his death most of the empire's former territory came under the rule of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] and [[Seleucid Empire]], in addition to other minor territories which gained independence at that time. The Persian population of the central plateau would eventually reclaim power by the second century BC under the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

The historical mark of the Achaemenid Empire went far beyond its territorial and military influences and included cultural, social, technological and religious influences as well. Many [[Athens|Athenians]] adopted Achaemenid customs in their daily lives in a reciprocal cultural exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Margaret Christina Miller| title = Athens and Persia in the Fifth Century BC: A Study in Cultural Receptivity| url = https://books.google.com/?id=oGXMMD5rXBQC| year = 2004| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-60758-2| page = 243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some being employed by, or allied to the Persian kings. The impact of [[Cyrus's edict]] is mentioned in Judeo-Christian texts and the empire was instrumental in the spread of [[Zoroastrianism]] as far east as [[China]]. The Empire would also set the tone for the politics, heritage and history of modern Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Birth of the Persian Empire|author1=Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis |author2=Sarah Stewart |publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2005|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a0IF9IdkdYEC&amp;pg=PA7|isbn=978-1-84511-062-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The maussolleion model dsc02711-miniaturk nevit.jpg|thumb|The [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], one of the [[Seven wonders of the ancient world]], was built by Greek architects for the local Persian [[satrap]] of [[Caria]], [[Mausolus]] (Scale model)]]

The Achaemenid Empire was created by nomadic [[Persian people|Persians]]. The name &quot;Persia&quot; is a Greek and [[Latin]] pronunciation of the native word referring to people originating from Persis (or in Persian, [[Fars Province|Pars]]), their home territory located north of the [[Persian Gulf]] in southwestern [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite book| author = Jamie Stokes| title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Volume 1| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Rtr7MQEACAAJ| year = 2009| publisher = Infobase Publishing| isbn = 978-0-8160-7158-6| pages = 2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its success and rapid expansion, the Achaemenid Empire was not the first Iranian empire, as by 6th century BC another group of ancient [[Iranian peoples]] had already established the Median Empire.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; The [[Medes]] had originally been the dominant Iranian group in the region, rising to power at the end of the seventh century BC and incorporating the Persians into their empire. The Iranian people had arrived in the region c. 1000 BC&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J.P. (1989), In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology, and Myth, London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; and had initially fallen under the domination of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–609 BC). However, the Medes and Persians (together with the [[Scythians]] and [[Babylonia]]ns) played a major role in the defeat of the Assyrians and establishment of the first Persian empire.

The term Achaemenid is in fact the [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] version of the Old Persian name ''Haxāmaniš'' (a [[bahuvrihi]] compound translating to &quot;having a friend's mind&quot;&lt;ref name=schlerath&gt;[[#refschlerath|Schlerath]] p. 36, no. 9. See also [[#refjtavernier|Iranica in the Achaemenid Period]] p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;), meaning in Greek &quot;of the family of the Achaemenis.&quot; Despite the derivation of the name, [[Achaemenes]] was himself a minor seventh-century ruler of the [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]] (''Ansham'' or ''Anšān'') in southwestern Iran.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; It was not until the time of [[Cyrus the Great]] (Cyrus II of Persia), a descendant of Achaemenes, that the Achaemenid Empire developed the prestige of an empire and set out to incorporate the existing empires of the ancient east, becoming the vast Persian Empire of ancient legend.

At some point in 550 BC, Cyrus rose in rebellion against the Medes (most likely due to their mismanagement of Persis), eventually conquering the Medes and creating the first Persian empire. Cyrus the Great utilized his tactical genius,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Simon Anglim|author2=Simon Anglim|author3=Phyllis Jestice|author4=Scott Rusch|author5= John Serrati| title = Fighting techniques of the ancient world 3,000 BC – 500 CE: equipment, combat skills, and tactics| url = https://books.google.com/?id=HL9cPgAACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-30932-9| page = 145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his understanding of the socio-political conditions governing his territories, to eventually incorporate into the Empire neighbouring Lydia and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, also leading the way for his successor, [[Cambyses II]], to venture into Egypt and defeat the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt]].

Cyrus the Great's political acumen was reflected in his management of his newly formed empire, as the Persian Empire became the first to attempt to govern many different ethnic groups on the principle of equal responsibilities and rights for all people, so long as subjects paid their taxes and kept the peace.&lt;ref name=cyv&gt;{{cite book| author = Palmira Johnson Brummett |author2=Robert R. Edgar |author3=Neil J. Hackett|author4=Robert R. Edgar|author5=Neil J. Hackett| title = Civilization past &amp; present, Volume 1| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Vz65MAm_6JMC| year = 2003| publisher = Longman| isbn = 978-0-321-09097-3| page = 38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the king agreed not to interfere with the local customs, religions, and trades of its subject states,&lt;ref name=cyv/&gt; a unique quality that eventually won Cyrus the support of the Babylonians. This system of management ultimately became an issue for the Persians, as with a larger empire came the need for order and control, leading to expenditure of resources and mobilization of troops to quell local rebellions, and weakening the central power of the king. By the time of [[Darius III]], this disorganization had almost led to a disunited realm.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

The Persians from whom Cyrus hailed were originally [[nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralists]] in the western Iranian Plateau and by 850 BC were calling themselves the ''Parsa'' and their constantly shifting territory ''Parsua'', for the most part localized around Persis.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; As Persians gained power, they developed the infrastructure to support their growing influence, including creation of a capital named [[Pasargadae]] and an opulent city named [[Persepolis]].

Begun during the rule of [[Darius I]] &quot;the Great&quot; and completed some 100 years later,&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite book| author = Charles Gates| title = Ancient cities: the archaeology of urban life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome| url = https://books.google.com/?id=8aLb5pnm1j4C| year = 2003| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-12182-8| page = 186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Persepolis was a symbol of the empire serving both as a ceremonial centre and a center of government.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; It had a special set of gradually progressive stairways named &quot;All Countries&quot;&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; around which carved relief decoration depicted scenes of heroism, hunting, natural themes, and presentation of the gifts to the Achaemenid kings by their subjects during the spring festival, [[Nowruz]]. The core structure was composed of a multitude of square rooms or halls, the biggest of which was called ''[[Apadana]]''.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; Tall, decorated columns welcomed visitors and emphasized the height of the structure. Later on, Darius also utilized [[Susa]] and [[Ecbatana]] as his governmental centres, developing them to a similar metropolitan status.

Accounts of the [[Achaemenid family tree]] can be derived from either documented Greek or Roman accounts, or from existing documented Persian accounts such as those found in the [[Behistun Inscription]]. However, since most existing accounts of this vast empire are in works of Greek philosophers and historians, and since many of the original Persian documents are lost, not to mention being subject to varying scholarly views on their origin and possible motivations behind them, it is difficult to create a definitive and completely objective list. Nonetheless, it is clear that Cyrus and Darius were critical in the expansion of the empire. Cyrus is often believed to be the son of [[Cambyses I]], grandson of [[Cyrus I]], the father of [[Cambyses II]], and a relative of Darius through a shared ancestor, [[Teispes]]. Cyrus the Great is also believed to have been a family member (possibly grandson) of the Median king [[Astyages]] through his mother, [[Mandane of Media]]. A minority of scholars argue that perhaps Achaemenes was a retrograde creation of Darius in order to reconcile his connection with Cyrus after gaining power.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] writers provide some legendary information about [[Achaemenes]] by calling his tribe the ''Pasargadae'' and stating that he was &quot;raised by an [[eagle]]&quot;. [[Plato]], when writing about the Persians, identified Achaemenes with [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], ancestor of the Persians in [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = David Sacks |author2=Oswyn Murray |author3=Lisa R. Brody|author4=Oswyn Murray|author5=Lisa R.

Later writers believed that Achaemenes and Perseus were different people, and that Perses was an ancestor of the king.&lt;ref name=dandamayev&gt;[[#refachaemenes-EI|Dandamayev]]&lt;/ref&gt; This account further confirms that Achaemenes could well have been a significant Anshan leader and an ancestor of Cyrus the Great. Regardless, both Cyrus the Great and Darius the Great were related, prominent kings of Persia, under whose rule the empire expanded to include much of the ancient world.

The empire took its unified form with a central administration around [[Pasargadae]] erected by [[Cyrus the Great]]. The empire ended up conquering and enlarging the Median Empire to include in addition many more territories, for example in [[Europe]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Egypt]], and [[Central Asia]]. During the reigns of [[Darius I]] and his son [[Xerxes I]] it engaged in military conflict with some of the major city-states of [[Ancient Greece]], and although it came close to defeating the Greek army, this war ultimately led to the empire's overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Haydn Middleton|title = Ancient Greek War and Weapons|url = https://books.google.com/?id=RNhPuKAEva0C|date = 2 October 2002|publisher = Haydn Middleton|isbn = 978-1-4034-0134-2|pages = 12–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 559 BC, [[Cambyses I]] the Elder was succeeded as the king of Anšān by his son [[Cyrus The Great|Cyrus the Great]], who also succeeded the still-living [[Arsames]] as the King of Persia, thus reuniting the two realms. Cyrus is considered to be the first true king of the Persian Empire, as his predecessors were subservient to the [[Medes]]. Cyrus the Great conquered Media, Lydia, and [[Babylon]]. Cyrus was politically shrewd, modeling himself as the &quot;savior&quot; of conquered nations, often allowing displaced people to return, and giving his subjects freedom to practice local customs. To reinforce this image, he instituted policies of religious freedom, and restored temples and other infrastructure in the newly acquired cities (Most notably the [[Jewish]] inhabitants of Babylon, as recorded in the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] and the [[Tanakh]]). As a result of his tolerant policies he came to be known by those of the Jewish faith as &quot;the anointed of the Lord.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Lawrence Heyworth Mills|title = Zarathustra, Philo, the Achaemenids and Israel|url = https://books.google.com/?id=uU8XAAAAYAAJ|year = 1906|publisher = Open Court|page = 467 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isaiah 45:1–7 (Passage)|publisher=Bible gateway (New International Version)|year=2010|accessdate=26 December 2010|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+45%3A1-7&amp;version=NIV#en-NIV-18564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His immediate successors were less successful. Cyrus' son [[Cambyses II]] conquered Egypt in 525 BC, but died in July 522 BC during a revolt led by a sacerdotal clan that had lost its power following Cyrus' conquest of Media. The cause of his death remains uncertain, although it may have been the result of an accident.&lt;ref name=camb&gt;{{cite book|author = Maria Brosius|title = The Persians: an introduction|url = https://books.google.com/?id=9vnCeA_Z73cC|year = 2006|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn = 978-0-415-32089-4|pages = 13 (at the bottom of the page) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herodotus]], Cambyses II had originally ventured into Egypt to take revenge for the pharaoh Amasis's trickery when he sent a fake Egyptian bride whose family Amasis had murdered,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1uQaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Herodotus+Amasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a0o0Tb-HMdDegQfu64niCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Herodotus%20Amasis&amp;f=false Herodotus – Volume 1, Book II]&lt;/ref&gt; instead of his own daughter, to wed Cambyses II. Additionally negative reports of mistreatment caused by Amasis, given by [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]], a wise counsellor serving Amasis, further bolstered Cambyses's resolve to venture into Egypt. Amasis died before Cambyses II could face him, but his successor [[Psamtik III]] was defeated by Cambyses II in the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|Battle of Pelusium]].

While Cambyses II was in Egypt, the Zoroastrian priests, whom Herodotus called [[Magi]], usurped the throne for one of their own, [[Gaumata]], who then pretended to be Cambyses II's younger brother [[Bardiya]] (Greek: ''Smerdis'' or ''Tanaoxares/Tanyoxarkes''&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;), who had been assassinated some three years earlier. Owing to the strict rule of Cambyses II, especially his stance on taxation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Augustus William Ahl|title = Outline of Persian history based on cuneiform inscriptions|url = https://books.google.com/?id=OwduAAAAMAAJ|year = 1922| publisher = Lemcke &amp; Buechner|page = 56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his long absence in Egypt, &quot;the whole people, Perses, Medes and all the other nations,&quot; acknowledged the usurper, especially as he granted a remission of taxes for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus III.68&lt;/ref&gt; Cambyses II himself would not be able to quell the imposters, as he died on the way back from Egypt.

The claim that [[Gaumata]] had impersonated Bardiya (Smerdis), is derived from Darius the Great and the records at the [[Behistun Inscription]]. Historians are divided over the possibility that the story of the impostor was invented by Darius as justification for his coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9068262/Smerdis|title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Concise.britannica.com|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darius made a similar claim when he later captured Babylon, announcing that the Babylonian king was not, in fact, Nebuchadnezzar III, but an impostor named Nidintu-bel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering|url=http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nidintu-bel/nidintubel.htm|title=Nidintu-Bêl / Nebuchadnezzar III|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=7 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100714195400/http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nidintu-bel/nidintubel.htm| archivedate= 14 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Behistun Inscription]], Gaumata ruled for seven months before being overthrown in 522 BC by [[Darius the Great]] (Darius I) (Old Persian ''Dāryavuš'', &quot;who holds firm the good&quot;, also known as ''Darayarahush'' or Darius the Great). The Magi, though persecuted, continued to exist, and a year following the death of the first pseudo-Smerdis (Gaumata), saw a second pseudo-Smerdis (named Vahyazdāta) attempt a coup. The coup, though initially successful, failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Herodotus| title = Herodotus: the text of Canon Rawlinson's translation, with the notes abridged, Volume 1| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Xe_fAAAAMAAJ| year = 1897| publisher = C. Scribner's| page = 278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] writes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herodotus|title=The Histories Book 3.80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the native leadership debated the best form of government for the empire. It was agreed that an [[oligarchy]] would divide them against one another, and democracy would bring about [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]] resulting in a charismatic leader resuming the monarchy. Therefore, they decided a new monarch was in order, particularly since ''they'' were in a position to choose him. Darius I was chosen monarch from among the leaders. He was cousin to Cambyses II and Bardiya (Smerdis), claiming [[Ariaramnes]] as his ancestor.

The Achaemenids thereafter consolidated areas firmly under their control. It was [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Darius the Great]] who, by sound and farsighted administrative planning, brilliant military maneuvering, and a humanistic world view, established the greatness of the Achaemenids and, in less than thirty years, raised them from an obscure tribe to a world power. It was during the reign of Darius the Great (Darius I) that [[Persepolis]] was built (518–516 BC) and which would serve as capital for several generations of Achaemenid kings. [[Ecbatana]] (''Hagmatāna'' &quot;City of Gatherings&quot;, modern: [[Hamadan]]) in Media was greatly expanded during this period and served as the summer capital.

Ever since the [[Macedon]]ian king [[Amyntas I]] surrendered his country to the Persians in about 512-511, Macedonians and Persians were strangers no more as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot;&gt;Joseph Roisman,Ian Worthington [https://books.google.nl/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;dq=Achaemenid+Persians+ruled+balkans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K7qasgPG1K&amp;sig=lkiajbVuNcHEbI5Lz3MnvIUBG1U&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sb6RVP2qHoPUaqeGgZgE&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Achaemenid%20Persians%20ruled%20balkans&amp;f=false ''A Companion to Ancient Macedonia'']. pp.&amp;nbsp;342–345.

The Balkans provided many soldiers for the multi-ethnic Achaemenid army. Many of the Macedonian and Persian elite intermarried, such as the Persian official [[Bubares]] who married Amyntas' daughter, Gygaea. Family ties the Macedonian rulers Amyntas and Alexander enjoyed with Bubares ensured them good relations with the Persian kings Darius and [[Xerxes I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot;/&gt; The Persian invasion led indirectly to Macedonia's rise in power and Persia had some common interests in the Balkans; with Persian aid, the Macedonians stood to gain much at the expense of some Balkan tribes such as the Paeonians and Greeks. All in all, the Macedonians were &quot;willing and useful Persian allies. Macedonian soldiers fought against Athens and [[Sparta]] in Xerxes' army.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot;/&gt; The Persians referred to both Greeks and Macedonians as ''[[Yona|Yauna]]'' (&quot;[[Ionian Greeks|Ionians]]&quot;, their term for &quot;Greeks&quot;), and to Macedonians specifically as ''Yaunã Takabara'' or &quot;Greeks with hats that look like shields&quot;, possibly referring to the Macedonian [[kausia]] hat.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Engels, &quot;Ch. 5: Macedonians and Greeks&quot;, In: Roisman and Worthington, &quot;A companion to Ancient Macedonia&quot;, p. 87.

By the 5th century BC the Kings of Persia were either ruling over or had subordinated territories encompassing not just all of the [[Persian Plateau]] and all of the territories formerly held by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empire]] ([[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Persian Egypt|Egypt]]), but beyond this all of [[Anatolia]] and [[Armenia]], as well as the [[Southern Caucasus]] and parts of the [[North Caucasus]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], all of [[Bulgaria]], [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to the north and west, most of the [[Black Sea]] coastal regions, parts of [[Central Asia]] as far as the [[Aral Sea]], the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] and [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] to the north and north-east, the [[Hindu Kush]] and the western [[Indus River|Indus basin]] (corresponding to modern Afghanistan and [[Pakistan]]) to the far east, parts of northern [[Arabia]] to the south, and parts of northern [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] to the south-west, and parts of [[Oman]], China, and the [[UAE]].&lt;ref name=&quot;livius.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;behi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dagestan|title=DĀḠESTĀN|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=riW0kKzat2sC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=achaemenid+empire+abkhazia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3DhquWsEHk&amp;sig=DyVTtj6kmXbh-nRenyOpbAnLisM&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wPOgVNqFB8y8UYKmgLAL&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=achaemenid%20empire%20abkhazia&amp;f=false|title=The Making of the Georgian Nation|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;c_ramirez-faria&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Ramirez-Faria| first = Carlos| title = Concise Encyclopeida Of World History| url = https://books.google.com/?id=gGKsS-9h4BYC| accessdate = October 7, 2012| year = 2007| publisher = Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist| isbn = 81-269-0775-4| page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Persian Empire: A Corpus of Sources from the Achaemenid Period |last=Kuhrt |first=Amélie |authorlink=Amélie Kuhrt |year=2007 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=1-134-07634-7 |page=2 |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S6BevAUWSGAC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Achaemenid+Empire+Jordan#v=onepage&amp;q=Achaemenid%20Empire%20Jordan&amp;f=false}}. {{cite book| last = O'Brien| first = Patrick| title = Concise Atlas of World History| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ffZy5tDjaUkC| accessdate = October 7, 2012| year = 2002| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| isbn = 0-19-521921-X| page = 43 }}. {{cite book| title = Forgotten Empire: The World of Ancient Persia| year = 2005| publisher = [[University of California Press]]| isbn = 0-520-24731-0| page = 47| first1 = John E.| first2 = Nigel| last1 = Curtis| last2 = Tallis }}. {{cite book| author = Facts On File, Incorporated| title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East| url = https://books.google.com/?id=stl97FdyRswC| accessdate = October 7, 2012| year = 2009| publisher = [[Infobase Publishing]]| isbn = 1-4381-2676-X| page = 60 }}. {{cite book| last = Parker| first = Grant| title = The Making of Roman India| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ahMXbSFxGhUC| accessdate = October 7, 2012| year = 2008| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn = 0-521-85834-8| page = 13 }}. {{cite book| last = Thapar| first = Romila| authorlink = Romila Thapar| title = Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300| url = https://books.google.com/?id=-5irrXX0apQC| accessdate = October 7, 2012| year = 2004| publisher = [[University of California Press]]| isbn = 0-520-24225-4| page = 157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greek-Persian duel.jpg|thumb|Greek [[hoplite]] and Persian warrior depicted fighting, on an ancient [[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], 5th century BC]]

The [[Ionian Revolt]] in 499 BC, and associated revolts in Aeolis, Doris, Cyprus and Caria, were military rebellions by several regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule, lasting from 499 to 493 BC. At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them, along with the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants, [[Histiaeus]] and [[Aristagoras]]. In 499 BC, the then tyrant of [[Miletus]], Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]], in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus (both financially and in terms of prestige). The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great.

The Persians continued to reduce the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement in 493 BC on Ionia that was generally considered to be both just and fair. The [[Ionian Revolt]] constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Achaemenid Empire, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, but Darius had vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Willis Mason West| title = The ancient world from the earliest times to 800 CE| url = https://books.google.com/?id=168XAAAAIAAJ| year = 1904| publisher = Allyn and Bacon| page = 137| quote = The Athenian support was particularly troubling to Darius since he had come to their aid during their conflict with Sparta }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, seeing that the political situation in Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, he decided to embark on the conquest of all of Greece. The first campaign of the invasion was to bring the territories in the [[Balkan]] peninsula back within the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;A companion to Ancient Macedonia&quot;&gt;Joseph Roisman,Ian Worthington.

ISBN 1-4443-5163-X pp&amp;nbsp;135–138, pp&amp;nbsp;343–345&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian grip over these territories had loosened following the Ionian Revolt. In 492 BC, the Persian general [[Mardonius]] re-subjugated [[Thrace]] and made [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] a fully [[subordinate]] part of the empire; it had been a vassal as early as the late 6th century BC, but retained a great deal of autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;A companion to Ancient Macedonia&quot;/&gt; However, in 490 BC the Persian forces were defeated by the Athenians at the [[Battle of Marathon]] and Darius would die before having the chance to launch an invasion of Greece.

[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|left|300px|Map showing events of the first phases of the Greco-Persian Wars]]
[[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]] (485–465 BC, Old Persian ''Xšayārša'' &quot;Hero Among Kings&quot;), son of [[Darius I]], vowed to complete the job. He organized a massive invasion aiming to conquer [[Greece]]. His army entered Greece from the north, meeting little or no resistance through [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Thessaly]], but was delayed by a small Greek force for three days at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]]. A simultaneous naval battle at Artemisium was tactically indecisive as large storms destroyed ships from both sides. The battle was stopped prematurely when the Greeks received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. The battle was a strategic victory for the Persians, giving them uncontested control of Artemisium and the Aegean Sea.

Following his victory at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], Xerxes sacked the evacuated city of [[Athens]] and prepared to meet the Greeks at the strategic [[Isthmus of Corinth]] and the [[Saronic Gulf]]. In 480 BC the Greeks won a decisive victory over the Persian fleet at the [[Battle of Salamis]] and forced Xerxes to retire to [[Sardis]]. The land army which he left in Greece under [[Mardonius]] retook Athens but was eventually destroyed in 479 BC at the [[Battle of Plataea]]. The final defeat of the Persians at [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]] encouraged the Greek cities of Asia to revolt, and the Persians lost all of their territories in Europe; Macedonia once again became independent.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot;/&gt;

===Cultural phase===
[[File:Cyrus II le Grand et les Hébreux.jpg|thumb|200px|Cyrus the Great king of Iran (ancient Persia) liberated the [[Hebrew]] [[Babylonian captivity|captives in Babylon]] to resettle and rebuild [[Jerusalem]], earning him an honored place in Judaism.]]
After [[Xerxes I]] was assassinated, he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Artaxerxes I]]. It was during his reign that [[Elamite]] ceased to be the language of government, and Aramaic gained in importance. It was probably during this reign that the solar calendar was introduced as the national calendar. Under Artaxerxes I, [[Zoroastrianism]] became the ''de facto'' religion of state, and for this Artaxerxes I is today also known as the [[Constantine I|Constantine]] of that faith.

After Persia had been defeated at [[Battle of Eurymedon]] (469 BC), military action between Greece and Persia was halted. When Artaxerxes&amp;nbsp;I took power, he introduced a new Persian strategy of weakening the Athenians by funding their enemies in Greece. This indirectly caused the Athenians to move the treasury of the [[Delian League]] from the island of [[Delos]] to the Athenian acropolis. This funding practice inevitably prompted renewed fighting in 450&amp;nbsp;BC, where the Greeks attacked at the [[Battle of Salamis in Cyprus (450&amp;nbsp;BC)|Battle of Cyprus]]. After [[Cimon]]'s failure to attain much in this expedition, the [[Peace of Callias]] was agreed between [[Athens]], [[Argos]] and [[Persia]] in 449&amp;nbsp;BC.

Artaxerxes&amp;nbsp;I offered [[Political asylum|asylum]] to [[Themistocles]], who was the winner of the [[Battle of Salamis]], after Themistocles was [[ostracized]] from [[Athens]]. Also, Artaxerxes I gave him [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]], [[Myus]], and [[Lampsacus]] to maintain him in bread, meat, and wine. In addition, Artaxerxes I gave him [[Palaescepsis]] to provide him with clothes, and he also gave him [[Percote]] with bedding for his house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plutarch.classicauthors.net/PlutarchsLives/PlutarchsLives3.html Themistocles, Part II], by [[Plutarch]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Artaxerxes died in 424 BC at [[Susa]], his body was taken to the tomb already built for him in the [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] Necropolis. It was Persian tradition that kings begin constructing their own tombs while they were still alive. Artaxerxes I was immediately succeeded by his eldest son [[Xerxes II]], who was the only legitimate son of Artaxerxes.{{sfn|Kuhrt|2013|page=880}} However, after a few days on the throne, he was assassinated while drunk by Pharnacyas and Menostanes on the orders of his illegitimate brother: [[Sogdianus]]  who apparently had gained the support of his regions. He reigned for six months and fifteen days before being captured by his half-brother, [[Darius II|Ochus]], who had rebelled against him. Sogdianus was executed by being [[Suffocation in ash|suffocated in ash]] because Ochus had promised he would not die by the sword, by poison or by hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kitto|first= J|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR98-IA43|title=Palestine: the Bible History of the holy land|publisher= London|year= 1841| page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ochus then took the royal name Darius II. Darius' ability to defend his position on the throne ended the short power vacuum.

From 412 BC [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]], at the insistence of [[Tissaphernes]], gave support first to Athens, then to Sparta, but in 407 BC, Darius' son [[Cyrus the Younger]] was appointed to replace Tissaphernes and aid was given entirely to Sparta which finally defeated Athens in 404 BC. In the same year, Darius fell ill and died in Babylon. His death gave an Egyptian rebel named [[Amyrtaeus]] the opportunity to throw off [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Persian control over Egypt]]. At his death bed, Darius' Babylonian wife [[Parysatis]] pleaded with him to have her second eldest son Cyrus (the Younger) crowned, but Darius refused. Queen Parysatis favoured Cyrus more than her eldest son [[Artaxerxes II]]. [[Plutarch]] relates (probably on the authority of [[Ctesias]]) that the displaced Tissaphernes came to the new king on his coronation day to warn him that his younger brother Cyrus (the Younger) was preparing to assassinate him during the ceremony. Artaxerxes had Cyrus arrested and would have had him executed if their mother Parysatis had not intervened. Cyrus was then sent back as Satrap of Lydia, where he prepared an armed rebellion. Cyrus hired an army of [[Ten Thousand Greek mercenaries]] and made his way deeper into Persia. The army of Cyrus was stopped by the royal Persian army of [[Artaxerxes II]] at [[Battle of Cunaxa|Cunaxa]] in 401 BC, where Cyrus was killed. The [[Ten Thousand Greek Mercenaries]] including [[Xenophon]] were now deep in Persian territory and were at risk of attack. So they searched for others to offer their services to but eventually had to return to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Whittemore Mather (ed.), Joseph William Hewitt (ed.), [[Xenophon]]: ''Anabasis, Books 1–4''. University of Oklahoma Press, 1979, ISBN 978-0-8061-1347-0, p. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=dQltw0UIC2UC&amp;pg=PA44 44]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artaxerxes II]] was the longest reigning of the Achaemenid kings and it was during this 45-year period of relative peace and stability that many of the monuments of the era were constructed. Artaxerxes moved the capital back to [[Persepolis]], which he greatly extended. Also the summer capital at [[Ecbatana]] was lavishly extended with gilded columns and roof tiles of silver and copper.&lt;ref&gt;(Polybius, 27 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The extraordinary innovation of the Zoroastrian shrines can also be dated to his reign, and it was probably during this period that Zoroastrianism spread from [[Armenia]] throughout [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]. The construction of temples, though serving a religious purpose, was not a purely selfless act, as they also served as an important source of income. From the Babylonian kings, the Achaemenids had taken over the concept of a mandatory temple tax, a one-tenth tithe which all inhabitants paid to the temple nearest to their land or other source of income.&lt;ref&gt;(Dandamaev &amp; Lukonin, 1989:361–362)&lt;/ref&gt; A share of this income called the ''Quppu Sha Sharri'', &quot;kings chest&quot;—an ingenious institution originally introduced by [[Nabonidus]]—was then turned over to the ruler. In retrospect, Artaxerxes is generally regarded as an amiable man who lacked the moral fibre to be a really successful ruler. However, six centuries later [[Ardeshir I]], founder of the [[second Persian Empire]], would consider himself Artaxerxes' successor, a grand testimony to the importance of Artaxerxes to the Persian psyche.

[[File:Double daric 330-300 obverse CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Daric]] of Artaxerxes II]]
Artaxerxes II became involved in a war with Persia's erstwhile allies, the [[Sparta]]ns, who, under [[Agesilaus II]], invaded [[Asia Minor]]. In order to redirect the Spartans' attention to Greek affairs, Artaxerxes II subsidized their enemies: in particular the [[Athens|Athenians]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] and [[Corinth]]ians. These subsidies helped to engage the [[Sparta]]ns in what would become known as the [[Corinthian War]]. In 386 BC, Artaxerxes II betrayed his allies and came to an arrangement with Sparta, and in the [[Treaty of Antalcidas]] he forced his erstwhile allies to come to terms. This treaty restored control of the Greek cities of [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis]] on the Anatolian coast to the Persians, while giving Sparta dominance on the Greek mainland. In 385 BC he [[Artaxerxes' II Cadusian Campaign|campaigned against the Cadusians]]. Although successful against the Greeks, Artaxerxes II had more trouble with the [[Egypt]]ians, who had successfully revolted against him at the beginning of his reign.  An attempt to reconquer Egypt in 373 BC was completely unsuccessful, but in his waning years the Persians did manage to defeat a joint Egyptian–Spartan effort to conquer [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Phoenicia]]. He quashed the [[Revolt of the Satraps]] in 372–362 BC. He is reported to have had a number of wives. His main wife was [[Stateira (wife of Artaxerxes II)|Stateira]], until she was poisoned by Artaxerxes II's mother Parysatis in about 400 BC. Another chief wife was a Greek woman of [[Phocaea]] named Aspasia (not the same as the concubine of [[Pericles]]). Artaxerxes II is said to have more than 115 sons from 350 wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Achaemenid Empire|url = http://iranologie.com/the-history-page/the-achaemenid-empire/|accessdate = 2015-06-21}}[http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 358 BC Artaxerxes II died and was succeeded by his son [[Artaxerxes III]]. In 355 BC, Artaxerxes III forced [[Athens]] to conclude a peace which required the city's forces to leave [[Asia Minor]] and to acknowledge the independence of its rebellious allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/artaxerxes3.htm |title=Artaxerxes 3 |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |last=Kjeilen |first=Tore| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080225213722/http://lexicorient.com/e.o/artaxerxes3.htm| archivedate=25 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaxerxes started a campaign against the rebellious [[Cadusii|Cadusians]], but he managed to appease both of the Cadusian kings. One individual who successfully emerged from this campaign was Darius Codomannus, who later occupied the Persian throne as [[Darius III]].

Artaxerxes III then ordered the disbanding of all the satrapal armies of Asia Minor, as he felt that they could no longer guarantee peace in the west and was concerned that these armies equipped the western satraps with the means to revolt.&lt;ref name=&quot;PersianArmy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Persian Army 560–330 BC: 560–330 BC |last=Sekunda |first=Nick |author2=Nicholas V.

Athens sent assistance to [[Sardis]]. [[Orontid dynasty#Orontids Kings and satraps of Armenia|Orontes of Mysia]] also supported Artabazus and the combined forces managed to defeat the forces sent by Artaxerxes III in 354&amp;nbsp;BC. However, in 353&amp;nbsp;BC, they were defeated by Artaxerxes III's army and were disbanded. Orontes was pardoned by the king, while Artabazus fled to the safety of the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]]. In around 351 BC, Artaxerxes embarked on a campaign to recover Egypt, which had revolted under his father, Artaxerxes II. At the same time a rebellion had broken out in Asia Minor, which, being supported by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], threatened to become serious. Levying a vast army, Artaxerxes marched into Egypt, and engaged [[Nectanebo II]]. After a year of fighting the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]], Nectanebo inflicted a crushing defeat on the Persians with the support of mercenaries led by the Greek generals Diophantus and Lamius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Ancient Israel and Judah |last=Miller |first=James M. |others=John Haralson Hayes (photographer) |year=1986 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=0-664-21262-X |page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaxerxes was compelled to retreat and postpone his plans to reconquer Egypt. Soon after this defeat, there were rebellions in [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Phoenicia]], [[History of Anatolia#Achaemenid Empire|Asia Minor]] and [[Ancient history of Cyprus#Persian period|Cyprus]].
In 343&amp;nbsp;BC, Artaxerxes committed responsibility for the suppression of the Cyprian rebels to [[Idrieus]], prince of [[Caria]], who employed 8,000 Greek mercenaries and forty [[trireme]]s, commanded by [[Phocion]] the Athenian, and Evagoras, son of the elder [[Evagoras I|Evagoras]], the Cypriot monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Discoveries at Halicarnassus, Cnidus &amp; Branchidæ |last=Newton |first=Sir Charles Thomas |author2=R.P.

Artaxerxes initiated a counter-offensive against [[Sidon]] by commanding Belesys, satrap of Syria and Mezseus, [[Cilicia (satrapy)|satrap of Cilicia]] to invade the city and to keep the [[Phoenicia]]ns in check. Both satraps suffered crushing defeats at the hands of Tennes, the Sidonese king, who was aided by 40,000 Greek mercenaries sent to him by [[Nectanebo II]] and commanded by [[Mentor of Rhodes]]. As a result, the Persian forces were driven out of [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Persianempire&quot;/&gt;

After this, Artaxerxes personally led an army of 330,000 men against [[Sidon]]. Artaxerxes' army comprised 300,000 foot soldiers, 30,000 [[cavalry]], 300 triremes, and 500 transports or provision ships. After gathering this army, he sought assistance from the Greeks. Though refused aid by [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]], he succeeded in obtaining a thousand Theban heavy-armed hoplites under Lacrates, three thousand Argives under Nicostratus, and six thousand Æolians, [[Ionians]], and Dorians from the Greek cities of Asia Minor. This Greek support was numerically small, amounting to no more than 10,000 men, but it formed, together with the Greek mercenaries from Egypt who went over to him afterwards, the force on which he placed his chief reliance, and to which the ultimate success of his expedition was mainly due. The approach of Artaxerxes sufficiently weakened the resolution of Tennes that he endeavoured to purchase his own pardon by delivering up 100 principal citizens of Sidon into the hands of the Persian king, and then admitting Artaxerxes within the defences of the town. Artaxerxes had the 100 citizens transfixed with javelins, and when 500 more came out as supplicants to seek his mercy, Artaxerxes consigned them to the same fate. Sidon was then burnt to the ground, either by Artaxerxes or by the Sidonian citizens. Forty thousand people died in the conflagration.&lt;ref name=Persianempire/&gt; Artaxerxes sold the ruins at a high price to speculators, who calculated on reimbursing themselves by the treasures which they hoped to dig out from among the ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomrawlinson.com/Personal/Links/RawlinsonGeorge.htm |title=Phœnicia under the Persians |accessdate=March 10, 2008 |last=Rawlinson |first=George |authorlink=George Rawlinson |year=1889 |work=History of Phoenicia |publisher=Longmans, Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennes was later put to death by Artaxerxes.&lt;ref name=Lovetoknow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Artaxerxes |title=Artaxerxes |accessdate=March 4, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080312114204/http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Artaxerxes| archivedate=12 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaxerxes later sent Jews who supported the revolt to [[Hyrcania]] the south coast of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/GogAndMagog.htm |title=The Legend Of Gog And Magog |accessdate=March 10, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080315084037/http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/GogAndMagog.htm| archivedate=15 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary |last=Bruce |first=Frederick Fyvie |year=1990 |publisher=Wm.

===Second conquest of Egypt===
[[File:NectaneboII-StatueHead MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|Head of [[Nectanebo II]]]]
[[File:Darius II cartouche at Hibis d1.jpg|235px|thumb|left|Egyptian [[Cartouche]] of [[Darius I]] at the [[Temple of Hibis]]]]
The reduction of Sidon was followed closely by the invasion of Egypt. In 343&amp;nbsp;BC, Artaxerxes, in addition to his 330,000 Persians, had now a force of 14,000 Greeks furnished by the Greek cities of Asia Minor: 4,000 under [[Mentor of Rhodes|Mentor]], consisting of the troops which he had brought to the aid of Tennes from Egypt; 3,000 sent by Argos; and 1000 from Thebes. He divided these troops into three bodies, and placed at the head of each a Persian and a Greek. The Greek commanders were Lacrates of Thebes, [[Mentor of Rhodes]] and Nicostratus of Argos while the Persians were led by Rhossaces, Aristazanes, and [[Bagoas]], the chief of the eunuchs. [[Nectanebo II]] resisted with an army of 100,000 of whom 20,000 were Greek mercenaries. Nectanebo II occupied the [[Nile]] and its various branches with his large navy.

The character of the country, intersected by numerous canals and full of strongly fortified towns, was in his favour and Nectanebo II might have been expected to offer a prolonged, if not even a successful, resistance.  However, he lacked good generals, and, over-confident in his own powers of command, he was out-manoeuvred by the Greek mercenary generals and his forces eventually defeated by the combined Persian armies at the [[Battle of Pelusium (343 BC)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Persianempire&quot;/&gt; After his defeat, Nectanebo hastily fled to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], leaving the fortified towns to be defended by their garrisons. These garrisons consisted of partly [[Greeks|Greek]] and partly Egyptian troops; between whom jealousies and suspicions were easily sown by the Persian leaders. As a result, the Persians were able to rapidly reduce numerous towns across Lower Egypt and were advancing upon Memphis when Nectanebo decided to quit the country and flee southwards to [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Persianempire&quot;/&gt; The Persian army completely routed the Egyptians and occupied the Lower Delta of the Nile. Following Nectanebo fleeing to Ethiopia, all of Egypt submitted to Artaxerxes. The Jews in Egypt were sent either to [[Babylon]] or to the south coast of the [[Caspian Sea]], the same location that the Jews of [[Phoenicia]] had earlier been sent.

After this victory over the Egyptians, Artaxerxes had the city walls destroyed, started a reign of terror, and set about looting all the temples. [[Persia]] gained a significant amount of wealth from this looting. Artaxerxes also raised high taxes and attempted to weaken [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] enough that it could never revolt against Persia. For the 10&amp;nbsp;years that Persia controlled Egypt, believers in the native religion were persecuted and sacred books were stolen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egyptloot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/history/periods/persianii.html |title=Persian Period II |accessdate=March 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217023749/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/history/periods/persianii.html |archivedate=17 February 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he returned to Persia, he appointed Pherendares as [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|satrap of Egypt]]. With the wealth gained from his reconquering Egypt, Artaxerxes was able to amply reward his mercenaries.  He then returned to his capital having successfully completed his invasion of Egypt.

After his success in Egypt, Artaxerxes returned to Persia and spent the next few years effectively quelling insurrections in various parts of the Empire so that a few years after his conquest of Egypt, the Persian Empire was firmly under his control. Egypt remained a part of the Persian Empire until [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt.

[[File:Achaemenid Empire.gif|thumb|350px|Persian Empire timeline including important events and territorial evolution.]]

After the conquest of Egypt, there were no more revolts or rebellions against Artaxerxes. Mentor and [[Bagoas]], the two generals who had most distinguished themselves in the Egyptian campaign, were advanced to posts of the highest importance. Mentor, who was governor of the entire Asiatic seaboard, was successful in reducing to subjection many of the chiefs who during the recent troubles had rebelled against Persian rule. In the course of a few years Mentor and his forces were able to bring the whole Asian Mediterranean coast into complete submission and dependence.

Bagoas went back to the Persian capital with Artaxerxes, where he took a leading role in the internal administration of the Empire and maintained tranquility throughout the rest of the Empire. During the last six years of the reign of Artaxerxes III, the Persian Empire was governed by a vigorous and successful government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Persianempire&quot; /&gt;

The Persian forces in [[Ionia]] and [[Lycia]] regained control of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and took over much of [[Athens]]' former island empire. In response, [[Isocrates]] of Athens started giving speeches calling for a 'crusade against the barbarians' but there was not enough strength left in any of the Greek city-states to answer his call.&lt;ref name=&quot;conspiracy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html |title=Chapter V: Temporary Relief |accessdate=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there weren't any rebellions in the Persian Empire itself, the growing power and territory of [[Philip II of Macedon]] in [[Macedon]] (against which [[Demosthenes]] was in vain warning the Athenians) attracted the attention of Artaxerxes. In response, he ordered that Persian influence was to be used to check and constrain the rising power and influence of the Macedonian kingdom. In 340&amp;nbsp;BC, a Persian force was dispatched to assist the [[Thrace|Thracian prince]], [[Cersobleptes]], to maintain his independence. Sufficient effective aid was given to the city of [[Perinthus]] that the numerous and well-appointed army with which Philip had commenced his siege of the city was compelled to give up the attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Persianempire&quot;/&gt; By the last year of Artaxerxes' rule, Philip II already had plans in place for an invasion of the Persian Empire, which would crown his career, but the Greeks would not unite with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historyofmacedonia.org/AncientMacedonia/PhilipofMacedon.html |title= Philip of Macedon Philip II of Macedon Biography |accessdate=March 7, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080314165325/http://www.historyofmacedonia.org/AncientMacedonia/PhilipofMacedon.html| archivedate=14 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of the empire===

[[File:Alexander’s first victory over Darius, the Persian king.jpg|thumb|Alexander's first victory over Darius, the Persian king depicted in medieval European style in the 15th century romance ''The History of Alexander's Battles'']]
Artaxerxes III was succeeded by [[Artaxerxes IV Arses]], who before he could act was also poisoned by Bagoas. Bagoas is further said to have killed not only all Arses' children, but many of the other princes of the land. Bagoas then placed [[Darius III]], a nephew of Artaxerxes IV, on the throne. Darius III, previously [[Orontid Dynasty|Satrap of Armenia]], personally forced Bagoas to swallow poison. In 334 BC, when Darius was just succeeding in subduing Egypt again, Alexander and his battle-hardened troops [[Wars of Alexander the Great|invaded Asia Minor]].

[[Alexander the Great]] (Alexander III of Macedon) defeated the Persian armies at [[Battle of Granicus|Granicus]] (334 BC), followed by [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] (333 BC), and lastly at [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]] (331 BC). Afterwards, he marched on [[Susa]] and [[Persepolis]] which surrendered in early 330 BC. From Persepolis, Alexander headed north to Pasargadae where he visited the [[tomb of Cyrus]], the burial of the man whom he had heard of from the ''[[Cyropedia]]''.

In the ensuing chaos created by Alexander's invasion of Persia, Cyrus's tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When Alexander reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which it had been treated, and questioned the Magi, putting them on trial.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite book| authors = ((grk.)

Darius III was taken prisoner by [[Bessus]], his [[Bactria]]n [[satrap]] and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men murder Darius III and then declared himself Darius' successor, as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia leaving Darius' body in the road to delay Alexander, who brought it to Persepolis for an honorable funeral. Bessus would then create a coalition of his forces, in order to create an army to defend against Alexander. Before Bessus could fully unite with his confederates at the eastern part of the empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Theodore Ayrault Dodge| title = Alexander: a history of the origin and growth of the art of war from the earliest times to the battle of Ipsus, B.C. 301, with a detailed account of the campaigns of the great Macedonian| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0RcwAAAAYAAJ| year = 1890| publisher = Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.| page = 438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, fearing the danger of Bessus gaining control, found him, put him on trial in a Persian court under his control, and ordered his execution in a &quot;cruel and barbarous manner&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =  William Smith| title = A smaller history of Greece: from the earliest times to the Roman conquest| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vPQVAAAAYAAJ| year = 1887| publisher = Harper &amp; Brothers| page = 196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander generally kept the original Achaemenid administrative structure, leading some scholars to dub him as &quot;the last of the Achaemenids&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Pierre Briant |author2=Amélie Kuhrt|author3= Amélie Kuhrt| title = Alexander the Great and His Empire: A Short Introduction| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ziEp4kjhW9AC| date = 26 July 2010| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-14194-7| pages = 183–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Alexander's death in 323 BC, his empire was divided among his generals, the [[Diadochi]], resulting in a number of smaller states.  The largest of these, which held sway over the Iranian plateau, was [[Seleucid Empire]], ruled by Alexander's general [[Seleucus I Nicator]]. Native Iranian rule would be restored by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] of northeastern Iran over the course of the 2nd century BC.

===Descendants in later Iranian dynasties===
[[Istakhr]], one of the vassal kingdoms of the [[Parthian Empire]], would be overthrown by Papak, a priest of the temple there. Papak's son, Ardašir I, who named himself in remembrance of Artaxerxes II, would revolt against the Parthians, eventually defeating them and establishing the [[Sassanid Empire]] or as it is known the second Persian Empire.

The Achaemenid line would be carried on through the [[Kingdom of Pontus]], based in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region of northern [[Asia Minor]]. This Pontic Kingdom, a state of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;The Foreign Policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus, by B. C. McGing, page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Children of Achilles: The Greeks in Asia Minor Since the Days of Troy, by John Freely, page 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strabo of Amasia: A Greek Man of Letters in Augustan Rome, by Daniela Dueck, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iranicaonline.org&quot;&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/pontus&lt;/ref&gt; may even have been directly related to [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] and the [[Achaemenid dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iranicaonline.org&quot;/&gt; It was founded by [[Mithridates I of Pontus|Mithridates I]] in 281 BC and lasted until its conquest by the [[Roman Republic]] in 63 BC. The kingdom grew to its largest extent under [[Mithridates VI]] the Great, who conquered [[Colchis]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Bithynia]], the Greek colonies of the [[Chersonesus Taurica|Tauric Chersonesos]] and for a brief time the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. Thus, this Persian dynasty managed to survive and prosper in the [[Hellenistic world]] while the main Persian Empire had fallen.

Both the later dynasties of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] would on occasion claim Achaemenid descent. Recently there has been some corroboration for the Parthian claim to Achaemenid ancestry via the possibility of an inherited disease (neurofibromatosis) demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of familial disease on ancient coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ashrafian, Hutan.|title=Limb gigantism, neurofibromatosis and royal heredity in the Ancient World 2500 years ago: Achaemenids and Parthians|journal=J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg|volume=64|year=2011|page=557|doi= 10.1016/j.bjps.2010.08.025|url= http://www.jprasurg.com/article/S1748-6815(10)00521-8/pdf%7C.|issue=4|pmid=20832372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of decline===
Part of the cause of the Empire's decline had been the heavy tax burden put upon the state, which eventually led to economic decline.&lt;ref&gt;A.T. Olmstead, ''History of the Persian Empire'', &quot;Overtaxation and Its Results,' University of Chicago Press, ç1948, p.&amp;nbsp;289–301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Ancient Civilizations'', ed. Arthur Cotterell, Penguin Books Ltd., London, ç1980, p.154&lt;/ref&gt; An estimate of the tribute imposed on the subject nations was up to U.S. $180M per year. This does not include the material goods and supplies that were supplied as taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will Durant p.363&quot;&gt;Will Durant, ''Our Oriental Heritage,'' Simon and Schuster, Inc., New York, ç1935, p.363&lt;/ref&gt; After the high overhead of government - the military, the bureaucracy, whatever the satraps could safely dip into the coffers for themselves - this money went into the royal treasury. According to Diodorus, at Persepolis, Alexander III found some 180,000 [[Attic talent]]s of silver besides the additional treasure the Macedonians were carrying that already had been seized in Damascus by [[Parmenion]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Robinson Jr., ''Ancient History'', 2nd ed., MacMillan Company, New York, ç1967, p.328, 338&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=citation is a rarely accepted &quot;fact&quot; that is based on a most unreliable account (Diodorus) who moreover himself lived two centuries later|date=October 2015}} This amounted to U.S. $2.7B.

Another factor contributing to the decline of the Empire after Xerxes was its failure to ever mold the many subject nations into a whole; the creation of a national identity was never attempted.&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant, ''Our Oriental Heritage,'' Simon and Schuster, Inc., New York, ç1935, p.382&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of cohesion eventually affected the efficiency of the military.&lt;ref&gt;R.L.

[[Cyrus the Great]] founded the empire as a multi-[[State (polity)|state]] empire, governed by four capital states; [[Pasargadae]], [[Babylon]], [[Susa]] and [[Ekbatana]]. The Achaemenids allowed a certain amount of regional autonomy in the form of the [[satrap]]y system. A satrapy was an administrative unit, usually organized on a geographical basis. A '[[satrap]]' (governor) was the governor who administered the region, a 'general' supervised military recruitment and ensured order, and a 'state secretary' kept the official records. The general and the state secretary reported directly to the satrap as well as the central government. At differing times, there were between 20 and 30 satrapies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSm68TxRBRo ''Engineering an Empire – The Persians'']. Broadcast of ''[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'', narrated by [[Peter Weller]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyrus the Great created an organized army including the [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]] unit, consisting of 10,000 highly trained soldiers&lt;ref name=army&gt;{{cite book| author = Pierre Briant| title = From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire| url = https://books.google.com/?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC| year = 2006| publisher = Eisenbrauns| isbn = 978-1-57506-120-7| page = 261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus also formed an innovative [[postal system]] throughout the empire, based on several relay stations called [[Chapar Khaneh]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Herodotus, trans. A.D. Godley, vol. 4, book 8, verse 98, pp. 96–97 (1924).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darius the Great]] reinforced the empire and expanded [[Persepolis]] as a ceremonial capital;&lt;ref&gt;''Persepolis Recreated'', NEJ International Pictures; 1st edition (2005) ISBN 978-964-06-4525-3 {{ASIN|B000J5N46S}}, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCwxJsk14e4&lt;/ref&gt; he revolutionized the economy by placing it on a silver and gold coinage and introducing a regulated and sustainable tax system that was precisely tailored to each satrapy, based on their supposed productivity and their economic potential. For instance, [[Babylon]] was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities – 1000 [[Talent (measurement)|silver talents]], four months supply of food for the army. [[Hindush|India]] was clearly already fabled for its gold; [[Egypt]] was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire (as later of Rome's) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver. This was exclusively a tax levied on subject peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyworld.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa65 |title=History Of Iran (Persia) |publisher=Historyworld.net |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accomplishments of Darius' reign included [[codification (law)|codification]] of the data, a universal legal system, and construction of a new capital at Persepolis.

Under the Achaemenids, the trade was extensive and there was an efficient infrastructure that facilitated the exchange of commodities in the far reaches of the empire. Tariffs on trade were one of the empire's main sources of revenue, along with agriculture and tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyworld.net&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/D/DAR/darius-i-the-great.html |title=Darius I (Darius the Great), King of Persia (from 521 BC) |publisher=1902encyclopedia.com |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satrapies were linked by a 2,500-kilometer highway, the most impressive stretch being the [[Royal Road]] from [[Susa]] to [[Sardis]], built by command of Darius I. The relays of mounted couriers could reach the remotest of areas in fifteen days. Herodotus observes that &quot;there is nothing in the world that travels faster than these Persian couriers. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these courageous couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.&quot;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Despite the relative local independence afforded by the satrapy system, royal inspectors, the &quot;eyes and ears of the king&quot;, toured the empire and reported on local conditions.

The practice of slavery in Achaemenid Persia was generally banned, although there is evidence that conquered and/or rebellious armies were sold into captivity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Dandamayev, &quot;Foreign Slaves on the Estates of the Achaemenid Kings and their Nobles,&quot; in Trudy dvadtsat' pyatogo mezhdunarodnogo kongressa vostokovedov II, Moscow, 1963, pp. 151–52&lt;/ref&gt; The kings of Achaemenid Persia, especially the founder [[Cyrus the Great]], occasionally declined to adopt slavery, as evidenced by the freeing of the Jews at Babylon, and the construction of Persepolis by paid workers.

Despite its humble origins in Persis, the empire reached an enormous size under the leadership of [[Cyrus the Great]]. Cyrus created a multi-state empire where he allowed regional rulers, called the '[[satrap]]' to rule as his proxy over a certain designated area of his empire called the [[satrapy]]. The basic rule of governance was based upon loyalty and obedience of each satrapy to the central power, or the king, and compliance with tax laws.&lt;ref name=cyv/&gt; Due to the ethnocultural diversity of the subject nations under the rule of Persia, its enormous geographic size, and the constant struggle for power by regional competitors,&lt;ref name=book/&gt; the creation of a professional army was necessary for both maintenance of the peace, and also to enforce the authority of the king in cases of rebellion and foreign threat.&lt;ref name=schmitt-EI-i/&gt;&lt;ref name=army/&gt; Cyrus managed to create a strong land army, using it to advance in his campaigns in [[Babylonian empire|Babylonia]], Lydia, and [[Asia Minor]], which after his death was used by his son [[Cambyses II]], in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] against [[Psamtik III]]. Cyrus would die battling a local Iranian insurgency in the empire, before he could have a chance to develop a naval force.&lt;ref&gt;A history of Greece, Volume 2, By Connop Thirlwall, Longmans, 1836, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; That task however would fall to [[Darius the Great]], who would officially give Persians their own royal navy to allow them to engage their enemies on multiple seas of this vast empire, from the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]], to the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Ionian Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

===Infantry===
The Achaemenid infantry consisted of three groups: the [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|Immortals]], the [[Sparabara]], and the [[Takabara]], though in the later years of the Achaemenid Empire, the [[Cardaces]], were introduced.

The [[Immortals (Persian empire)|Immortals]] were described by [[Herodotus]] as being heavy [[infantry]], led by [[Hydarnes II|Hydarnes]], that were kept constantly at a strength of exactly 10,000 men. He claimed that the unit's name stemmed from the custom that every killed, seriously wounded, or sick member was immediately replaced with a new one, maintaining the numbers and cohesion of the unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Persian Immortals |url=http://www.livius.org/ia-in/immortals/immortals.html|author=Jona Lendering|date= |work=Ancient Persia |publisher= |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had wicker shields, short spears, swords or large daggers, bow and arrow. Underneath their robes they wore [[scale armour]] coats. The spear counterbalances of the common soldiery were of silver; to differentiate commanding ranks, the officers' spear butt-spikes were golden.&lt;ref name=&quot;livius.org2&quot;&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ia-in/immortals/immortals.html]. Retrieved 16 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving Achaemenid coloured glazed bricks and carved reliefs represent the Immortals as wearing elaborate robes, hoop earrings and gold jewelry, though these garments and accessories were most likely worn only for ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Volume IX, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Fifteenth Edition 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sparabara]] unit were usually the first to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Although not much is known about them today, it is believed that they were the backbone of the Persian army who formed a [[shield wall]] and used their two-metre-long spears to protect more vulnerable troops such as [[Archery|archers]] from the enemy. The Sparabara were taken from the full members of Persian society, they were trained from childhood to be soldiers and when not called out to fight on campaigns in distant lands they practised hunting on the vast plains of [[Persia]]. However, when all was quiet and the [[Pax Persica]] held true, the ''Sparabara'' returned to normal life farming the land and grazing their herds. Because of this they lacked true professional quality on the battlefield, yet they were well trained and courageous to the point of holding the line in most situations long enough for a counterattack. They were armoured with quilted [[linen]] and carried large rectangular [[wicker]] shields as a form of light manoeuvrable defense. This, however, left them at a severe disadvantage against heavily armoured opponents such as the [[hoplite]], and his two-metre-long spear was not able to give the Sparabara ample range to plausibly engage a trained [[phalanx formation|phalanx]]. The wicker shields were able to effectively stop arrows but not strong enough to protect the soldier from spears. However, the Sparabara could deal with most other infantry, including trained units from the East. The [[Takabara]] were a rare unit who were a tough type of [[peltasts]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Sekunda, ''The Persian Army 560–330 BC'', page 30, 1992, Osprey Publishing. ISBN 978-1-85532-250-9&lt;/ref&gt; Takabara nevertheless were more garrison warriors than front line fighters as proved against the well-armed [[Hoplites]] of Greece where they were easily defeated in hand to hand conflict.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} They tended to fight with their own native weapons which would have included a crescent-shaped light wickerwork [[shield]] and [[axe]]s as well as light linen cloth and [[leather]]. The Takabara were recruited from territories that incorporated modern Iraq and parts of Iran.

===Cavalry===

{{cquote|The armoured Persian horsemen and their death dealing chariots were invincible.
No man dared face them|||[[Herodotus]]}}

The Persian Cavalry was crucial for conquering nations, and had maintained its importance in the Achaemenid army to the last days of the Achaemenid Empire. The cavalry were separated into four groups. The Chariot Archers, [[Horse cavalry]], the [[Camel cavalry]], and the [[Persian war elephants|Elephant Cavalry]].

In the later years of the Achaemenid Empire, the Chariot archer had become merely a ceremonial part of the Persian army, yet in the early years of the Empire, their use was widespread. The Chariot archers were armed with Spears, Bows, Arrows, Swords, and [[scale armour]]. The horses were also suited with [[scale armour]] similar to scale armour of the [[Sassanian]] [[Cataphract]]s. The Chariots would contain imperial symbols and Decorations. The [[Horse]]s used by the Achaemenids for Cavalry were often suited with [[scale armour]], like most cavalry units. The riders often had the same armour as Infantry units, wicker shields, short spears, swords or large daggers, bow and arrow and [[scale armour]] coats. The [[Camel cavalry]] was different, because the Camels and sometimes the riders, were provided little protection against enemies, yet when they were offered protection, they would have Spears, Swords, Bow, Arrow, and [[scale armour]]. The Persian Camel Cavalry was first introduced into the Persian army by [[Cyrus the Great]], at the [[battle of Thymbra]]. The [[Persian war elephant]] was most likely introduced into the Persian army by [[Darius I]] after his [[Achaemenid invasion of the Indus Valley|conquest of the Indus Valley]]. They may have been used in Greek campaigns by Darius and [[Xerxes I]], but Greek accounts only mention 15 of them being used at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]].

===Navy===
Since its foundation by Cyrus, the Persian empire had been primarily a land empire with a strong army, but void of any actual naval forces. By the 5th century BC, this was to change, as the empire came across Greek, and Egyptian forces, each with their own maritime traditions and capabilities. [[Darius the Great]] (Darius I) is to be credited as the first Achaemenid king to invest in a Persian fleet.&lt;ref name=navy&gt;{{cite book| author = Kaveh Farrokh| title = Shadows in the desert: ancient Persia at war| url = https://books.google.com/?id=p7kltwf9yrwC| year = 2007| publisher = Osprey Publishing| isbn = 978-1-84603-108-3| page = 68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even by then no true &quot;imperial navy&quot; had existed either in Greece or Egypt. Persia would become the first empire, under Darius, to inaugurate and deploy the first regular imperial navy.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; Despite this achievement, the personnel for the imperial navy would not come from Iran, but were often [[Phoenicia]]ns (mostly from [[Sidon]]), [[Egyptians]] and [[Greek people|Greeks]] chosen by Darius the Great to operate the empire's combat vessels.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;

At first the ships were built in Sidon by the Phoenicians; the first Achaemenid ships measured about 40 meters in length and 6 meters in width, able to transport up to 300 Persian [[Persian Immortals|troops]] at any one trip. Soon, other states of the empire were constructing their own ships, each incorporating slight local preferences. The ships eventually found their way to the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; Persian naval forces laid the foundation for a strong Persian maritime presence in the Persian Gulf. Persians were not only stationed on islands in the Persian Gulf, but also had ships often of 100 to 200 capacity patrolling the empire's various rivers including the Caroon or Karun ( Arabic name:[[Shatt-al-Arab]]), [[Tigris river|Tigris]] and [[Nile]] in the west, as well as the [[Indus River|Indus]].&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;

The Achaemenid navy established bases located along the Shatt-al-Arab, Bahrain, Oman, and Yemen. The Persian fleet was not only used for peace-keeping purposes along the Shatt al-Arab but also opened the door to trade with India via the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; Darius's navy was in many ways a world power at the time, but it would be [[Artaxerxes II]] who in the summer of 397 BC would build a formidable navy, as part of a rearmament which would lead to his decisive victory at [[Knidos]] in 394 BC, reestablishing Achaemenid power in [[Ionia]]. Artaxerxes II would also utilize his navy to later on quell a rebellion in Egypt.&lt;ref name=navi&gt;{{cite book| author = Elspeth R. M. Dusinberre| title = Aspects of empire in Achaemenid Sardis| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uWkzTBHB6ekC| year = 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-81071-5| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction material of choice was wood, but some armored Achaemenid ships had metallic blades on the front, often meant to slice enemy ships using the ship's momentum. Naval ships were also equipped with hooks on the side to grab enemy ships, or to negotiate their position. The ships were propelled by sails or manpower. The ships the Persians created were unique. As far as maritime engagement, the ships were equipped with two [[mangonel]]s that would launch projectiles such as stones, or flammable substances.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;

[[Xenophon]] describes his eye-witness account of a massive military bridge created by joining 37 Persian ships across the Tigris river. The Persians utilized each boat's buoyancy, in order to support a connected bridge above which supply could be transferred.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; [[Herodotus]] also gives many accounts of Persians utilizing ships to build bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], Volume 4, Issues 5–8|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year=1982|author=Ehsan Yar-Shater|authorlink=Ehsan Yarshater}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Persian Empire|author=John Manuel Cook|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1983|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=Achaemenid+boat+bridge&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;q=Achaemenid+boat+bridge+Bosphorus&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=f0ddf7f432501006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Darius the Great, in an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horsemen north of the Black Sea, crossed over at the [[Bosphorus]], using an enormous bridge made by connecting Achaemenid boats, then marched up to the [[Danube]], crossing it by means of a second boat bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. V. Cernenko |author2=Angus McBride |author3=M. V. Gorelik | title = The Scythians, 700-300 BC| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ozA8d9AFiMgC| date = 1983-03-24| publisher = Osprey Publishing| isbn = 978-0-85045-478-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge over the Bosphorus essentially connected the nearest tip of Asia to Europe, encompassing at least some 1000 meters of open water if not more. Herodotus describes the spectacle, and calls it the &quot;bridge of Darius&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors = Herodotus (Translation by George Rawlinson, Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, Sir John Gardner Wilkinson); George Rawlinson; Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson; Sir John Gardner Wilkinson | title = The History of Herodotus: a new English version, Volume 3| url = https://books.google.com/?id=UYkOAAAAQAAJ| year = 1859| publisher = John Murray| pages = 77 (Chp. 86) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;''Strait called Bosphorus, across which the bridge of Darius had been thrown is hundred and twenty [[furlong]]s in length, reaching from the [[Euxine]], to the [[Propontis]]. The Propontis is five hundred furlongs across, and fourteen hundred long. Its waters flow into the [[Dardanelles|Hellespont]], the length of which is four hundred furlongs&amp;nbsp;...''&quot;

Years later, a similar boat bridge would be constructed by Xerxes the Great ([[Xerxes I]]), in his invasion of Greece. Although the Persians failed to capture the Greek city states completely, the tradition of maritime involvement was carried down by the Persian kings, most notably Artaxerxes II. Years later, when Alexander invaded Persia and during his advancement into India, he took a page from the Persian art of war, by having [[Hephaestion]] and [[Perdiccas]] construct a similar boat-bridge at the Indus river, in India in spring of 327 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Waldemar Heckel| title = Who's who in the age of Alexander the Great: prosopography of Alexander's empire| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JJ4K1wFZkrsC| year = 2006| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| isbn = 978-1-4051-1210-9| page = 134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]], in his mid-5th century BC account of Persian residents of the Pontus, reports that Persian youths, from their fifth year to their twentieth year, were instructed in three things – ''to ride a horse, to draw a bow, and to speak the Truth''.&lt;ref name=hero&gt;{{cite book| author = Herodotus |others=Translated by George Rawlinson| title = The Histories| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YTCrx1KB3HQC| date = 2009|origyear=publication date| publisher = Digireads.Com| isbn = 978-1-4209-3305-5| pages = 43–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further notes that:&lt;ref name=hero/&gt;
:the most disgraceful thing in the world [the Persians] think, is to tell a lie; the next worst, to owe a debt: because, among other reasons, the debtor is obliged to tell lies.

In Achaemenid Persia, the lie, ''druj'', is considered to be a [[Seven deadly sins|cardinal sin]], and it was punishable by death in some extreme cases.

It was Darius the Great who laid down the ''ordinance of good regulations'' during his reign. King Darius' testimony about his constant battle against the lie is found in [[cuneiform]] inscriptions. Carved high up in the [[Behistun Inscription|Behistun]] mountain on the road to [[Kermanshah]], [[Darius the Great]] (Darius I) testifies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Brian Carr|author2=Brian Carr|author3=Indira Mahalingam| title = Companino Encyclopedia of Asian philosophy| url = https://books.google.com/?id=osxPipnXeN0C| year = 1997| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| isbn = 978-0-415-03535-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:I was not a lie-follower, I was not a doer of wrong&amp;nbsp;... According to righteousness I conducted myself. Neither to the weak or to the powerful did I do wrong. The man who cooperated with my house, him I rewarded well; who so did injury, him I punished well.

Darius had his hands full dealing with large-scale rebellion which broke out throughout the empire. After fighting successfully with nine traitors in a year, Darius records his battles against them for posterity and tells us how it was the ''lie'' that made them rebel against the empire. At Behistun, Darius says:

:I smote them and took prisoner nine kings. One was Gaumata by name, a Magian; he lied; thus he said: I am Smerdis, the son of Cyrus&amp;nbsp;... One, Acina by name, an Elamite; he lied; thus he said: I am king in Elam&amp;nbsp;... One, Nidintu-Bel by name, a Babylonian; he lied; thus he said: I am Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabonidus.

King Darius then tells us,
:The Lie made them rebellious, so that these men deceived the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darius, Behishtan (DB), Column 1|url=http://www.avesta.org/op/op.htm#db1}} From {{cite book|last=Kent|first=Roland G.|year=1953|title=Old Persian: Grammar, texts, lexicon|location=New Haven|publisher=American Oriental Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then advice to his son [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], who is to succeed him as the great king:
:Thou who shalt be king hereafter, protect yourself vigorously from the Lie; the man who shall be a lie-follower, him do thou punish well, if thus thou shall think. May my country be secure!

===Languages===

During the reign of Cyrus and Darius, and as long as the seat of government was still at [[Susa]] in [[Elam]], the language of the chancellory was [[Elamite language|Elamite]]. This is primarily attested in the [[Persepolis Fortification Tablets|Persepolis fortification and treasury tablets]] that reveal details of the day-to-day functioning of the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIR_Dandamayev_Elamite&quot;/&gt; In the grand rock-face inscriptions of the kings, the Elamite texts are always accompanied by [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (Babylonian dialect) and [[Old Persian]] inscriptions, and it appears that in these cases, the Elamite texts are translations of the Old Persian ones. It is then likely that although Elamite was used by the capital government in Susa, it was not a standardized language of government everywhere in the empire. The use of Elamite is not attested after 458 BC.

Following the conquest of Mesopotamia, the [[Official Aramaic|Aramaic]] language (as used in that territory) was adopted as a &quot;vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed &quot;Official Aramaic&quot; or &quot;Imperial Aramaic&quot;, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|title=Aramaic&lt;!-- pp:250-261 --&gt;&lt;!-- section:Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire pp:251/252--&gt;|last=Shaked|first=Saul|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=250–261}} p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Richard Frye questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an &quot;[[official language]]&quot;, noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frye|first=Richard N.|title=Review of G. R. Driver's &quot;Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B.

R.}} p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought. Many centuries after the fall of the empire, [[Aramaic script]] and – as [[huzvarishn|ideograms]] – Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi writing system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Wilhelm Geiger|Geiger, Wilhelm]] |author2=[[Ernst Kuhn]]|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I.

Although Old Persian also appears on some seals and art objects, that language is attested primarily in the Achaemenid inscriptions of Western Iran, suggesting then that Old Persian was the common language of that region. However, by the reign of Artaxerxes II, the grammar and orthography of the inscriptions was so &quot;far from perfect&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ware, James R.  |author2=Kent, Roland G.|title=The Old Persian Cuneiform Inscriptions of Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=55|year=1924|pages=52–61|doi=10.2307/283007|jstor=283007|publisher=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 55}} p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; that it has been suggested that the scribes who composed those texts had already largely forgotten the language, and had to rely on older inscriptions, which they to a great extent reproduced verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gershevitch|first=Ilya|title=Zoroaster's own contribution|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=23|issue=1|year=1964|pages=12–38|doi=10.1086/371754}} p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the occasion demanded, Achaemenid administrative correspondence was conducted in [[Old Greek|Greek]], making it a widely used [[bureaucratic]] language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranian, E. Tucker 2001&quot;/&gt; Even though the Achaemenids had extensive contacts with the Greeks and vice versa, and had conquered many of the Greek-speaking areas both in [[Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]] during different periods of the empire, the native Old Iranian sources provide no indication of Greek linguistic evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranian, E. Tucker 2001&quot;/&gt; However, there is plenty of evidence (in addition to the accounts of Herodotus) that Greeks, apart from being deployed and employed in the core regions of the empire, also evidently lived and worked in the heartland of the Achaemenid Empire, namely Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranian, E. Tucker 2001&quot;/&gt; For example, Greeks were part of the various ethnicities that constructed Darius' palace in [[Susa]], apart from the Greek inscriptions found nearby there, and one short Persepolis tablet written in Greek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranian, E. Tucker 2001&quot;/&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentions that the Persians were invited to great birthday feasts (Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 8), which would be followed by many desserts, a treat which they reproached the Greeks for omitting from their meals. He also observed that the Persians drank wine in large quantities and used it even for counsel, deliberating on important affairs when drunk, and deciding the next day, when sober, whether to act on the decision or set it aside. Bowing to superiors, or royalty was one of the many Persian customs adopted by [[Alexander the Great]].

===Religion===

It was during the Achaemenid period that [[Zoroastrianism]] reached South-Western Iran, where it came to be accepted by the rulers and through them became a defining element of Persian culture. The religion was not only accompanied by a formalization of the concepts and divinities of the traditional Iranian [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] but also introduced several novel ideas, including that of [[Free will in theology|free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = A. V. Williams Jackson| title = Zoroastrian Studies: The Iranian Religion and Various Monographs (1928)| url = https://books.google.com/?id=GFa3HZZc87AC| year = 2003| publisher = Kessinger Publishing| isbn = 978-0-7661-6655-4| page = 224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Virginia Schomp| title = The Ancient Persians| url = https://books.google.com/?id=U21j7vDhCCIC| year = 2009| publisher = Marshall Cavendish| isbn = 978-0-7614-4218-9| page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the patronage of the Achaemenid kings, and by the 5th century BC as the ''de facto'' religion of the state, Zoroastrianism reached all corners of the empire. The Bible claims that [[Cyrus the Great]] allowed the Jews to return to their [[homeland]] after decades of captivity by the [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylon]]ian empires.

During the reign of Artaxerxes I and Darius II, Herodotus wrote &quot;[the Perses] have no images of the gods, no temples nor altars, and consider the use of them a sign of folly. This comes, I think, from their not believing the gods to have the same nature with men, as the Greeks imagine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herodotus, I.131&quot;&gt;Herodotus, I.131&lt;/ref&gt; He claims the Persians offer sacrifice to: &quot;the sun and moon, to the earth, to fire, to water, and to the winds. These are the only gods whose worship has come down to them from ancient times. At a later period they began the worship of [[Urania]], which they borrowed from the Arabians and Assyrians. [[Mylitta]] is the name by which the Assyrians know this [[goddess]], to whom the Persians referred as [[Anahita]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herodotus, I.131&quot;/&gt; (The original name here is [[Mithra]], which has since been explained to be a confusion of Anahita with Mithra, understandable since they were commonly worshipped together in one temple).

From the Babylonian scholar-priest [[Berossus|Berosus]], who—although writing over seventy years after the reign of [[Artaxerxes II|Artaxerxes II Mnemon]]—records that the emperor had been the first to make [[cult]] statues of divinities and have them placed in temples in many of the major cities of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Berosus, III.65&lt;/ref&gt; Berosus also substantiates Herodotus when he says the Persians knew of no images of gods until Artaxerxes II erected those images. On the means of sacrifice, Herodotus adds &quot;they raise no altar, light no fire, pour no libations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herodotus, I.132&quot;&gt;Herodotus, I.132&lt;/ref&gt; This sentence has been interpreted to identify a critical (but later) accretion to Zoroastrianism. An altar with a wood-burning fire and the [[Yasna]] service at which libations are poured are all clearly identifiable with modern Zoroastrianism, but apparently, were practices that had not yet developed in the mid-5th century. Boyce also assigns that development to the reign of Artaxerxes II (4th century BC), as an orthodox response to the innovation of the shrine cults.

Herodotus also observed that &quot;no prayer or offering can be made without a [[Magi|magus]] present&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herodotus, I.132&quot;/&gt; but this should not be confused with what is today understood by the term ''magus'', that is a ''magupat'' (modern Persian: ''mobed''), a Zoroastrian priest. Nor does Herodotus' description of the term as one of the tribes or castes of the Medes necessarily imply that these ''magi'' were Medians. They simply were a hereditary priesthood to be found all over Western Iran and although (originally) not associated with any one specific religion, they were traditionally responsible for all ritual and religious services. Although the unequivocal identification of the ''magus'' with Zoroastrianism came later (Sassanid era, 3rd–7th century AD), it is from Herodotus' ''magus'' of the mid-5th century that Zoroastrianism was subject to doctrinal modifications that are today considered to be revocations of the original teachings of the prophet. Also, many of the ritual practices described in the [[Avesta|Avesta's]] ''Vendidad'' (such as [[exposure of the dead (Zoroastrianism)|exposure of the dead]]) were already practiced by the ''magu'' of Herodotus' time.

===Art and architecture===
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
{{Main article|Achaemenid architecture}}
[[File:Sphinx Darius Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Winged [[sphinx]] from the palace of [[Darius the Great]] at Susa, [[Louvre]].]]
[[File:Lion Darius Palace Louvre Sb3298.jpg|thumb|Lion on a decorative panel from [[Darius I the Great]]'s palace, Louvre]]
''Achaemenid architecture'' includes large cities, temples, palaces, and [[mausoleums]] such as the [[tomb of Cyrus]] the Great. The quintessential feature of Persian architecture was its eclectic nature with elements of Median, Assyrian, and Asiatic Greek all incorporated, yet maintaining a unique Persian identity seen in the finished products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Charles Henry Caffin| title = How to study architecture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=HnoWAAAAYAAJ| year = 1917| publisher = Dodd, Mead and Company| page = 80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Achaemenid art'' includes [[frieze]] reliefs, Metalwork such as the [[Oxus Treasure]], decoration of palaces, glazed brick masonry, fine craftsmanship (masonry, carpentry, etc.), and gardening. Although the Persians took artists, with their styles and techniques, from all corners of their empire, they produced not simply a combination of styles, but a synthesis of a new unique Persian style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Lipiński |author2=Karel van Lerberghe |author3=Antoon Schoors|author4=Karel Van Lerberghe|author5=Antoon Schoors| title = Immigration and emigration within the ancient Near East| url = https://books.google.com/?id=thIxCmwfNoMC| year = 1995| publisher = Peeters Publishers| isbn = 978-90-6831-727-5| page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus the Great in fact had an extensive ancient Iranian heritage behind him; the rich Achaemenid gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a specialty of the Medes, was for instance in the tradition of the delicate metalwork found in [[Iron Age]] II times at [[Hasanlu]] and still earlier at [[Marlik]].

One of the most remarkable examples of both Achaemenid architecture and art is the grand palace of [[Persepolis]], and its detailed workmanship, coupled with its grand scale. In describing the construction of his palace at [[Susa]], Darius the Great records that:
{{quote|Yaka timber was brought from [[Gandhara|Gandara]] and from [[Carmania (satrapy)|Carmania]]. The gold was brought from [[Sardis]] and from [[Bactria]]&amp;nbsp;... the precious stone lapis-lazuli and carnelian&amp;nbsp;... was brought from [[Sogdiana]]. The turquoise from [[Chorasmia]], the silver and ebony from [[Egypt]], the ornamentation from [[Ionia]], the ivory from [[Ethiopia]] and from [[Sindh]] and from [[Arachosia]]. The stone-cutters who wrought the stone, those were Ionians and [[Sardis|Sardians]]. The goldsmiths were [[Medes]] and [[Egyptians]]. The men who wrought the wood, those were Sardians and Egyptians. The men who wrought the baked brick, those were Babylonians. The men who adorned the wall, those were Medes and Egyptians.}}

This was imperial art on a scale the world had not seen before. Materials and artists were drawn from all corners of the empire, and thus tastes, styles, and motifs became mixed together in an eclectic art and architecture that in itself mirrored the Persian empire.
[[File:Artaxerses III tomb.jpg|thumb|300px|Tomb of Artaxerxes II in [[Persepolis]]]]

===Tombs===
Many Achaemenid rulers built tombs for themselves. The most famous, [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], is an ancient necropolis located about 12&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Persepolis]], with the tombs of four of the kings of the dynasty carved in this mountain: [[Tomb of Darius I|Darius I]], [[Xerxes I]], [[Artaxerxes I]] and [[Darius II]]. Other kings constructed their own tombs elsewhere.  [[Artaxerxes II]] and [[Artaxerxes III]] preferred to carve their tombs beside their summer capital [[Persepolis]], the left tomb belonging to [[Artaxerxes II]] and the right tomb belonging to [[Artaxerxes III]], the last Achaemenid king to have a tomb. The tomb of the founder of the Achaemenid dynasty, [[Cyrus the Great]], was built in [[Pasargadae]] (now a world heritage site).

==Legacy==
The Achaemenid Empire left a lasting impression on the heritage and the cultural identity of Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, as well as influencing the development and structure of future empires. In fact the Greeks and later on the Romans copied the best features of the Persian method of governing the empire, and vicariously adopted them.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mastering World History&quot; by Philip L. Groisser, New York, 1970, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georg W. F. Hegel]] in his work ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History|The Philosophy of History]]'' introduces the Persian Empire as the &quot;first empire that passed away&quot; and its people as the &quot;first historical people&quot; in history. According to his account;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of History|author=George W. F. Hegel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GbxWvCCUdD8C&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Georg+W.+F.+Hegel%22|isbn=978-1-60206-438-6|date=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Persian Empire is an empire in the modern sense – like that which existed in Germany, and the great imperial realm under the sway of Napoleon; for we find it consisting of a number of states, which are indeed dependant, but which have retained their own individuality, their manners, and laws. The general enactments, binding upon all, did not infringe upon their political and social idiosyncrasies, but even protected and maintained them; so that each of the nations that constitute the whole, had its own form of constitution. As light illuminates everything – imparting to each object a peculiar vitality – so the Persian Empire extends over a multitude of nations, and leaves to each one its particular character. Some have even kings of their own; each one its distinct language, arms, way of life and customs. All this diversity coexists harmoniously under the impartial dominion of Light&amp;nbsp;... a combination of peoples – leaving each of them free. Thereby, a stop is put to that [[Barbarian|barbarism]] and ferocity with which the nations had been wont to carry on their destructive feuds.

The famous American orientalist, Professor [[Arthur Upham Pope]] (1881–1969) said:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The History of the Persian Civilization&quot; by Arthur Pope, P.11&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The western world has a vast unpaid debt to the Persian Civilization!&quot;

[[Will Durant]], the American historian and philosopher, during one his speeches, &quot;Persia in the History of Civilization&quot;, as an address before the ''[[Iran–America Society]]'' in [[Tehran]] on 21 April 1948, stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Durant|first=Will|title=Persia in the History of Civilization|url=http://www.mazdapublisher.com/Documents/Persian%20Civilization.pdf|work=Addressing 'Iran-America Society|publisher=Mazda Publishers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:For thousands of years Persians have been creating beauty. Sixteen centuries before Christ there went from these regions or near it&amp;nbsp;... You have been here a kind of watershed of civilization, pouring your blood and thought and art and religion eastward and westward into the world&amp;nbsp;... I need not rehearse for you again the achievements of your Achaemenid period. Then for the first time in known history an empire almost as extensive as the United States received an orderly government, a competence of administration, a web of swift communications, a security of movement by men and goods on majestic roads, equaled before our time only by the zenith of Imperial Rome.
