A novel strain of '''[[Escherichia coli O104:H4|''Escherichia coli'' O104:H4]] bacteria''' caused a serious outbreak of [[foodborne illness]] focused in northern Germany in May through June 2011.  The illness was characterized by bloody diarrhea, with a high frequency of serious complications, including [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS), a condition that requires urgent treatment.  The outbreak was originally thought to have been caused by an [[enterohemorrhagic|enterohemorrhagic (EHEC)]] strain of ''E. coli'', but it was later shown to have been caused by an [[Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli|enteroaggregative ''E. coli'' (EAEC)]] strain that had acquired the genes to produce [[Shiga toxin]]s, present in [[organic food|organic]] fenugreek sprouts.

Epidemiological fieldwork suggested fresh vegetables were the source of infection.  The agriculture minister of [[Niedersachsen|Lower Saxony]] identified an [[organic farm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaertnerhof.org/ |title=Gärtnerhof Bienenbüttel |accessdate=13 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110612212804/http://www.gaertnerhof.org/| archivedate= 12 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bienenbüttel]], Lower Saxony, Germany, which produces a variety of [[Sprouting|sprouted foods]], as the likely source of the ''E. coli'' outbreak.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN0605&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/06/05/europe.e.coli/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 |title=German-grown food named likely culprit in deadly outbreak |publisher=CNN |date=5 June 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm was shut down.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN0605&quot;/&gt; Although laboratories in Lower Saxony did not detect the bacterium in produce, a laboratory in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] later found the outbreak strain in a discarded package of sprouts from the suspect farm.&lt;ref name=thelocal110611&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20110610-35583.html|title=Deadly E. coli found on bean sprouts|publisher=thelocal.de |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A control investigation confirmed the farm as the source of the outbreak.&lt;ref name=&quot;SZ116&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/ehec-epidemie-bahr-befuerchtet-weitere-todesfaelle-1.1107576|title=Bundesinstitut bestätigt Sprossen als Ehec-Quelle|publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date=11 June 2010|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 30 June 2011, the German ''Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung (BfR)'' (Federal Institute for Risk Assessment), an institute of the German [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]], announced that seeds of organic&lt;ref name=cid&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=L.

Egypt's Minister of Health Ashraf Hatem denied his nation had any patients infected with the new ''E. coli'' strain, due to the strict precautions brought in to test overseas tourists entering the country on 2 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/1/64/13507/Egypt/Politics-/No-E-coli-bacteria-in-Egypt-Ministry-of-Health-.aspx |title=No E. coli bacteria in Egypt: Ministry of Health – Politics – Egypt – Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.egypt.com/english/permalink/7824.html |title=Egypt.com News – Egypt News – No ''E. coli'' bacteria in Egypt: Ministry of Health |publisher=News.egypt.com |accessdate=9 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110710173817/http://news.egypt.com/english/permalink/7824.html| archivedate= 10 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to claims that Egyptian fenugreek seeds were the cause of the ''E. coli'' outbreak, Egyptian Minister of Agriculture Ayman Abu-Hadid told the Egyptian press the problem had nothing to do with Egypt and instead asserted, &quot;Israel is waging a commercial war against Egyptian exports.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In new Egypt, old conspiracies live on |author=David E.

===North America===
Canada and the United States reported cases of ''E. coli'' infection that had been acquired in Europe.

On 2 June, Canada brought in stricter anti ''E. coli''-related food inspections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthzone.ca/health/newsfeatures/article/1001705--canadian-experts-alarmed-at-spread-of-mutant-e-coli-in-europe?bn=1 |title=E. coli outbreak sparks beefed up Canadian food import inspections |publisher=Healthzone.ca |date=2 June 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 3 June the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] said no Canadians had been reported sick with the strain as of that date. The Canadian government also brought in heavier import and hygiene restrictions on EU cucumbers, lettuces, and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Health/20110603/canada-eurole-vegetables-coli-110603/ |title=Canadian inspectors testing Europe veggies for E. coli – CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) stated that emerging strains of ''E. coli'' are a significant problem, but regulatory bodies in the US have concentrated on the more infamous ''E. coli'' O157 serotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecolio104h4.com/e-coli-o104h4-responses-usa/ |title='&amp;#39;E. coli'&amp;#39; O104:H4 responses from the USA |publisher=Ecolio104h4.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=5 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110710165737/http://ecolio104h4.com/e-coli-o104h4-responses-usa/| archivedate= 10 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-marler/e-coli-outbreak-exporting_b_867819.html |title=William Marler: '&amp;#39;E. coli'&amp;#39; Outbreak: Exporting Bill Marler to Germany or Japan |work=Huffington Post |date= 27 May 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA noted nearly all of America's fresh produce is grown in the US and areas of Central America, and the EU has not been a significant source of fresh produce for the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6365 |title=FDA STATEMENT ON E.

===Other countries===
Other countries, including Nigeria, Hong Kong, and Thailand, expressed concern regarding imported produce.

==Economics==
By 1 June, Italian, Austrian, and French cucumber sales had begun to decline sharply, but the Austrian Health Ministry official, Dr. Pamela Rendi-Wagner, claimed Austrian customers were still safe.&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhuanet1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/video/2011-06/01/c_13905346.htm |title=Cucumber sales plummet in Europe |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June, the governments of Spain, Portugal, and Germany said they would formally request EU agricultural aid for farmers affected by the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevens |first=Laura |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303657404576362821286583788.html |title=Europe's ''E. coli'' Cases Rise |work=The Wall Street Journal |date= 4 June 2011|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day,  Russia also set up plans for new imports of cucumbers from Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Egypt, and Turkey.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.az/eng/news/main/54726.html |title=Azerbaijan Business Center – Azerbaijan gets chance to increase sharply export of vegetables to Russia |publisher=Abc.az |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hurriyetdailynews1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=russian-ban-may-support-turkish-exports-2011-06-02 |title=Russian ban may support Turkish exports – Hurriyet Daily News and Economic Review |work=Hurriyet Daily News |location=Turkey |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 7 June, the EU's farmers had reported they had lost millions of dollars in exports during the outbreak, with Fepex, Spain's fruit and vegetable industry group, saying its growers had $256,000,000 in turnover.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; French, Swiss, Bulgarian, German, Dutch, Belgian, and Portuguese producers have also been similarly affected.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

That day, the EU proposed issuing £135,000,000 in agricultural compensation to its farmers. The EU agriculture commissioner said the EU's farmers could get back up to 30% of the cost of vegetables they were unable to sell.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Walker, Adam Gabbatt and agencies |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/07/ecoli-outbreak-farmers-compensation |title=E coli: European commissioner suggests £135m payout for farmers &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 7 June 2011|accessdate=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's health commissioner, John Dalli, had formally criticised Germany earlier that day for rushing out &quot;premature conclusions&quot; about the source of an outbreak, and only helped to spread alarm among the public and farmers and untimely leading to the damaging the EU's agriculture sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Janicek |first=Karel |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43210195/ns/health-food_safety/t/e-coli-cucumbers-may-be-austria-hungary/ |title=E. coli cucumbers may be in Austria, Hungary |publisher=MSNBC |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dalli also told the EU parliament in Strasbourg that claims had to be scientifically sound, unbiased, and fool-proof in nature before it was publicised in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8561406/Germany-criticised-by-EU-health-chief-over-premature-E.coli-claims.html |title=Germany criticised by EU health chief over 'premature' E. coli claims |publisher=Telegraph |date=5 June 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain then rejected a €150,000,000/£135,000,000 the [[European Commission]]'s compensation deal for their farmers who were hit by the ''E. coli'' outbreak, on 8 June, saying it was too small.&lt;ref name=&quot;farmersguardian1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Driver |first=Alistair |url=http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/business/business-news/spain-rejects-%E2%82%AC150m-e-coli-compensation/39517.article |title=Spain rejects €150m e. coli compensation &amp;#124; News |publisher=Farmers Guardian |accessdate=9 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723221836/http://www.farmersguardian.com/home/business/business-news/spain-rejects-%E2%82%AC150m-e-coli-compensation/39517.article| archivedate= 23 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, European Union's largest agricultural grower, said it would support the plan to compensate producers hurt by the outbreak, according to the French Agriculture Minister [[Bruno Le Maire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;connolly1&quot;/&gt;

Ministers from both EU and Russia were scheduled to meet on 8 June over Russia's earlier decision to ban all its vegetable imports from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0608/russia.html |title=EU increases E coli compensation offer – RTÉ News |publisher=Rte.ie |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June, the EU's  ''E. coli'' O104:H4 outbreak was estimated to have cost $2,840,000,000 in human losses (such as sick leave), regardless of material losses (such as dumped cucumbers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/foodborne-illness-outbreaks/german-e-coli-o104h4-outbreak---284-billion-in-human-damage/ |title=German E. coli O104:H4 Outbreak – $2.84 Billion in Human Damage : Food Poison Journal : Food Poisoning Lawyer &amp; Attorney : Bill Marler : Marler Clark |publisher=Food Poison Journal |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers across Europe were shunning fruit and vegetables ''en masse'' by 8 June, as the German government's edict against eating raw cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce and sprouts remained on.  EU farmers claimed to have losses up to C$417,000,000 a week as ripe vegetables rotted in their fields and warehouses.&lt;ref name=&quot;EdmontonCTV110608&quot;&gt;[http://edmonton.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110608/germany-e-coli-cases-110608?hub=EdmontonHome CTV Edmonton – Cucumbers suspected again in European E. coli outbreak – CTV News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 June, The EU Farm Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said the EU had increased its offer of compensation to farmers for the losses caused by ''E. coli'' outbreak to C$210,000,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;EdmontonCTV110608&quot;/&gt;
