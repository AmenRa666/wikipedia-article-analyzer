==Music career==

===Jack Off Jill (1992–2000)===
{{main article|Jack Off Jill}}

Jessica Fodera met Tenni Arslanyan while attending high school in Sunrise, Florida.Jessicka was the first to spell her name with a c and a k. She added the &quot;K&quot; to the original spelling of her first name and dropped her surname, paying homage to [[Magick (Book 4)]], by [[Aleister Crowley]]. They had begun writing songs, but had not yet formed a complete band when [[Robin Moulder]] and Michelle Oliver joined them to create the band Jack In Jill. In 1992, Jack In Jill got their start when they were asked to open for fellow Floridian and friend [[Marilyn Manson]] and his band, [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids]] at a [[Davie, Florida]] nightclub called The Plus 5 Lounge. Manson suggested a name change to ''[[Jack Off Jill]]'' (JOJ).&lt;ref&gt;Kissel, Ted. [http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1999-01-21/news/manson-the-early-years Manson: The Early Years] Miami New Times, January 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV.com1&quot;&gt;''MTV.com1'':[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430051/19990322/hole.jhtml MTV news March 22, 1999]&quot;.

In December 1993 while on tour, Jessicka spent a night in jail when she and Manson were arrested after a concert in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], for breaking the town's adult entertainment codes.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Greg. http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1995-01-05/news/program-notes-38 Miami New Times, January 5, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marini, Leslie R.

Before her 21st birthday, Jessicka's record label, Rectum Records, had released several independent JOJ records and several [[Single (music)|7&quot; singles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jackoffjill.com/discography/index.htm l Jack Off Jill discography]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jack Off Jill signed with Los Angeles-based Risk Records in January 1997. The band released their first full-length album, ''Sexless Demons And Scars'', in September 1997 then toured in the U.S. and Canada.

JOJ played its last show at Los Angeles' [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in April 2000. They were joined onstage by guitarist [[Helen Storer]] of the UK band [[Fluffy (band)|Fluffy]] and producer [[Chris Vrenna]] on drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Tina |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430390/04072000/jack_off_jill.jhtml |title=MTV news March 04, 2000 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2000-04-07 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; JOJ officially went on hiatus in late 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackoffjill.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackoffjill.com/alumni/jessicka.html |title=The OFFICIAL Jack Off Jill – Website :: Archive :: Store |publisher=Jackoffjill.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Scarling.}}

After taking a break from the music industry and making Los Angeles her permanent residence, Jessicka was invited in 2001 by guitarist [[Christian Hejnal]] to be a guest vocalist on his solo album. The pair had only met a few months earlier through a mutual friend, Lisa Leveridge. They began recording and rehearsing together and eventually recruited the musicians who would form the first and very short-lived lineup of Scarling.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagomusicguide.com&quot;/&gt; In early 2002 Jessicka was introduced to [[Long Gone John]], owner of [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]], by mutual friend [[Mark Ryden]].
