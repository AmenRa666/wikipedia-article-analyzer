The '''African golden wolf''' (''Canis anthus''), also known as the '''golden wolf''', '''African wolf''' or '''thoa''', is a [[canid]] native to [[North Africa|north]] and [[Horn of Africa|northeastern Africa]]. The species is common in [[North Africa|north]]-[[West Africa|west]] and north-[[east Africa]], occurring from [[Senegal]] to [[Egypt]] in the east, in a range including [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], and [[Libya]] in the north to [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]] and [[Tanzania]] in the south.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{IUCN2008|assessor=Jhala, Y.V.|assessor2=Moehlman, P.D.|last-assessor-amp=yes|year=2008|id=3744|title=Canis aureus|downloaded=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a desert-adapted canid, and is common in plains and steppe areas, including ones lacking abundant water.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt; In the [[Atlas Mountains]], the species has been sighted in elevations as high as 1,800 metres.&lt;ref name=&quot;tarik2013&quot;/&gt; It is primarily a predator, targeting [[invertebrate]]s and [[mammal]]s as large as [[gazelle]] fawns, though larger animals are sometimes taken. Other foodstuffs include animal carcasses, human refuse, and fruit. The African wolf is a monogamous and territorial animal, whose social structure includes yearling offspring remaining with the family to assist in raising their parents' younger pups.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;&gt;Estes, Richard (1992). &quot;The behavior guide to African mammals: including hoofed mammals, carnivores, primates&quot;. University of California Press. pp. 398–404. ISBN 0-520-08085-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was previously classified as an African variant of the Eurasian [[golden jackal]], with at least one subspecies (''Canis anthus lupaster'') having been classified as a [[gray wolf|grey wolf]]. In 2015, a series of analyses on the species' [[mitochondrial DNA]] and [[Nuclear DNA|nuclear]] [[genome]] demonstrated that it was in fact distinct from both the golden jackal and the grey wolf, and more closely related to grey wolves and [[coyote]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;koepfli&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;urios2015&quot;/&gt; It is nonetheless still close enough to the golden jackal to [[Canid hybrid|produce hybrid offspring]], as indicated through genetic tests on jackals in Israel&lt;ref name=&quot;koepfli&quot;/&gt; and a 19th-century captive crossbreeding experiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuvier3&quot;/&gt; As the [[IUCN]]'s golden jackal page has not been updated since 2008, it has yet to recognise the distinctiveness of the African wolf; thus its [[conservation status]] has not been evaluated, and no reliable population estimates are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2015/jul/30/golden-jackal-a-new-wolf-species-hiding-in-plain-sight Golden jackal: A new wolf species hiding in plain sight], ''The Guardian'', (30 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

It plays a prominent role in some African cultures; in [[Greater Maghreb|Maghreb]] and Egyptian folklore, it is viewed as an untrustworthy animal whose body parts can be used for medicinal or ritualistic purposes,&lt;ref name=&quot;osborn1980&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bidwell2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;westermarck2013&quot;/&gt; while it is held in high esteem in [[Senegal]]'s [[Serer religion]] as being the first creature to be created by the god [[Roog]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gavrand1990&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Journal.pone.0042740.g006.png|left|thumb|Various ''C. anthus'' [[phenotype]]s, ranging from gracile jackal-like morphs to more robust wolf-like ones.]]
The African wolf is a small canid, with both sexes weighing {{convert|7|–|15|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and standing 40&amp;nbsp;cm in height. It has a relatively long snout and ears, while the tail is comparatively short, measuring 20&amp;nbsp;cm in length. Fur colour varies individually, seasonally and geographically, though the typical colouration is yellowish to silvery grey, with slightly reddish limbs and black speckling on the tail and shoulders. The throat, abdomen and facial markings are usually white, and the eyes are amber coloured. Females bear two to four pairs of teats.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt; Although superficially similar to the [[Eurasian golden jackal]] (particularly in East Africa), the African golden wolf has a more pointed muzzle and sharper, more robust teeth.&lt;ref name=&quot;koepfli&quot;/&gt; The ears are longer in the African wolf, and the skull has a more elevated forehead.&lt;ref name=&quot;mivart41&quot;&gt;Mivart, George (1890), ''[https://archive.org/stream/dogsjackalswolve00mivauoft#page/n115/mode/2up Dogs, Jackals, Wolves and Foxes: A Monograph of the Canidæ]'', R.H.

[[Aristotle]] wrote of wolves living in Egypt, mentioning that they were smaller than the Greek kind. [[Georg Ebers]] wrote of the wolf being among the sacred animals of Egypt, describing it as a &quot;smaller variety&quot; of wolf to those of Europe, and noting how the name [[Lykopolis]], the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian city dedicated to [[Anubis]], means &quot;city of the wolf&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rueness2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson1981&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ferguson, W.W.|year= 1981|title= The systematic of ''Canis aureus lupaster'' (Carnivora : Canidae) and the occurrence of ''Canis lupus'' in North Africa, Egypt and Sinai|journal= Mammalia |volume=4|pages= 459–465|doi=10.1515/mamm.1981.45.4.459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African golden wolf was first recognised as being a separate species from the Eurasian golden jackal by [[Frédéric Cuvier]] in 1820, who described it as being a more elegant animal, with a more melodic voice and a less strong odour. The [[binomial name]] he chose for it was derived from the [[Arcadia]]n [[Anthus (mythology)|Anthus]] family described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', whose members would draw lots to become [[Werewolf|werewolves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cuvier&quot;&gt;{{fr icon}} Cuvier, Frédéric (1824), ''[https://archive.org/stream/HistoirenaturelIIGeof#page/n33/mode/2up Histoire naturelle des mammifères]'', tome 2, A Paris : Chez A. Belin ...&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eduard Rüppell]] proposed that the animal was the ancestor of Egyptian [[sighthound]]s, and named it ''Wolf's-hund'' (wolf dog),&lt;ref name=&quot;ruppell1826&quot;&gt;{{de icon}} Rüppell, Eduard (1826), ''[https://archive.org/stream/atlaszuderreisei00rupp#page/n95/mode/2up Atlas zu der Reise im nördlichen Afrika]'', Frankfurt am Main : Gedruckt und in Commission bei Heinr. Ludw. Brönner, pp. 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Charles Hamilton Smith]] named it &quot;thoa&quot; or &quot;thous dog&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith1839&quot;&gt;Smith, Charles Hamilton; Jardine, Sir William (1839).

Edinburgh : W. H. Lizars. pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt was also made in 1821 to hybridise the two species in captivity, resulting in the birth of five pups, three of which died before weaning. The two survivors were noted to never play with each other and had completely contrasting temperaments; one inherited the golden jackal's shyness, while the other was affectionate toward its human captors.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuvier3&quot;&gt;{{fr icon}} Cuvier, Frédéric (1824), ''[https://archive.org/stream/HistoirenaturelIIIGeof#page/n243/mode/2up Histoire naturelle des mammifères]'', tome 3, A Paris : Chez A. Belin ...&lt;/ref&gt; English biologist [[St. George Jackson Mivart]] emphasised the differences between the African wolf and the golden jackal in his writings:
[[File:Histoire naturelle des mammifères, t. 3 (1824) Canis anthus x aureus.png|thumb|Illustration of golden jackal-African wolf hybrids bred in captivity (1821).]]
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;it is a nice question whether the Common Jackal of North Africa should or should not be regarded as of the same species [as the golden jackal]... Certainly the differences of coloration which exist between these forms is not nearly so great as those which are to be found to occur between the different local varieties of ''C. lupus''. We are nevertheless inclined... to keep the North-African and Indian Jackals distinct... The reasons why we prefer to keep them provisionally distinct is that though the difference between the two forms (African and Indian) is slight as regards coloration, yet it appears to be a very constant one. Out of seventeen skins of the Indian form, we have only found one which is wanting in the main characteristic as to difference of hue. The ears also are relatively shorter than in the North-African form. But there is another character to which we attach greater weight. However much the different races of Wolves differ in size, we have not succeeded in finding any constant distinctive characters in the form of the skull or the proportions of the lobes of any of the teeth. So far as we have been able to observe, such differences do exist between the Indian and North-African Jackals.|Mivart (1890)&lt;ref name=&quot;mivart36&quot;&gt;Mivart, George (1890), [https://archive.org/stream/dogsjackalswolve00mivauoft#page/36/mode/2up ''Dogs, Jackals, Wolves and Foxes: A Monograph of the Canidæ''], R.H. Porter, London, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The canids present in Egypt in particular were noted to be so much more grey wolf-like than populations elsewhere in Africa that [[Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich|Hemprich]] and [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg]] gave them the [[binomial name]] ''Canis lupaster'' in 1832. Likewise, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], upon noting the similarities between the skulls of ''lupaster'' and [[Indian wolf|Indian grey wolves]], classed the animal as a subspecies of grey wolf. However, the animal was subsequently [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymised]] with the golden jackal by [[Ernst Schwarz]] in 1926. This classification remained unquestioned until 1981, when zoologist Walter Ferguson of [[Tel Aviv University]] argued in favour of ''lupaster'' being a subspecies of grey wolf based on cranial measurements, stating that the classing of the animal as a jackal was based solely on the animal's small size, and predated the discovery of ''[[Arabian wolf|C. l. arabs]]'', which is intermediate in size between ''[[Eurasian wolf|C. l. lupus]]'' and ''lupaster''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferguson1981&quot; /&gt;

===21st-century discoveries===
Further doubts over its being conspecific with the golden jackal of Eurasia arose in December 2002, when a canid was sighted in [[Eritrea]]'s [[Danakil Desert]] whose appearance didn't correspond to that of the golden jackal or the six other recognised species of the area, but strongly resembled that of the grey wolf. The area had previously been largely unexplored because of its harsh climate and embroilment in the [[Eritrean War of Independence]] and subsequent [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]], though local [[Afar people|Afar]] tribesmen knew of the animal, and referred to it as ''wucharia'' (wolf).&lt;ref name=&quot;tiwari2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tiwari | first1 = J.

The animal's wolf-like qualities were confirmed in 2011, when several golden &quot;jackal&quot; populations in Egypt and the Horn of Africa classed as ''Canis aureus lupaster'' were found to have [[mtDNA]] sequences more closely resembling those found in [[Gray wolf|grey wolves]] than those of golden jackals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rueness2011&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rueness | first1 = E.

Furthermore, the sampled African specimens displayed much more [[nucleotide]] and [[haplotype]] diversity than that present in Indian and Himalayan grey wolves, thus indicating a larger ancestral population, and an effective extant population of around 80,000 females. Both these studies proposed reclassifying ''Canis aureus lupaster'' as a subspecies of grey wolf.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaubert2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Gaubert P, Bloch C, Benyacoub S, Abdelhamid A, Pagani P, etal |year=2012|title= Reviving the African Wolf ''Canis lupus lupaster'' in North and West Africa: A Mitochondrial Lineage Ranging More than 6,000 km Wide|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=8|page=e42740|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042740|pmid=22900047|pmc=3416759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a more thorough comparative study of mitochondrial and [[Nuclear DNA|nuclear]] [[genome]]s on a larger sample of wolf-like African canids from north, east and west Africa showed that they were in fact all distinct from the Eurasian golden jackal, with a [[genetic divergence]] of around 6.7%,&lt;ref name=&quot;koepfli&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koepfli|first1=K.-P.|last2= Pollinger|first2=J.|last3= Godinho|first3=R.|last4= Robinson|first4=J.|last5= Lea|first5=A.|last6= Hendricks|first6=S.|last7= Schweizer|first7=R.

It was estimated that the African golden wolf diverged from the wolf–coyote clade 1.0–1.7 million years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]], and therefore its superficial similarity to the Eurasian golden jackal (particularly in East Africa, where African wolves are similar in size to golden jackals) would be a case of [[parallel evolution]]. Considering its phylogenetic position and the canid [[fossil record]], it is likely that the African wolf evolved from larger ancestors that became progressively more jackal-like in size upon populating Africa on account of [[interspecific competition]] with both larger and smaller indigenous [[Carnivora|carnivores]]. Traces of golden wolf DNA were identified in golden jackals in [[Israel]], which adjoins Egypt, thus indicating the presence of a hybrid zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;koepfli&quot;/&gt; The study's findings were corroborated that same year by Spanish, Mexican and Moroccan scientists analysing the mtDNA of wolves in Morocco, who found that the specimens analysed were distinct from both Eurasian golden jackals and grey wolves but bore a closer relationship to the latter.&lt;ref name=&quot;urios2015&quot;&gt;{{es icon}} Urios, Vicente; Donat-Torres, Maria P.; Ramírez, Carlos; Monroy-Vilchis, Octavio; Hamid Rgribi-Idrissi (2015): [http://figshare.com/articles/El_an_lisis_del_genoma_mitocondrial_del_c_nido_estudiado_en_Marruecos_manifiesta_que_no_es_ni_lobo_Canis_lupus_ni_chacal_euroasi_tico_Canis_aureus_/1524971 El análisis del genoma mitocondrial del cánido estudiado en Marruecos manifiesta que no es ni lobo (Canis lupus) ni chacal euroasiático (Canis aureus)]. figshare.

===Subspecies===
As of 2015, [[MSW3]] still classifies the six African wolf subspecies as part of ''Canis aureus''.&lt;ref name=MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Wozencraft | id=14000707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in the past several attempts have been made to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymise]] many of the proposed names, the taxonomic position of West African wolves, in particular, is too confused to come to any precise conclusion, as the collected study materials are few. Prior to 1840, six of the ten supposed West African subspecies were named or classed almost entirely because of their fur colour.&lt;ref name=&quot;r38&quot;&gt;Rosevear, Donovan Reginald (1974). &quot;The carnivores of West Africa&quot;. London : Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History). pp. 38–44. ISBN 1-175-10030-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The species' display of high individual variation, coupled with the scarcity of samples and the lack of physical barriers on the continent preventing [[gene flow]], brings into question the validity of some of the West African forms.&lt;ref name=&quot;r38&quot;/&gt;

==Behaviour==

===Social and reproductive behaviours===
The African wolf's social organisation is extremely flexible, varying according to the availability and distribution of food. The basic social unit is a breeding pair, followed by its current offspring, or offspring from previous litters staying as &quot;helpers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jhala2004&quot;/&gt; Large groups are rare, and have only been recorded to occur in areas with abundant human waste. Family relationships among African wolves are comparatively peaceful compared to those of the [[black-backed jackal]]; although the sexual and territorial behaviour of grown pups is suppressed by the breeding pair, they are not actively driven off once they attain adulthood. African wolves also lie together and groom each other much more frequently than black-backed jackals. In the Serengeti, pairs defend permanent territories encompassing 2–4&amp;nbsp;km², and will vacate their territories only to drink or when lured by a large carcass.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt; The pair patrols and [[territorial marking|marks its territory]] in tandem. Both partners and helpers will react aggressively towards intruders, though the greatest aggression is reserved for intruders of the same sex; pair members do not assist each other in repelling intruders of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Canis anthus threat postures.png|thumb|Threat postures in ''C. a. lupaster'' (left) and ''C. a. anthus'' (right)]]
The African wolf's courtship rituals are remarkably long, during which the breeding pair remains almost constantly together. Prior to mating, the pair patrols and [[scent mark]]s its territory. [[Animal sexual behavior|Copulation]] is preceded by the female holding her tail out and angled in such a way that her genitalia are exposed. The two approach each other, whimpering, lifting their tails and bristling their fur, displaying varying intensities of offensive and defensive behaviour. The female sniffs and licks the male's genitals, whilst the male nuzzles the female's fur. They may circle each other and fight briefly. The [[copulatory tie]] lasts roughly four minutes. Towards the end of estrus, the pair drifts apart, with the female often approaching the male in a comparatively more submissive manner. In anticipation of the role he will take in raising pups, the male regurgitates or surrenders any food he has to the female. In the Serengeti, pups are born in December–January, and begin eating solid food after a month. [[Weaning]] starts at the age of two months, and ends at four months. At this stage, the pups are semi-independent, venturing up to 50 metres from the den, even sleeping in the open. Their playing behaviour becomes increasingly more aggressive, with the pups competing for rank, which is established after six months. The female feeds the pups more frequently than the male or helpers do, though the presence of the latter allows the breeding pair to leave the den and hunt without leaving the litter unprotected.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt;

The African wolf's life centres around a home burrow, which usually consists of an abandoned and modified [[aardvark]] or [[warthog]] earth. The interior structure of this burrow is poorly understood, though it is thought to consist of a single central chamber with 2–3 escape routes. The home burrow can be located in both secluded areas or surprisingly near the dens of other predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;r47&quot;/&gt;

===Communication===
African wolves frequently groom one another, particularly during courtship, during which it can last up to ½ hour. Nibbling of the face and neck is observed during greeting ceremonies. When fighting, the African wolf slams its opponents with its hips, and bites and shakes the shoulder. The species' postures are typically canine, and it has more facial mobility than the black-backed and side-striped jackals, being able to expose its canine teeth like a dog.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt;

The vocabulary of the African wolf is similar to that of the domestic dog, with seven sounds having been recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;kingdon1988&quot;/&gt; The African wolf's vocalisations include howls, barks, growls, whines and cackles.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt; Subspecies can be recognised by differences in their howls.&lt;ref name=&quot;kingdon1988&quot;/&gt; One of the most commonly heard sounds is a high, keening wail, of which there are three varieties; a long single toned continuous howl, a wail that rises and falls, and a series of short, staccato howls. These howls are used to repel intruders and attract family members. Howling in chorus is thought to reinforce family bonds, as well as establish territorial status.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt;

===Hunting behaviour===
[[File:Golden Wolf, navigating Wildebeest, Ngorongoro.jpg|thumb|right|A Serengeti wolf (''C. a. bea'') navigating through a herd of [[blue wildebeest]] in the [[Ngorongoro National Park]], [[Tanzania]]]]
The African wolf rarely catches hares, due to their speed. [[Gazelle]] mothers (often working in groups of two or three) are formidable when defending their young against single wolves, which are much more successful in hunting gazelle fawns when working in pairs. A pair of wolves will methodically search for concealed gazelle fawns within herds, tall grass, bushes and other likely hiding places.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt;

Although it is known to kill animals up to three times its own weight, the African wolf targets mammalian prey much less frequently than the [[black-backed jackal]] overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt; On capturing large prey, the African wolf makes no attempt to kill it; instead it rips open the belly and eats the entrails. Small prey is typically killed by shaking, though snakes may be eaten alive from the tail end. The African wolf often carries away more food than it can consume, and [[hoarding (animal behavior)|caches]] the surplus, which is generally recovered within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;r47&quot;/&gt; When foraging for insects, the African wolf turns over dung piles to find dung beetles. During the dry seasons, it excavates dung balls to reach the larvae inside. Grasshoppers and flying termites are caught either by pouncing on them while they are on the ground or are caught in mid-air. It is fiercely intolerant of other scavengers, having been known to dominate [[Old World Vulture|vultures]] on kills – one can hold dozens of vultures at bay by threatening, snapping and lunging at them.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt;

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
The African wolf inhabits a number of different habitats; in Algeria it lives in [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], coastal and hilly areas (including hedged farmlands, scrublands, pinewoods and oak forests), while populations in Senegal inhabit [[Tropical climate|tropical]], semi-arid climate zones including [[Sahel]]ian savannahs. Wolf populations in [[Mali]] have been documented in arid Sahelian [[massif]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaubert2012&quot;/&gt; In [[Egypt]], the African wolf inhabits agricultural areas, wastelands, desert margins, rocky areas, and cliffs. At [[Lake Nasser]], it lives close to the lakeshore.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoath2009&quot;/&gt; In 2012, African wolves were photographed in [[Morocco]]'s [[Azilal Province]] at an elevation of 1,800 metres.&lt;ref name=&quot;tarik2013&quot;&gt;{{fr icon}} Rachid Tarik, [http://www.lematin.ma/reader/files/lematin/2013/04/29/files/assets/basic-html/page18.html &quot;Le loup apparaît dans la région d'Azilal&quot;]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Le Matin'' (April 29, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Moliner, V.

===Diet===
[[File:Golden wolf eating agama.jpg|thumb|Serengeti wolf (''C. a. bea'') eating an [[agama (lizard)|agama]]]]
In [[West Africa]], the African wolf mostly confines itself to small prey, such as [[hare]]s, [[rat]]s, [[ground squirrel]]s and [[Cane rat|grass cutters]]. Other prey items include lizards, snakes, and ground-nesting birds, such as [[francolin]]s and [[bustard]]s. It also consumes a large amount of insects, including [[dung beetle]]s, [[larvae]], [[termite]]s and [[grasshopper]]s. It will also kill young [[gazelle]]s, [[duiker]]s and [[warthog]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;r47&quot;&gt;Rosevear, Donovan Reginald (1974). &quot;The carnivores of West Africa&quot;. London : Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History). pp. 46–47. ISBN 1-175-10030-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In East Africa, it consumes invertebrates and fruit, though 60% of its diet consists of rodents, lizards, snakes, birds, hares and [[Thomson's gazelle]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;jhala2004&quot;&gt;Jhala, Y. V. &amp; Moehlman, P. D. 2004. [http://www.canids.org/species/Golden_jackal.pdf Golden jackal ''Canis aureus'']. In Sillero-Zubiri, C., Hoffman, M. &amp; MacDonald, D. W., ed., ''Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals and Dogs - 2004 Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan'', 156-161. IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group, ISBN 2-8317-0786-2&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[wildebeest]] calving season, African wolves will feed almost exclusively on their [[afterbirth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kingdon1988&quot;/&gt; In the [[Serengeti]] and Ngorongoro Crater, less than 20% of its diet comes from scavenging.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt; In Senegal, where both ''C. a. anthus'' and ''C. a. lupaster'' coexist, some degree of [[niche segregation]] is apparent in their choice of prey; the former is reputed to feed primarily on lambs, whereas the latter attacks larger prey, such as sheep, goats and cattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaubert2012&quot;/&gt;

===Enemies and competitors===
The African wolf generally manages to avoid competing with [[Black-backed jackal|black-backed]] and [[side-striped jackal]]s by occupying a different habitat (grassland, as opposed to the closed and open woodlands favoured by the latter two species) and being more active during the daytime.&lt;ref name=&quot;fuller&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fuller | first1 = T.K. | last2 = Biknevicius | first2 = A.R. | last3 = Kat | first3 = P.W. | last4 = Van Valkenburgh | first4 = B. | last5 = Wayne | first5 = R.K. | year = 1989 | title = The ecology of three sympatric jackal species in the rift valley of kenya | url = | journal = African Journal of Ecology | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 313–323 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2028.1989.tb01025.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the African wolf has been known to kill the pups of black-backed jackals,&lt;ref name=&quot;jhala2004&quot;/&gt; but has in turn been observed to be dominated by adults during disputes over carcasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;kingdon1988&quot;/&gt; It often eats alongside [[African wild dog]]s, and will stand its ground if the dogs try to harass it.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt; Encounters with [[Ethiopian wolf|Ethiopian wolves]] are usually agonistic, with Ethiopian wolves dominating African wolves if the latter enter their territories, and vice versa. Although African wolves are inefficient rodent hunters and thus not in direct competition with Ethiopian wolves, it is likely that heavy human persecution prevents the former from attaining numbers large enough to completely displace the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Gutema, T. M.,  [http://www.rufford.org/files/16215-1%20Detailed%20Final%20Report.pdf Foraging ecology and trophic niche overlap between sympatric African wolf and Ethiopian wolf in the Ethiopian Highlands], ''The Rufford Foundation'' (November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is at least one record of an African wolf pack adopting a male Ethiopian wolf.&lt;ref name=&quot;zm1994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sillero-Zubiri | first1 = C. | last2 = Gottelli | first2 = D. | year = 1994 | title = Canis simensis | url = http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-485-01-0001.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Mammalian Species | volume = 385 | issue = | pages = 1–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolves will feed alongside [[spotted hyena]]s, though they will be chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating one. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other when no food or young is at stake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kruuk&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kruuk |first=Hans |year=1972 |title=The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behaviour |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-45507-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolves will confront a hyena approaching too closely to their dens by taking turns in biting the hyena's [[Hock (anatomy)|hocks]] until it retreats.&lt;ref name=&quot;estes1992&quot;/&gt;

Wolves in the Serengeti are known to carry the [[canine parvovirus]], [[canine herpesvirus]], [[canine coronavirus]] and [[canine adenovirus]].&lt;ref name=jhala2004/&gt;

==Range and status==
In [[Tanzania]], the African wolf is limited to a small area of the north between the western slopes of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and the centre of the [[Serengeti]]. In the latter area, it occurs mostly in the short-grass plains, the floor of the [[Ngorongoro Crater]], and the plains between the Olmoti and Empakai Craters, being relatively rare in [[Serengeti National Park]], [[Loliondo]] and the [[Maswa District|Maswa]] game reserve. The species also inhabits the [[Lake Natron]] area and West Kilimanjaro. It is sometimes found in the northern part of [[Arusha National Park]], and as far south as [[Manyara Region|Manyara]]. In areas where it is common, such as the short-grass plains of Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater, population densities can range between 0.5-1.5 specimens per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A population decrease of 60% has been recorded in the southern plains of Serengeti National Park since the early 1970s, though the reasons are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, C. et al. (2014), ''A Field Guide to the Larger Mammals of Tanzania'', Princeton University Press, pp. 102-103, ISBN 1400852803&lt;/ref&gt;

==In folklore==
[[File:Amulet of a Jackal LACMA 45.23.31.jpg|thumb|Wolf-shaped bronze amulet from Egypt's Ptolemaic Period (711 - 30 BCE).]]
The wolf was the template of numerous [[Ancient Egyptian deities]], including [[Anubis]], [[Wepwawet]] and [[Duamutef]].&lt;ref&gt;Remler, P. (2010), ''Egyptian Mythology, A to Z'', Infobase Publishing, p. 99, ISBN 1438131801&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], the Egyptian city of [[Lykopolis]] was named in honour of a pack of wolves that repelled an Ethiopian invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Anne (1973), ''Diodorus Siculus, Book 1: A Commentary'', BRILL, p.259, ISBN 9004035141&lt;/ref&gt; Arab Egyptian folklore holds that the wolf can cause chickens to faint from fear by simply passing underneath their roosts, and associates its body parts with various forms of folk magic: placing a wolf's tongue in a house is believed to cause the inhabitants to argue, and its meat is thought to be useful in treating insanity and epilepsy. Its heart is believed to protect the bearer from wild animal attacks, while its eye can protect against the [[evil eye]].&lt;ref name=&quot;osborn1980&quot;/&gt;

Although considered ''[[haram]]'' in Islamic dietary laws, the wolf is important in Moroccan folk medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;bidwell2005&quot;&gt;Bidwell, M. &amp; Bidwell, R. (2005), ''The Traveller's Companion'', Second Edition, Tauris Parke Paperbacks, p. 228, ISBN 1845111079&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edvard Westermarck]] wrote of several remedies derived from the wolf in Morocco, including the use of its fat as a lotion, the consumption of its meat to treat respiratory ailments, and the burning of its intestines in fumigation rituals meant to increase the fertility of married couples. The wolf's [[gall bladder]] was said to have various uses, including curing sexual impotence and serving as a charm for women wishing to divorce their husbands. Westermarck noted, however, that the wolf was also associated with more nefarious qualities: it was said that a child who eats wolf flesh before reaching puberty will be forever cursed with misfortune and that scribes and saintly persons refrain from consuming it even in areas where it is socially acceptable, as doing so would render their charms useless.&lt;ref name=&quot;westermarck2013&quot;&gt;[[Edvard Westermarck|Westermarck, E.]] (2013), ''Ritual and Belief in Morocco: Vol. II'', Routledge Revivals, ISBN 1317912616&lt;/ref&gt;

The African wolf isn't common in Neolithic rock art, though it does occasionally appear; a definite portrayal is shown on the Kef Messiouer cave in Algeria's [[Tébessa Province]], where it is shown feeding on a wild boar carcass alongside a lion pride. It plays a role in [[Traditional Berber religion|Berber mythology]], particularly that of the [[Ait Seghrouchen]] of Morocco, where it plays a similar role in folktales as the red fox does in Medieval European fables, though it is often the victim of the more cunning [[hedgehog]].&lt;ref name=&quot;camps1993&quot;&gt;G. Trécolle &amp; G. Camps, « Chacal », in 12 | Capsa – Cheval, Aix-en-Provence, Edisud (« Volumes », no 12) , 1993 [online], published online 1 March 2012, consulted 19 November 2015. URL : http://

The wolf plays a prominent role in the [[Serer religion]]'s [[Serer creation myth|creation myth]], where it is viewed as the first living creature created by [[Roog]], the Supreme God and Creator.&lt;ref name=&quot;gavrand1990&quot;&gt;{{fr icon}} Gravrand, Henry (1990), &quot;La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool&quot;, vol. 2. ''Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal'', pp. 201−203, ISBN 2-7236-1055-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thiaw&quot;&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Issa Laye Thiaw|Thiaw, Issa laye]], &quot;Mythe de la création du monde selon les sages sereer&quot;, pp. 45−50, 59−61 [in] &quot;Enracinement et Ouverture&quot; – &quot;Plaidoyer pour le dialogue interreligieux&quot;, [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation|Konrad Adenauer Stiftung]] (23–24 June 2009), Dakar&lt;/ref&gt; In one aspect, it can be viewed as an [[Earth-diver]] sent to Earth by Roog, in another, as a fallen [[prophet]] for disobeying the laws of the divine. The wolf was the first intelligent creature on earth, and it is believed that it will remain on earth after human beings have returned to the divine. The Serers believe that, not only does it know in advance who will die, but it traces the tracks in advance of those who will go to funerals. The movements of the wolf are carefully observed, because the animal is viewed as a [[Clairvoyance|seer]] who came from the transcendence and maintains links with it. Although believed to be rejected in the bush by other animals and deprived of its original intelligence, it is still respected because it dared to resist the supreme being who still keeps it alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;gavrand1990&quot;/&gt;
