The first season of the [[fantasy]] [[television drama|drama]] television series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' premiered on [[HBO]] on April 17, 2011, and concluded on June 19, 2011, airing on Sunday at 9:00 pm in the United States.  Helmed by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], the original pilot was shot in late 2009, and despite some recasting, much of that footage was used in the first episode of the completed season.

The season consists of 10 episodes, each running approximately 55 minutes. ''Game of Thrones'' is based on ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', the first novel in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series by [[George R. R. Martin]]. The story takes place in a [[fictional world]], primarily upon a continent called [[Westeros]], with one story line occurring on another continent to the east known as [[Essos]].

The first cast member publicly announced was [[Peter Dinklage]], with a variety of industry veterans such as [[Sean Bean]], [[Mark Addy]], and [[Lena Headey]] soon joining the show. A series of relatively newer actors were cast as the novel's younger generation of characters.

The show was filmed primarily in Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Malta. Critics praised the show's production values and cast, with specific accolades for Dinklage's portrayal of [[Tyrion Lannister]].  Viewership rose by approximately 33% over the course of the season. It won 2 of the 13 [[Emmy Awards]] for which it was nominated, for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (Dinklage) and Outstanding Main Title Design.

{{See also|A Song of Ice and Fire#Plot_synopsis|l1=Synopsis of A Song of Ice and Fire}}

The cable television series closely adapts the multiple story lines of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novel series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.georgerrmartin.com/hbo-options-ice-fire/ |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.georgerrmartin.com/hbo-options-ice-fire/ |title=HBO Options Fire &amp; Ice |publisher=George R.R.

Ned and his wife Catelyn ([[Michelle Fairley]]) receive a letter from Catelyn's sister, Lysa ([[Kate Dickie]]) that gives them reason to believe that rival House Lannister – to which the King's wife Cersei belongs – was the cause of the previous Hand's death. Ned must travel south to help the king and find out who killed the previous Hand of the King, Jon Arryn ([[John Standing]]), while trying to protect his family from the Lannisters. As he tries to uncover the reasons behind Jon Arryn's death he uncovers the dark secrets about the Lannisters that Arryn himself died trying to expose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Month/2008/07/ |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Month/2008/07/ |title=The Citadel: So Spake Martin |publisher=Westeros.org |date=July 27, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea in the continent of Essos, the exiled, arrogant Viserys Targaryen ([[Harry Lloyd]]), son of the former king whose throne was usurped, believes he still has the rightful claim to the throne. He marries off his younger sister, Daenerys Targaryen ([[Emilia Clarke]]), whom he has psychologically and physically abused for years, to the leader of the Dothraki warrior tribe, Khal Drogo ([[Jason Momoa]]), in an exchange for an army to return to Westeros and take the throne. However, Daenerys' growing love for Drogo and newfound mental strength as the Khaleesi of the tribe mean Viserys' plans go unexpectedly and powerfully offset.

And at the wall, Ned's bastard son Jon Snow joins the Night's Watch, an ancient brotherhood sworn to watch over the massive Wall that separates the Seven Kingdoms from the dangerous unknown beyond. But an ancient force, long believed dead, threatens the land.

In the Wall, Joer gives his family sword to Snow in gratitude of saving the former. Maester Aemon reveals to him that he is a Targaryen. In Essos, Drogo's wound becomes infectious, with his death imminent. Daenerys convinces a slave woman to use blood magic to save him. The woman tells everyone to leave the tent and stay outside until the spell is over. Daenerys begins her process of labor; and Jorah is forced to enter the tent so that the woman can help her.

==Production==
HBO originally optioned the rights to ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' in 2007, at which time 
[[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] were identified as the project's writers and executive producers.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news|url=http://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/hbo-turns-fire-into-fantasy-series-1117957532/|author=Fleming, Michael|date=January 16, 2007|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=HBO turns ‘Fire’ into fantasy series|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and second drafts of the [[pilot episode|pilot]] script, written by Benioff and Weiss, were submitted in August 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918120407/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6468840.html%20Publishers%20Weekly%20interview |archivedate=September 18, 2016 |last=Hudson |first=Laura |title=Talking with George R.

Benioff and Weiss served as main writers and [[showrunners]] for the first season. They contributed eight out of ten episodes, including one co-written with [[Jane Espenson]]. The two remaining episodes were written by [[Bryan Cogman]] and ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' author [[George R.R. Martin]].

[[Thomas McCarthy (actor)|Tom McCarthy]] directed the original pilot, but much of this was later re-shot by [[Timothy Van Patten|Tim Van Patten]] as the pilot was reworked into the first episode of the complete season. Van Patten also directed the second episode. McCarthy is still credited as a consulting producer for the series' first episode. [[Brian Kirk]] and [[Daniel Minahan]] directed three episodes each, and [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]] directed the final two.

Before ''Game of Thrones'' both Benioff and Weiss worked in film, and were unfamiliar with working on a television show. This resulted in several first-season episodes being about 10 minutes too short for HBO, forcing them to write another 100 pages of scripts in two weeks. Due to lack of budget the new scenes were designed to be inexpensive to film, such as two actors conversing in one room. Benioff and Weiss noted that some of their favorite scenes from the first season were the results of the dilemma, including one between Robert and Cersei Baratheon discussing their marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;fleming20130628&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140625000825/http://www.deadline.com/2013/06/emmy-q-a-with-game-of-thrones-david-benioff-and-d-b-weiss/ |archivedate=June 25, 2014 |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/06/emmy-q-a-with-game-of-thrones-david-benioff-and-d-b-weiss/ | title=Emmy Q&amp;A With ‘Game Of Thrones’ David Benioff And D.B.

===Filming===

===Music===
{{main article|Game of Thrones: Season 1 (soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack to ''Game of Thrones'' was originally to be composed by [[Stephen Warbeck]]. On February 2, 2011, only ten weeks prior to the show's premiere, it was reported that Warbeck had left the project and [[Ramin Djawadi]] had been commissioned to write the music instead.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title='Game of Thrones' Changes Its Tune, Hires New Composer|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/02/02/game-of-thrones/|accessdate=July 20, 2011|newspaper=[[TV Squad]]|date=February 2, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418122523/http://www.aoltv.com/2011/02/02/game-of-thrones/|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The music supervisor of ''Game of Thrones'' [[Evyen Klean]] first suggested Djawadi to Benioff and Weiss as the replacement for Warbeck, and although Djawadi was reluctant as he had other commitments at that time, they managed to persuade Djawadi to accept the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/evyen-klean-supervisor-neophonic-2016.htm |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/evyen-klean-supervisor-neophonic-2016.htm |title=Interview With Evyen Klean, Top Music Supervisor and Owner of Neophonic |date=February 24, 2016 |first=Dale |last=Kawashima |publisher=Songwriter Universe |accessdate=July 25, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To give the series its own distinctive musical identity, according to Djawadi, the producers asked him not to use musical elements such as flutes or solo vocals that had already been successfully used by other major fantasy productions. He mentioned that a challenge in scoring the series was its reliance on dialogue and its sprawling cast: on several occasions already-scored music had to be omitted so as not to get in the way of dialogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;December 2012 interview&quot; /&gt;

Djawadi said that he was inspired to write the main title music by an early version of the series's computer-animated title sequence. The title music is reprised as a global theme in the rest of the soundtrack, initially infrequently and as part of the theme of individual characters, then in full towards the end of season 1 during particularly important scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;December 2012 interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.filmmusicmedia.com/interviews/composerinterviewramindjawadi-1 |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |title=Composer Interview: Ramin Djawadi|url=http://www.filmmusicmedia.com/interviews/composerinterviewramindjawadi-1|accessdate=January 4, 2013|work=Filmmusicmedia.com|date=December 22, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
