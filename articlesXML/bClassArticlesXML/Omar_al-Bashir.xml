'''Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;عمر حسن أحمد البشير&lt;/big&gt;}}; born {{nowrap|1 January}} 1944) is the [[List of Presidents of Sudan|President]] of Sudan and the head of the [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]]. He came to power in 1989 when, as a [[brigadier]] in the [[Sudanese Army]], he led a group of officers in a [[1989 Sudanese coup d'état|military coup]] that ousted the democratically elected government of Prime Minister [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]] after it began negotiations with rebels in the south.&lt;ref name=reuters-factbox&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKL1435274220080714|title=FACTBOX – Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=16 July 2008|date=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, he has been elected three times as President in elections that have been under scrutiny for corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8645661.stm|title=Dream election result for Sudan's President Bashir|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, al-Bashir became the first sitting president to be indicted by the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), for allegedly directing a campaign of mass killing, rape, and pillage against civilians in [[Darfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/genocide/genocide-in-sudan.htm|title=Genocide in Darfur |work=United Human Rights Council|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, the prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], accused al-Bashir of [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crime]]s in [[Darfur]].&lt;ref name=ocampo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/press%20releases%20(2008)|title=ICC Prosecutor presents case against Sudanese President, Hassan Ahmad AL BASHIR, for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur|accessdate=14 March 2009|author=International Criminal Court |authorlink=International Criminal Court|date=14 July 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090825232557/http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/press%20releases%20(2008)/a|archivedate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court issued an [[arrest warrant]] for al-Bashir on {{Nowrap|4 March}} 2009 on counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him for genocide.&lt;ref name=ICC-warrant/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=4 March 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7923102.stm|title=Warrant issued for Sudan's Bashir|accessdate=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 12 July 2010, the Court issued a second warrant containing three separate counts.

A leak from [[WikiLeaks]] allegedly reveals that the Sudanese president had embezzled US$9&amp;nbsp;billion in state funds, but [[Lloyds Bank]] of England &quot;insisted it was not aware of any link with Bashir,&quot; while a Sudanese government spokesman called the claim &quot;ludicrous&quot; and attacked the motives of the prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuneaton-news.co.uk/Home/Bank-denies-WikiLeaks-Sudan-claim-0-114639.xnf?FeedSourceID=11&amp;FeedImageID=23758&amp;BodyFormat=1&amp; |title=Bank denies WikiLeaks' Sudan claim|publisher=Nuneaton-news|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the Guardian, al-Bashir said, referring to ICC Prosecuter Ocampo, &quot;The biggest lie was when he said I have $9bn in one of the British banks, and thank God, the British bank and the [British] finance minister ... denied these allegations.&quot;&lt;ref name=theguardian.com/&gt; The arrest warrant has actively increased public support for al-Bashir in Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?mot126|title=Omer Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir|work=[[Sudan Tribune]]|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early and family life==
Al-Bashir was born in [[Hosh Bannaga]], just north of the capital, [[Khartoum]] to a family of [[Arab]] descent. He belongs to Al-Bedairyya Al-Dahmashyya, a [[Bedouin]] tribe belonging to the larger [[Ja'alin]] coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alrakoba.net/news-action-show-id-98179.htm|title=:-|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Sudanese Arab|Arab]] tribe in middle north of Sudan, in the past a part of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan]]. He received his primary education there, and his family later moved to Khartoum where he completed his secondary education. Al-Bashir is married to his cousin Fatima Khalid. He also has a [[Polygamy#Africa|second wife]] named Widad Babiker Omer, who had a number of children with her first husband Ibrahim Shamsaddin, a member of the [[Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation]] who had died in a helicopter crash. Al-Bashir does not have any children of his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Fred Bridgland]]|title=President Bashir, you are hereby charged...|url= http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/world/President-Bashir-you-are-hereby.4287299.jp|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=14 July 2008|accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Al-Bashir joined the [[Sudan People's Armed Forces|Sudanese Army]] in 1960. Al-Bashir studied at the [[Egyptian Military Academy]] in [[Cairo]] and also graduated from the Sudan Military Academy in Khartoum in 1966.&lt;ref name=BBCprofile&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Profile: Sudan's President Bashir|date=25 November 2003|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly rose through the ranks and became a [[paratrooper|paratroop officer]]. Later, al-Bashir served in the [[Egyptian Army]] during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bashir, Omar Hassan Ahmad al- |url=http://au.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_1481578049/Bashir_Omar_Hassan_Ahmad_al-.html |work=[[Encarta|Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia]] 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kx01gxXh?url=http%3A%2F%2Fau.encarta.msn.com%2Fencyclopedia_1481578049%2FBashir_Omar_Hassan_Ahmad_al-.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, al-Bashir was sent to the United Arab Emirates as the Sudanese [[military attaché]]. After his return home al-Bashir was made a garrison commander. In 1981, al-Bashir returned to his paratroop background when he became the commander of an armoured parachute brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/03/20093485834634368|title=Profile: Omar al-Bashir|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency==

===Coup d'état===
{{main|1989 Sudanese coup d'état}}
When he returned to Sudan as a colonel in the [[Military of Sudan|Sudanese Army]], al-Bashir led a group of army officers in ousting the unstable coalition government of Prime Minister [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]] in a bloodless [[coup d'état|military coup]] on {{Nowrap|30 June}} 1989.&lt;ref name=reuters-factbox/&gt; Under al-Bashir's leadership, the new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bekele|first=Yilma|title=Chickens are coming home to roost!|url=http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2929|work=[[Ethiopian Review]]|date=12 July 2008|accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then became Chairman of the [[Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation]] (a newly established body with legislative and executive powers for what was described as a transitional period), and assumed the posts of [[chief of state]], prime minister, chief of the armed forces, and [[minister of defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowell|first=Alan|title= Military Coup in Sudan Ousts Civilian Regime|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DA103DF932A35754C0A96F948260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 July 1989
|accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to al-Bashir's promotion to the Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, he allied himself with [[Hassan al-Turabi]], the leader of the [[National Islamic Front]], who along with al-Bashir began institutionalizing [[Sharia|Sharia law]] in the northern part of Sudan. Further on, al-Bashir issued purges and executions of people whom he alleged to be coup leaders in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, as well as the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, ''Jihad'' (2002), p.181&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bashir arrives - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|Bashir arrives in the Southern capital [[Juba]], 2011]]
On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir's powers increased when he appointed himself [[List of Presidents of Sudan|President]] of the country, after which he disbanded the [[Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation]] and all other rival political parties. The executive and legislative powers of the council were later given to al-Bashir completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/14/sudan.warcrimes3|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Profile: Omar al-Bashir|first=Peter|last=Walker|date=14 July 2008|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, al-Bashir's administration gave the green light to float a new currency called [[Sudanese Dinar]] to replace the battered old Sudanese Pound that had lost 90 percent of its worth during the turbulent 1980s, the currency was later changed back to Pounds but at a much higher rate. He was later elected president (with a five-year term) in the 1996 national election, where he was the only candidate by law to run for election&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;''New York Times'', {{Nowrap|16 March}} 1996, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hassan al-Turabi]] was elected to a seat in the National Assembly where he served as speaker of the National Assembly &quot;during the 1990s.&quot;&lt;ref name=appendix&gt;The Appendix of the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, al-Bashir and the Presidential Committee put into effect a new constitution, allowing limited political associations in opposition to al-Bashir's [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]] and his supporters to be formed, although these groups failed to gain any significant access to governmental power until the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]] became a subject. On {{Nowrap|12 December}} 1999, al-Bashir sent troops and tanks against parliament and ousted [[Hassan al-Turabi]], the speaker of parliament, in a [[palace coup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stefano Bellucci 2000&quot;&gt;Stefano Bellucci, &quot;Islam and Democracy: The 1999 Palace Coup,&quot; ''Middle East Policy'' 7, no. 3 (June 2000):168&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tensions with the UN and Dr. Amin Mekki Medani
'''

On the evening of 6 December 2014, the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) arrested Dr. Amin Mekki Medani, a renowned human rights activist, former President of the Sudan Human Rights Monitor (SHRM) from his house in Khartoum.

The Observatory and ACJPS strongly denounce the arbitrary arrest and detention of Dr. Medani and considers it as a reprisal to sanction his legitimate human rights activities. On 3 December 2014 Dr. Medani signed the “Sudan Call”, on behalf of civil society organisations. The “Sudan Call” is a Declaration on the “Establishment of a State of Citizenship and Democracy”, under which co-signatories committed to work towards the end of the conflicts raging in different regions of Sudan and towards legal, institutional and economic reforms. The Declaration, which commits signatories to end wars and conflicts as a priority, was co-signed in Addis Ababa by representatives from political and armed opposition parties, including the National Umma Party, the National Consensus Forces and the Sudan Revolutionary Front. Dr. Medani co-signed the Sudan Call on behalf of the Civil Society Initiative.

Dr Medani was arrested shortly after he returned from Addis Ababa. There are serious concerns for the safety of Dr. Medani who is 76 years of age and suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes for which he has prescribed medication. According to the information received, the NISS refused to allow him to take his medications with him when he was arrested.

The Observatory and ACJPS more generally urge the Sudanese authorities to put an end to all acts of harassment and intimidation against human rights defenders and to comply with the relevant international norms and standards, in particular the United Nations (UN) Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1998, and regional and international human rights instruments ratified by Sudan.   This wasn't the first time he was arrested, he was also arrested in the 1980s by the government along with his nephew, leaving his wife alone with his five children.

===Elections===
Al Bashir was elected president (with a five-year term) in the 1996 national election&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; and [[Hassan al-Turabi]] was elected to a seat in the National Assembly where he served as speaker of the National Assembly &quot;during the 1990s.&quot;&lt;ref name=appendix/&gt; In 1998, al-Bashir and the Presidential Committee put into effect a new constitution, allowing limited political associations in opposition to al-Bashir's [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]] and his supporters to be formed.

From 2005 to 2010 there was a transitional government set up under a 2005 peace accord that ended more than two decades of north-south civil war and saw the formation of a power-sharing agreement between Salva Kiir's [[SPLM]] and Al Bashir's [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]] (NCP).&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2010/04/201042612282143933.html|title=Sudan president wins re-election|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=27 April 2010|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first multi-party election, Al Bashir was reelected president in the 2010 Presidential Election;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/202/ |title=IFES Election Guide &amp;#124; Country Profile: Sudan |publisher=Electionguide.org |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Salva Kiir, the leader of the former rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement ([[SPLM]]), won re-election in the presidential poll in what was Sudan's semi-autonomous southern region. These elections were agreed on earlier in the 2005 peace accord that ended more than two decades of north-south civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera.com&quot;/&gt;

Bashir won 68% of the popular vote in the 2010 election. However, the election was marked by corruption, intimidation, and inequality. Western observers, from the EU and the Carter Centre, criticised the polls as &quot;not meeting international standards.&quot; Candidates opposed to the SPLM said they were often detained, or stopped from campaigning. Sudan Democracy First, an umbrella organisation in the north, put forward what it called strong evidence of rigging by President Bashir's National Congress Party. The Sudanese Network for Democracy and Elections (Sunde) spoke of harassment and intimidation in the south, by the security forces of the SPLM.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

Al-Bashir has achieved economic growth in Sudan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gettleman&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/24/world/africa/24sudan.html|work=The New York Times |title=War in Sudan?

Not Where the Oil Wealth Flows|first=Jeffrey|last=Gettleman |date=24 October 2006|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth has not been shared by all. Headline inflation in 2012 approached the threshold of chronic inflation (period average 36%), about 11 percentage points up from the budget projection of 2012 reflecting the combined effects of inflationary financing, the depreciation of the exchange rate, and the continued removal of subsidies, as well as high food and energy prices. This economic downturn prompted cost of living riots that erupted into Arab Spring-style anti-government demonstrations; also it aroused the discontent of the Sudanese Worker's Trade Union Federation (SWTUF), which threatened to hold nationwide strikes in support of higher wages. The continued deterioration in the value of the Sudanese pound (SDG) poses grave downside risks to already soaring inflation. This, coupled with the economic slowdown, presents serious challenges to the implementation of the approved Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/countries/east-africa/sudan/|title=Sudan|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensions with Hassan Al-Turabi===
In the mid-1990s, a feud between al-Bashir and al-Turabi began, mostly due to al-Turabi's links to [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] groups, as well as allowing them to operate out of Sudan, even personally inviting [[Osama bin Laden]] to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Shahzad|title = Bin Laden uses Iraq to plot new attacks|work = Asia Times|accessdate = 2 December 2007|date = 23 February 2002|url = http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/DB23Ag02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States had listed Sudan as a [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|state sponsor of terrorism]] since 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,258413,00.html|title=Families of USS Cole Victims Sue Sudan for $105 Million|work=Fox News|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly due to al-Bashir and Hassan al-Turabi taking complete power in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/DB23Ag02.html|title=Bin Laden uses Iraq to plot new attacks|author=|date=|work=atimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames/8552 The Nation|Unconventional Wisdom Since 1865]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. firms have been barred from doing business in Sudan since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061014/pl_nm/bush_darfur_dc |accessdate=18 January 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]] in [[Khartoum]] was destroyed by a U.S. [[cruise missile]] strike because of its alleged production of [[chemical weapon]]s and links to [[al-Qaeda]]. However the U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research wrote a report in 1999 questioning the attack on the factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate; James Risen reported in the New York Times: &quot;Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State [[Phyllis Oakley]] that the C.I.A.'s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Risen, James (27 October 1999). &quot;To Bomb Sudan Plant, or Not: A Year Later, Debates Rankle&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

After being re-elected President of Sudan with a five-year-term in the [[Sudanese general election, 1996|1996 election]] with 75.7 percent of the votes,&lt;ref name=BBCprofile/&gt; al-Bashir issued the registration of legalised political parties in 1999 after being influenced by al-Turabi. Rival parties such as the [[Liberal Democrats (Sudan)|Liberal Democrats of Sudan]] and the Alliance of the Peoples' Working Forces, headed by former Sudanese President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], were established and were allowed to run for election against al-Bashir's [[National Congress (Sudan)|National Congress Party]], however, they failed to achieve significant support, and al-Bashir was re-elected President, receiving 86.5 percent of the vote in the [[Elections in Sudan|2000 presidential election]]. At the [[Sudanese general election, 2000|legislative elections]] that same year, al-Bashir's National Congress Party won 355 out of 360 seats, with al-Turabi as its chairman. However, after al-Turabi introduced a bill to reduce the president's powers, prompting al-Bashir to dissolve parliament and declare a [[state of emergency]], tensions began to rise between al-Bashir and al-Turabi. Reportedly, al-Turabi was suspended as Chairman of National Congress Party, after he urged a boycott of the President's re-election campaign. Then, a splinter-faction led by al-Turabi, the Popular National Congress Party (PNC) signed an agreement with [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]], which led al-Bashir to believe that they were plotting to overthrow him and the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCprofile&quot;/&gt;

Further on, al-Turabi's influence and that of his party's &quot;'internationalist' and ideological wing&quot; waned &quot;in favor of the 'nationalist' or more pragmatic leaders who focus on trying to recover from Sudan's disastrous [[international isolation]] and economic damage that resulted from ideological adventurism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''The Future of Political Islam'', (2003), p.111&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Sudan worked to appease the United States and other international critics by expelling members of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] and encouraging bin Laden to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The Looming Tower'', (2006), pp.221–3&lt;/ref&gt;

On al-Bashir's orders, al-Turabi was imprisoned based on allegations of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] in 2000 before being released in October 2003.&lt;ref name=Denies&gt;Wasil Ali, [http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article27123 &quot;Sudanese Islamist opposition leader denies link with Darfur rebels&quot;], ''Sudan Tribune'', {{Nowrap|13 May}} 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was again imprisoned &lt;!-- list Nimeiri et al. --&gt; in the Kober (Cooper) prison in Khartoum in March 2004.

===Engagement with the U.S. and western countries===
[[File:Al bashir1.jpg|thumb|Bashir and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State [[Robert Zoellick]], 2005]]
From the early 1990s when Bashir assumed power, his regime was at odds with larger U.S. foreign policy in the region. Sudan backed Iraq in its [[Gulf War|invasion of Kuwait]] and was accused of harboring and providing sanctuary and assistance to Islamic terrorist groups. From the early 1990s, [[Carlos the Jackal]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Abu Nidal]] and other United States' and allies labeled 'terrorist leaders' resided in Khartoum. Sudan's role in the radical Pan-Arab Islamic Conference, spearheaded by [[Hassan al-Turabi]], represented a matter of great concern to the security of American officials and dependents in Khartoum, resulting in several reductions and evacuations of U.S. personnel from Khartoum in the early to mid 1990s.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Sudan's Islamist links with international terrorist organizations represented a special matter of concern for the U.S. Government, leading to Sudan's 1993 designation as a state sponsor of terrorism and a suspension of U.S. Embassy operations in Khartoum in 1996. In late 1994, in an initial effort to reverse his nation's growing image throughout the world as a terrorist-harboring country, Bashir secretly cooperated with French special forces to orchestrate the capture and arrest on Sudanese soil of [[Carlos the Jackal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-21/news/mn-29612_1_carlos-the-jackal| title=Carlos the Jackal Reportedly Arrested During Liposuction| work=Los Angeles Times| date=21 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bashir letter to Hamilton.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Sudan's offer of and request for counter-terrorism assistance, April 1997]]
In early 1996, Bashir authorized his Defense Minister at the time, El Fatih Erwa, to make a series of secret trips to the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/sudanmemotext_100301.html|title=1996 CIA Memo to Sudanese Official|work=The Washington Post|date=3 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hold talks with US officials, including officers of the [[CIA]] and [[United States Department of State]] about US sanctions policy against Sudan and what measures might be taken by the Bashir regime to remove the sanctions. Erwa was presented with a series of demands from the United States, including demands for information about [[Osama bin Laden]] and other radical Islamic groups. The US demand list also encouraged Bashir's regime to move away from activities, such as hosting the &quot;PAIC&quot; Islamic Conference, that impinged on Sudanese efforts to reconcile with the West. Sudan's Mukhabarat (central intelligence agency) spent half a decade amassing intelligence data on bin Laden and a wide array of Islamists through their periodic annual visits for the PAIC conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2002/01/osama200201|title=The Osama Files|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1996, after the series of Erwa secret meetings on US soil, the Clinton Administration demanded that Sudan expel bin Laden. Bashir complied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a051896sudan|title=Sudan Expels Bin Laden|publisher=[[History Commons]]|date=18 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy erupted about whether Sudan had offered to extradite bin Laden in return for rescinding US sanctions that were interfering with Sudan's plans to develop oil fields in southern areas of the country. US officials insisted the secret meetings were agreed only to pressure Sudan into compliance on a range of anti-terrorism issues. The Sudanese insisted that an offer to extradite bin Laden had been made in a secret one-on-one meeting at a Fairfax hotel between Erwa and the then [[CIA]] Africa Bureau chief on condition that Washington end sanctions against Bashir's regime. Amb. [[Timothy M. Carney]] attended one of the Fairfax hotel meetings. In a joint opinion piece in the Washington Post Outlook Section in 2003, Carney and Ijaz argued that in fact the Sudanese had offered to extradite bin Laden to a third country in exchange for sanctions relief&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64828-2002Jun29|title=Intelligence Failure? Let's Go Back to Sudan|last=Carney |first=Timothy|author2=[[Mansoor Ijaz]] |date=30 June 2002|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1996, American hedge-fund manager [[Mansoor Ijaz]] traveled to the Sudan and met with senior officials including Turabi and Bashir. Ijaz asked Sudanese officials to share intelligence data with US officials on bin Laden and other Islamists who had traveled to and from the Sudan during the previous five years. Ijaz conveyed his findings to US officials upon his return, including [[Sandy Berger]], then Clinton's deputy national security adviser, and argued for the US to constructively engage the Sudanese and other Islamic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=
http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-718226.html|title=Democratic Fundraiser Pursues Agenda on Sudan|work=The Washington Post|date=29 April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1997, Ijaz persuaded Bashir to make an unconditional offer of counterterrorism assistance in the form of a signed presidential letter that Ijaz delivered to Congressman [[Lee H. Hamilton]] by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/30/local/me-27946|title=Olive Branch Ignored|first=
Mansoor|last=Ijaz|work=Los Angeles Times|date=30 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1997, months after the Sudanese overture (made by Bashir in the letter to Hamilton), the U.S. State Department, under Sec. of State Madeleine Albright's directive, first announced it would return US diplomats to Khartoum to pursue counterterrorism data in the Mukhabarat's possession, and then within days, reversed that decision and imposed harsher and more comprehensive economic, trade, and financial sanctions against the Sudan. In August 1998, in the wake of the East Africa embassy bombings, the U.S. launched [[Operation Infinite Reach|cruise missile strikes]] against Khartoum. The last U.S. Ambassador to the Sudan, Ambassador [[Timothy M. Carney|Tim Carney]], departed post prior to this event and no new ambassador has been designated since. The U.S. Embassy is headed by a [[charge d'affaires]].

Bashir announced in August 2015 that he would travel to New York in September to speak at the United Nations. It is unclear to date if Bashir will be allowed to travel, due to previous sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ewn.co.za/2015/08/04/Omar-alBashir-to-speak-at-UN-Summit-in-New-York | title=Omar al-Bashir to speak at UN Summit in New York | work=Eyewitness News | accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil war had raged between the northern and southern halves of the country for over 19 years between the northern [[Arab]] tribes and southern African tribes, but the war soon effectively developed into a struggle between the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] and al-Bashir's government. The war resulted in millions of southerners being displaced, starved, and deprived of education and health care, with almost two million casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The U.S. Committee for Refugees Crisis in Sudan|url=http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/sudan.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210024759/http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/sudan.htm|archivedate=10 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these actions, various international sanctions were placed on Sudan. International pressure intensified in 2001, however, and leaders from the United Nations called for al-Bashir to make efforts to end the conflict and allow humanitarian and international workers to deliver relief to the southern regions of Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morrison|first=J.

===War in Darfur===
{{main|War in Darfur}}
[[File:Darfur report - Page 4 Image 2.jpg|thumb|140px|Series of [[Water conflict|droughts in Darfur]] led to disputes over land between non-Arab sedentary farmers and Arab [[Janjaweed]] nomads.]] 
Since 1968, Sudanese politicians had attempted to create separate factions of &quot;Africans&quot; and &quot;Arabs&quot; in the western area of [[Darfur]], a difficult task as the population were substantially intermarried and could not be distinguished by skin tone. This internal political instability was aggravated by cross-border conflicts with Chad and Libya&lt;ref&gt;Prunier,G., ''The Ambiguous Genocide'', Ithaca, NY, 2005, pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1984–85 Darfur famine&lt;ref&gt;Prunier, pp. 47–52&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the rebel [[Justice and Equality Movement]] and the [[Sudanese Liberation Army]], accusing the government of neglecting Darfur and oppressing non-Arabs in favor of Arabs, began an armed insurgency.

Estimates vary of the number of deaths resulting from attacks on the non-Arab/Arabized population by the [[Janjaweed]] militia: the Sudanese government claim that up to 10,000 have been killed in this conflict; the United Nations reported that about 300,000 had died as of 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;conflict1&quot;/&gt; and other reports place the figures at between 200,000 and 400,000.&lt;ref name=disputed/&gt; During an interview with [[David Frost]] for the [[Al Jazeera English]] programme [[Frost Over The World]] in June 2008, al-Bashir insisted that no more than 10,000 had died in Darfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/frostovertheworld/2008/06/200862384837263451.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|title=Frost Over the World – Darfur special|date=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, the [[African Union – United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur]] accused Sudan's government of taking part in &quot;gross violations&quot; in Darfur and called for urgent international action to protect civilians there. After fighting stopped in July and August, on {{Nowrap|31 August}} 2006, the [[United Nations Security Council]] approved [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706|Resolution 1706]] which called for a new 20,600-troop UN [[peacekeeping]] force called [[African Union - United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur|UNAMID]] to supplant or supplement a poorly funded and ill-equipped 7,000-troop [[African Union]] [[African Union Mission in Sudan|Mission in Sudan peacekeeping force]].

In 2009, General [[Martin Luther Agwai]], head of the joint African Union – United Nations Operation, said the war was over in the region, although low-level disputes remained. &quot;Banditry, localised issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level. But real war as such, I think we are over that,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8224424.stm|title=War in Sudan's Darfur 'is over'|publisher=BBC News|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is completely contradicted by reports that indicate that violence continues in Darfur while peace efforts have been stalled repeatedly. Violence between Sudan's military and rebel fighters has beset Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states since disputed state elections in May 2011, an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has prompted international condemnation and U.S. congressional hearings. In 2012, tensions between Sudan and South Sudan reached a boiling point when the Sudanese military bombed territory in South Sudan, leading to hostilities over the disputed Heglig (or Panthou) oil fields located along the Sudan-South Sudan border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ndi.org/sudan|title=Sudan – NDI|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Omar al-Bashir sought the assistance of numerous non-western countries after the West, led by America, imposed sanctions against him, he said: &quot;From the first day, our policy was clear: To look eastward, toward China, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and even Korea and Japan, even if the Western influence upon some [of these] countries is strong. We believe that the Chinese expansion was natural because it filled the space left by Western governments, the United States, and international funding agencies. The success of the Sudanese experiment in dealing with China without political conditions or pressures encouraged other African countries to look toward China.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Omar al-Bashir Q&amp;A: 'In Any War, Mistakes Happen on the Ground'|author=Sam Dealey|newspaper=Time|date=14 August 2009|url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1916262-5,00.html|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chadian President Idriss Deby visited Khartoum in 2010 and Chad kicked out the Darfuri rebels it had previously supported. Both Sudanese and Chadian sides together established a joint military border patrol.&lt;ref name=mg&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-02-09-sudan-chad-agree-to-end-proxy-wars|title=Sudan, Chad agree to end proxy wars|work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|date=9 February 2010|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darfur JEM.png|thumb|[[Justice and Equality Movement|JEM]] rebels in Darfur]]
On 26 October 2011, Al Bashir said that Sudan gave military support to the [[Anti-Gaddafi forces|Libyan rebels]], who overthrew [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. In a speech broadcast live on state television, Bashir said the move was in response to Col Gaddafi's support for Sudanese rebels three years ago. Sudan and Libya have had a complicated and frequently antagonistic relationship for many years. President Bashir said the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), a Darfuri rebel group, had attacked Khartoum three years ago using Libyan trucks, equipment, arms, ammunition and money. He said God had given Sudan a chance to respond, by sending arms, ammunition and humanitarian support to the Libyan revolutionaries. &quot;Our God, high and exalted, from above the seven skies, gave us the opportunity to reciprocate the visit,&quot; he said. &quot;The forces which entered Tripoli, part of their arms and capabilities, were 100% Sudanese,&quot; he told the crowd. His speech was well received by a large crowd in the eastern Sudanese town of Kassala. But the easy availability of weapons in Libya, and that country's porous border with Darfur, are also of great concern to the Sudanese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15471734|title=Sudan armed Libyan rebels, says President Bashir|publisher=BBC News|date=26 October 2011|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Bashir in his speech said that his government's priority was to end the armed rebellion and tribal conflicts in order to save blood and direct the energies of young people towards building Sudan instead of &quot;killing and destruction&quot;. He called upon youth of the rebel groups to lay down arms and join efforts to build the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article48062|title=Bashir vows to end rebellion and tribal clashes before 2015 elections|work=[[Sudan Tribune]]|date= 28 March 2009|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Bashir sees himself as a man wronged and misunderstood. He takes full responsibility for the conflict in Darfur, he says, but says that his government did not start the fighting and has done everything in its power to end it.&lt;ref name=theguardian.com/&gt;

Al Bashir has signed two peace agreements for Darfur: 
*The 2006 [[Darfur Peace Agreement]], also known as the &quot;Abuja Agreement&quot;, was signed on 5 May 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations|title=UNAMID Background|url=http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unamid/background.shtml|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the government of Sudan along with a faction of the [[Sudan Liberation Movement/Army|SLA]] led by [[Minni Minnawi]]. However, the agreement was rejected by two other, smaller groups, the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) and a rival faction of the SLA led by [[Abdul Wahid al Nur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Conflict Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]|title=Peace Agreements, Sudan, Darfur Peace Agreement|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=145&amp;regionSelect=1-Northern_Africa#|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Main Rebel Group Sign&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/05/AR2006050500305.html|title=Sudan, Main Rebel Group Sign Peace Deal|author=Kessler, Glenn and Emily Wax|date=5 May 2006|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2011 Darfur Peace Agreement, also known as the &quot;[[2011 Darfur Peace Agreement|Doha Agreement]]&quot;, was signed in July 2011 between the government of Sudan and the [[Liberation and Justice Movement]]. This agreement established a compensation fund for victims of the Darfur conflict, allowed the President of Sudan to appoint a Vice-President from Darfur, and established a new [[Darfur Regional Authority]] to oversee the region until a [[Darfurian referendum, 2012|referendum]] can determine its permanent status within the Republic of Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.sudantribune.com/IMG/pdf/DPA-_Doha_draft.pdf|title=Darfur Peace Document|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=4 February 2014|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The agreement also provided for [[power sharing]] at the national level: movements that sign the agreement will be entitled to nominate two ministers and two four ministers of state at the federal level and will be able to nominate 20 members to the national legislature. The movements will be entitled to nominate two state governors in the Darfur region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiodabanga.org/node/16328|title=Signing of Doha Agreement prompts mixed reactions|publisher=[[Radio Dabanga]]|date=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indictment by the ICC===
[[File:Darfur report - Page 2 Image 1.jpg|thumb|right|Al-Bashir is accused of directing attacks against civilians in [[Darfur]].]]

On 14 July 2008, the Chief Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]], alleged that al-Bashir bore [[command responsibility|individual criminal responsibility]] for [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[war crime]]s committed since 2003 in Darfur.&lt;ref name=ocampo/&gt; The prosecutor accused al-Bashir of having &quot;masterminded and implemented&quot; a plan to destroy the three main ethnic groups—[[Fur people|Fur]], [[Masalit people|Masalit]], and [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]]—with a campaign of murder, rape, and [[deportation]]. The arrest warrant is supported by [[NATO]], the [[Genocide Intervention Network]], and [[Amnesty International]].

An arrest warrant for al-Bashir was issued on {{Nowrap|4 March}} 2009 by a Pre-Trial chamber composed of judges [[Akua Kuenyehia]] of Ghana, [[Anita Usacka]] of Latvia, and [[Sylvia Steiner]] of Brazil&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|hPG0B2JxDdc|(Official Channel of the ICC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicting him on five counts of crimes against humanity (murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape) and two counts of war crimes ([[War loot|pillaging]] and intentionally directing attacks against civilians).&lt;ref name=ICC-warrant&gt;International Criminal Court ({{Nowrap|4 March}} 2009). {{cite web|url= http://www2.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc639078.pdf |title=Warrant of Arrest for Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(358&amp;nbsp;KB)}}.

[[International Criminal Court]] Prosecutor [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]] told U.S. State Department officials on 20 March 2009 that President Bashir 'needed to be isolated.' Ocampo suggested that if Bashir's stash of money were disclosed (he put the figure at possibly $9&amp;nbsp;billion), it would change Sudanese public opinion from him being a &quot;crusader&quot; to that of a [[thief]].&lt;ref&gt;Wikileaks, 09USUNNEWYORK306&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudan is not a state party to the [[Rome Statute]] establishing the ICC, and thus claims that it does not have to execute the warrant. However, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1593]] (2005) referred Sudan to the ICC, which gives the Court [[jurisdiction]] over international crimes committed in Sudan and obligates the State to cooperate with the ICC,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Amnesty International]] – Document – Sudan: Amnesty International calls for arrest of President Al Bashir. {{Nowrap|4 March}} 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore the Court, Amnesty International and others insist that Sudan must comply with the arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=27 July 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7527376.stm|title=Sudan ICC charges concern Mbeki|accessdate=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] stated that al-Bashir must turn himself in to face the charges, and that the Sudanese authorities must detain him and turn him over to the ICC if he refuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-sudanese-president-al-bashir-20090304|title=Everything you need to know about human rights. - Amnesty International|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Bashir has since visited China, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Qatar and several other countries. which refused to arrest him and surrender him to the ICC upon arrival. ICC member state Chad also refused to arrest al-Bashir during a state visit in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/22/chad-refuses-arrest-omar-al-bashir|location=London|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Xan|last=Rice|title=Chad refuses to arrest Omar al-Bashir on genocide charges|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luis Moreno Ocampo and Amnesty International claimed that al-Bashir's plane could be intercepted in International Airspace. Sudan announced that the presidential plane would always be escorted by fighter jets of the [[Sudanese Air Force]] to prevent his arrest. In March 2009, just before Bashir's visit to Qatar, the Sudanese government was reportedly considering sending fighter jets to accompany his plane to Qatar, possibly in response to France expressing support for an operation to intercept his plane in international airspace, as France has military bases in Djibouti and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ethiopianreview.us/9071|author=[[Elias Kifle]]|title=Fighter jets may guard al-Bashir's flight to Qatar|work=Ethiopian Review|date=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges against al-Bashir have been criticised and ignored by interests in Sudan and abroad, particularly in Africa and the Muslim world. Former president of Libya and former Chairman of the [[African Union]] [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] characterized the indictment as a form of terrorism. He also believed that the warrant is an attempt &quot;by (the west) to recolonise their former colonies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7970892.stm|title=Sudan leader in Qatar for summit|publisher=BBC News|date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt said, it was &quot;greatly disturbed&quot; by the ICC decision and called for an emergency meeting of the UN security council to defer the arrest warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/04/sudan-demostrators-support-bashir|title=Uproar in Sudan over Bashir war crimes warrant|work=The Guardian|date= 4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arab League]] Secretary-General [[Amr Moussa]] expressed that the organization emphasizes its solidarity with Sudan.

During a visit to Egypt, al-Bashir was not arrested, leading to condemnation by [[Amnesty International]]. In October 2009, al-Bashir was invited to Uganda by President [[Yoweri Museveni]] for an African Union meeting in [[Kampala]], but did not attend after protest by several NGOs.

A second arrest warrant for President al-Bashir was later issued on 12 July 2010. The ICC issued an additional warrant adding 3 counts of genocide for the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribes.&lt;ref name=BashirWatch&gt;{{cite web|title=BashirWatch|url=http://bashirwatch.org/|publisher=[[United to End Genocide]]|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new warrant included the Court's conclusion that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that (Omar al-Bashir) acted with specific intent to destroy in part the Fur, Masalit and [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] ethnic groups in the troubled Darfur region.&lt;ref&gt;[[RTTNews]] [http://www.rttnews.com/Content/MarketSensitiveNews.aspx?Id=1356662&amp;SM=1] {{Nowrap|12 July}} 2010, accessed {{Nowrap|12 July}} 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ICC released a further statement saying that al-Bashir's charges now include &quot;genocide by killing, genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm and genocide by deliberately inflicting on each target group conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction&quot; in three separate counts. The new warrant will act as a supplement to the first, whereby the charges initially brought against al-Bashir will all remain in place, but will now include the crime of genocide which was ruled out initially, pending appeal.

On 28 August 2010 in [[Nairobi]], the authorities in Kenya chose not to arrest Al-Bashir on International Criminal Court (ICC) charges of genocide when he arrived for a ceremony for the new [[Constitution of Kenya|Kenyan constitution]]. Al-Bashir was escorted into Nairobi's [[Uhuru Park]], where the signing ceremony was taking place, by Tourism minister [[Najib Balala]]. On 28 November 2011, Kenya's High Court Judge Nicholas Ombija ordered the Minister of Internal Security to arrest al-Bashir, &quot;should he set foot in Kenya in the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/28/us-kenya-bashir-icc-idUSTRE7AR0YA20111128|agency=[[Reuters]]|title=Kenyan court issues arrest order for Sudan's Bashir|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Chad and Djibouti continue to allow Bashir to travel freely into their country despite being parties to the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BashirWatch&quot;/&gt;

Al Bashir said that Sudan is not a party to the ICC treaty and could not be expected to abide by its provisions just like the United States, China and Russia. He said &quot;It is a political issue and double standards, because there are obvious crimes like Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan, but [they] did not find their way to the international criminal court&quot;. He added &quot;The same decision in which [the] Darfur case [was] being transferred to the court stated that the American soldiers [in Iraq and Afghanistan] would not be questioned by the court, so it is not about justice, it is a political issue.&quot; Al Bashir accused Luis Moreno Ocampo, the ICC's chief prosecutor since 2003, of repeatedly lying in order to damage his reputation and standing. Al Bashir said &quot;The behaviour of the prosecutor of the court, it was clearly the behaviour of a political activist not a legal professional. He is now working on a big campaign to add more lies.&quot; He added &quot;The biggest lie was when he said I have $9bn in one of the British banks, and thank God, the British bank and the [British] finance minister … denied these allegations.&quot; He also said: &quot;The clearest cases in the world such as Palestine and Iraq and Afghanistan, clear crimes to the whole humanity – all were not transferred to the court.&quot;&lt;ref name=theguardian.com/&gt;

In October 2013, several members of the African Union expressed anger at the ICC, calling it &quot;racist&quot; for failing to file charges against Western leaders or Western allies while prosecuting only African suspects so far. The African Union demanded that the ICC protect African heads of state from prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Geoffrey York|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/african-union-demands-icc-to-protect-leaders-from-prosecution/article14850866/|title=African Union demands ICC exempt leaders from prosecution|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=13 October 2013|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, while in South Africa for an [[African Union]] meeting, Al Bashir was prohibited from leaving that country while a court decided whether he should be handed over to the ICC for war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-06-14-sa-court-to-rule-on-sudan-presidents-fate|title=SA court to rule on Sudan president's fate|date=14 June 2015|access-date=14 June 2015|website=Mail &amp; Guardian|first=Mmanaledi|last=Mataboge}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, nevertheless, was allowed to leave South Africa soon afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://m.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/Laughter-as-court-told-al-Bashir-has-left-20150615|title=Laughter as court told Al-Bashir has left|date=15 June 2015|access-date=15 June 2015|website=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015 he traveled to India to attend the India-Africa Summit and there were calls for his arrest by Amnesty International but since India is not a signatory of the Rome statute the ICC does not have jurisdiction in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=India-Africa summit: Arrest Sudan President Omar al-Bashir, demands Amnesty International|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/india-africa-summit-arrest-sudan-president-omar-al-bashir-demands-amnesty-international/#sthash.3TKYElzZ.dpuf|journal=The Indian Express|location= New Delhi|publisher=The Indian Express|date=26 October 2015 |access-date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview, while in India, he stated that nothing could prevent him from going to South Africa again in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Al-Bashir |first=Omar |subjectlink=Omar Al-Bashir |interviewer=Vickram Bahl|title=The Front Page Interview | url=http://www.itmn.tv |work=Vickram Bahl interview |publisher=ITMN Tv |location=New Delhi |date=3 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military intervention in Yemen===

In 2015, Sudan participated in the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Shia]] [[Houthis]] and forces loyal to former President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-27/sudan-joining-saudi-campaign-in-yemen-shows-shift-in-region-ties Sudan Joining Saudi Campaign in Yemen Shows Shift in Region Ties]&quot;.

[[CNN]]. 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Reuters reported, &quot;The war in Yemen has given Omar Hassan al-Bashir, a skilled political operator who has ruled Sudan for a quarter-century, an opportunity to show wealthy Sunni powers that he can be an asset against Iranian influence – if the price is right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/04/30/uk-sudan-yemen-idUKKBN0NL0K720150430 Sudan maintains balancing act with Saudi, Iran]&quot;. [[Reuters]]. 30 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of corruption===
Al-Bashir's long career has been riddled with war. Despite his pledge to end the 21-year civil war that had been carrying on when he took office in 1989, further conflict continued after that he prolonged. During the frequent fighting, Al-Bashir allegedly looted the impoverished nation of much of its wealth. According to leaked US diplomatic cables, $9&amp;nbsp;billion of his siphoned wealth was stashed in London banks. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the chief prosecutor, stated that some of the funds were being held in the part-nationalize Lloyds Banking Group. He also reportedly told US officials it was necessary to go public with the scale of Al-Bashir's extortion to turn public opinion against him.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web| title =Profile: Sudan's Omar al-Bashir| publisher =BBC| date =5 December 2011| url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16010445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Ocampo suggested if Bashir's stash of money were disclosed (he put the figure at $9bn), it would change Sudanese public opinion from him being a 'crusader' to that of a thief,&quot; one US official stated. &quot;Ocampo reported Lloyds bank in London may be holding or knowledgeable of the whereabouts of his money,&quot; the report says. &quot;Ocampo suggested exposing Bashir had illegal accounts would be enough to turn the Sudanese against him.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Hirsch| first =Afua| title =WikiLeaks cables: Sudanese president 'stashed $9bn in UK banks| work =The Guardian| date =17 December 2010| url =http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/17/wikileaks-sudanese-president-cash-london}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darfur has been rife with conflict since 2003, when rebels took up arms against the Sudanese government, accusing it of discriminating and neglecting the needs of the region, as well as extorting of state funds. The government is accused of retaliating with ethnic Arab forces on the area, which the government ardently denies. The U.N. estimates 300,000 people have been killed and roughly 2.7 million have been displaced in the war. Union peacekeepers began occupying Darfur in 2005 and were later reinforced by additional UN troops in 2007. The peacekeeping force has been frequently attacked although violence as a whole has declined. The occupying force has limited Al-Bashir's ability to extort funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Even dictators have to quit sometimes… Sudanese military general accused of war crimes stands down to make way for new blood| work =Daily Mail| date =22 March 2013| url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2297548/Sudans-president-Omar-al-Bashir-accused-war-crimes-stand-down.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===African space agency===
In 2012 Bashir proposed setting up a continent wide space agency in Africa. In a statement he said; &quot;I'm calling for the biggest project, an African space agency. Africa must have its space agency. It will liberate Africa from technological domination&quot;. This followed previous calls in 2010 by the African Union (AU) to conduct a feasibility study that would draw up a &quot;roadmap for the creation of the African space agency&quot;. African astronomy received a massive boost when South Africa was awarded the lion's share of the [[Square Kilometre Array]], the world's biggest radio telescope. It will see dishes erected in nine African countries. But skeptics have questioned whether a continental body in the style of [[NASA]] or the [[European Space Agency]] would be affordable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/sudanese-president-african-space-agency|title=Sudanese president calls for African space agency|author=[[David Smith (journalist)|David Smith]]|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
