The '''bonobo''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|.|ˈ|n|oʊ|.|b|oʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|.|n|ə|.|b|oʊ}}; ''Pan paniscus''), formerly called the '''pygmy chimpanzee''' and less often, the '''dwarf''' or '''gracile chimpanzee''',&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Waal |first1=Frans |last2=Lanting |first2=Frans |year=1997 |title=Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-20535-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Endangered Species|endangered]] [[great ape]] and one of the two [[species]] making up the [[genus]] ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]''; the other is ''Pan troglodytes'', or the [[common chimpanzee]]. Although the name &quot;chimpanzee&quot; is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually understood as referring to the common chimpanzee, whereas ''Pan paniscus'' is usually referred to as the bonobo.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20160910&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Angier |first=Natalie |title=Beware the Bonds of Female Bonobos |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/bonobos-apes-matriarchy.html |date=September 10, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=September 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bonobo is distinguished by relatively long legs, pink lips, dark face and tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted long hair on its head. The bonobo is found in a {{Convert|500000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} area of the [[Congo Basin]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Central Africa. The species is [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] and inhabits [[Old-growth forest|primary]] and [[secondary forest]]s, including seasonally inundated [[swamp forest]]s. Political instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos has meant there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat.

Along with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to [[human]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20160910&quot; /&gt; Because the two species are not proficient swimmers, the formation of the [[Congo River]] 1.5–2 million years ago possibly led to the [[speciation]] of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There is no concrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] and is threatened by [[habitat destruction]] and human population growth and movement, though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat. They typically live 40 years in captivity;&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, N. (1996) ''Pictural Guide to the Living Primates'', Pogonias Press, East Hampton, ISBN 0-9648825-1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; their lifespan in the wild is unknown. As of June 2016 a total of 119 live in zoos across Europe; 65 distributed between six different German zoos, and a further 54 in zoos in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and England.

== Etymology ==
Despite the alternative common name &quot;pygmy chimpanzee&quot;, the bonobo is not especially diminutive when compared to the common chimpanzee. &quot;Pygmy&quot; may instead refer to the [[pygmy peoples]] who live in the same area.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot; /&gt; The name &quot;bonobo&quot; first appeared in 1954, when [[Eduard Paul Tratz]] and [[Heinz Heck]] proposed it as a new and separate generic term for pygmy chimpanzees. The name is thought to be a misspelling on a shipping crate from the town of [[Bolobo]] on the [[Congo River]], which was associated with the collection of chimps in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage-Rumbaugh1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Savage-Rumbaugh |first1=Sue |last2=Lewin |first2=Roger |year=1994 |title=Kanzi: the ape at the brink of the human mind |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-385-40332-1 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=de Waal |first=Frans |year=2005 |title=Our Inner Ape |publisher=[[Riverhead Books]] |isbn=1-57322-312-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been reported as being a word for &quot;ancestor&quot; in an extinct [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal2005&quot; /&gt;

== Evolutionary history ==
=== Fossils ===
Fossils of ''Pan'' species were not described until 2005. Existing chimpanzee populations in West and Central Africa do not overlap with the major human fossil sites in East Africa. However, ''Pan'' fossils have now been reported from [[Kenya]]. This would indicate that both humans and members of the ''Pan'' [[clade]] were present in the East African [[East African Rift|Rift Valley]] during the Middle [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McBrearty2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBrearty |first1=Sally |last2=Jablonski |first2=Nina G. |date=1 September 2005 |title=First fossil chimpanzee |journal=Nature |pmid=16136135 |doi=10.1038/nature04008 |bibcode=2005Natur.437..105M |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=105–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to A. Zihlman, bonobo body proportions closely resemble those of ''[[Australopithecus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zihlman |first1=AL |last2=Cronin |first2=JE |last3=Cramer |first3=DL |last4=Sarich |first4=VM |year=1978 |title=Pygmy chimpanzee as a possible prototype for the common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas |journal=Nature |pmid=703839 |doi=10.1038/275744a0 |bibcode=1978Natur.275..744Z |volume=275 |issue=5682 |pages=744–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading evolutionary biologists like [[Jeremy Griffith]] to suggest that bonobos may be a living example of our distant human ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffith |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Griffith |year=2013 |title=Freedom Book 1 |volume=Part 8:4G |publisher=WTM Publishing &amp; Communications |isbn=978-1-74129-011-0 |url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/freedom-book1-integration-through-love-indoctrination/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomy and phylogeny ===
German anatomist [[Ernst Schwarz]] is credited with being the first Westerner to recognise the bonobo as being distinctive, in 1928, based on his analysis of a [[skull]] in the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa|Tervuren museum]] in Belgium that previously had been thought to have belonged to a juvenile chimpanzee. Schwarz published his findings in 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarz1929&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwarz |first=Ernst |date=April 1, 1929 |title=Das Vorkommen des Schimpansen auf den linken Kongo-Ufer |journal=Revue de zoologie et de botanique africaines |volume=16 |pages=425–426 |url=http://www.metafro.be/primates/English_translation_of_Schwarz.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coolidge1933&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coolidge |first=Harold Jefferson Jr. |date=July–September 1933 |title=''Pan paniscus''.

The first official publication of the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome became publicly available in June 2012. It was deposited with the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) under the EMBL accession number AJFE01000000&lt;ref&gt;Prüfer, Kay ''et al.'' (2012) &quot;The bonobo genome compared with the chimpanzee and human genomes&quot;. ''Nature'' {{DOI|10.1038/nature11128}} PMID 22722832&lt;/ref&gt; after a previous analysis by the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] confirmed that the bonobo genome is about 0.4% divergent from the chimpanzee genome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karow2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Karow |first=Julia |date=2008-05-13 |title=Neandertal, bonobo genomes may shed light on human evolution; MPI, 454 preparing drafts |publisher=Genome Web |work=In Sequence |url=http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/neandertal-bonobo-genomes-may-shed-light-human-evolution-mpi-454-preparing-draft |accessdate=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, {{As of|2011|lc = y}} [[Svante Pääbo]]'s group at the ''[[Max Planck Institute]] for Evolutionary Anthropology'' were sequencing the genome of a female bonobo from the Leipzig zoo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karow2008&quot; /&gt;

Initial genetic studies characterised the [[DNA]] of chimpanzees and bonobos as being 98% to 99.4% identical to that of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BonoboDNA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/aforest/bonobo.html | title = Colombus Zoo: Bonobo | accessdate = 2006-08-01 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060502101116/http://www.colszoo.org/animalareas/aforest/bonobo.html | archivedate = 2006-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies showed that chimpanzees and bonobos are more closely related to humans than to [[gorilla]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takahata1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takahata | first1 = N. | last2 = Satta | first2 = Y. | last3 = Klein | first3 = J. | year = 1995 | title = Divergence time and population size in the lineage leading to modern humans | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–221 | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.1995.1026 | pmid = 7482371}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the crucial ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' paper reporting on initial genome comparisons, researchers identified 35 million [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|single-nucleotide changes]], five million insertion or deletion events, and a number of [[Chromosomal translocation|chromosomal rearrangements]] which constituted the genetic differences between the two ''Pan'' species and humans, covering 98% of the same genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChimpGenome&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | authors = [[The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium]] | date = 1 September 2005 | title = Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue=7055 | pages = 69–87 | doi = 10.1038/nature04072 | pmid=16136131|bibcode = 2005Natur.437...69. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of these analyses have been performed on the common chimpanzee rather than the bonobo, the differences between the two ''Pan'' species are unlikely to be substantial enough to affect the ''Pan''-''Homo'' comparison significantly.

There still is controversy, however. Scientists such as [[Jared Diamond]] in ''[[The Third Chimpanzee]]'', and [[Morris Goodman]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hecht2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hecht | first = Jeff | title = Chimps are human, gene study implies | journal = [[New Scientist]] | date = 19 May 2003 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3744-chimps-are-human-gene-study-implies.html | accessdate = 2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Wayne State University]] in Detroit suggest that the bonobo and common chimpanzee are so closely related to humans that their [[genus]] name also should be classified with the human genus ''Homo'': ''Homo paniscus'', ''Homo sylvestris'', or ''Homo arboreus''. An alternative philosophy suggests that the term ''Homo sapiens'' is the misnomer  rather, and that humans should be reclassified as ''Pan sapiens'', though this would violate the [[Principle of Priority]], as ''Homo'' was named before ''Pan'' (1758 for the former, 1816 for the latter). In either case, a name change of the genus would have implications on the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of extinct species closely related to humans, including ''[[Australopithecus]]''. The current line between ''Homo'' and non-''Homo'' species is drawn about 2.5 million years ago, and chimpanzee and human ancestry converge only about 7 million years ago, nearly three times longer.

DNA evidence suggests the bonobo and common chimpanzee species effectively separated from each other fewer than one million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Won2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Won | first1 = Yong-Jin | last2 = Hey | first2 = Jody | title = Divergence population genetics of chimpanzees | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | journal = Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution | pages = 297–307 | date = 13 October 2004 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msi017 | pmid = 15483319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fischer2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = Anne | first2 = Victor | last2 = Wiebe | first3 = Svante | last3 = Pääbo | first4 = Molly | last4 = Przeworski | title = Evidence for a complex demographic history of chimpanzees | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | journal = Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution | pages = 799–808 | date = 12 February 2004 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msh083 | pmid = 14963091}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pan'' line split from the [[human evolution|last common ancestor]] shared with humans approximately six to seven million years ago. Because no species other than ''Homo sapiens'' has survived from the human line of that branching, both ''Pan'' species are the closest living relatives of humans and [[cladistics|cladistically]] are equally close to humans. The recent genome data confirms the genetic equidistance.

The bonobo is commonly considered to be more [[Gracility|gracile]] than the common chimpanzee. Although large male chimpanzees can exceed any bonobo in bulk and weight, the two species actually broadly overlap in body size. Adult female bonobos are somewhat smaller than adult males. Body mass in males ranges from {{convert|34|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, against an average of {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in females. The total length of bonobos (from the nose to the rump while on all fours) is {{convert|70|to|83|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Scholz | first1 = M.

(2011) ''Animal Tool Behavior: The Use and Manufacture of Tools by Animals'', JHU Press, ISBN 1421401282.&lt;/ref&gt; The bonobo's head is relatively smaller than that of the common chimpanzee with less prominent brow ridges above the eyes. It has a black face with pink lips, small ears, wide nostrils, and long hair on its head that forms a parting. Females have slightly more prominent breasts, in contrast to the flat breasts of other female apes, although not so prominent as those of humans. The bonobo also has a slim upper body, narrow shoulders, thin neck, and long legs when compared to the common chimpanzee.

Bonobos are both terrestrial and arboreal. Most ground locomotion is characterized by quadrupedal knuckle walking. Bipedal [[walking]] has been recorded as less than 1% of terrestrial locomotion in the wild, a figure that decreased with [[habituation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Comparative locomotor behavior of chimpanzees and bonobos: the influence of morphology on locomotion|volume = 91|issue = 1|journal = Am J Phys Anthropol|pages = 83–98|year = 1993|pmid = 8512056|doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330910106|author1 = Doran|first1 = D. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in captivity there is a wide variation. Bipedal walking in captivity, as a percentage of bipedal plus quadrupedal locomotion bouts, has been observed from 3.9% for spontaneous bouts to nearly 19% when abundant food is provided.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Août2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = K. | last1 = D’Août | first2 = E. | last2 = Vereecke | first3 = K. | last3 = Schoonaert | first4 = D. | last4 = De Clercq | first5 = L. | last5 = Van Elsacker | first6 = P. | last6 = Aerts | title = Locomotion in bonobos (''Pan paniscus''): differences and similarities between bipedal and quadrupedal terrestrial walking, and a comparison with other locomotor modes | journal = Journal of Anatomy | year = 2004 | volume = 204 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–361 | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00292.x | pmc = 1571309 | pmid=15198700}}&lt;/ref&gt; These physical characteristics and its posture give the bonobo an appearance more closely resembling that of humans than that of the common chimpanzee. The bonobo also has highly individuated facial features,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Wiessner, Pauline and Schiefenhövel, Wulf (1996).

===General===
Primatologist [[Frans de Waal]] states bonobos are capable of [[altruism]], [[compassion]], [[empathy]], kindness, patience, and [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]],&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1997&quot;/&gt; and described &quot;bonobo society&quot; as a &quot;[[gynecocracy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = de Waal | first = Frans | title = The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism Among the Primates | publisher = W.

An analysis of female bonding among wild bonobos by Takeshi Furuichi stresses female sexuality and shows how female bonobos spend much more time in [[estrus]] than female chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmid = 22038769| year = 2011| author1 = Furuichi| first1 = T| title = Female contributions to the peaceful nature of bonobo society| journal = Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews| volume = 20| issue = 4| pages = 131–42| doi = 10.1002/evan.20308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some primatologists have argued that de Waal's data reflect only the behavior of captive bonobos, suggesting that wild bonobos show levels of aggression closer to what is found among chimpanzees.

The two species behave quite differently even if kept under identical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/204757| title = The Social Behavior of Chimpanzees and Bonobos: Empirical Evidence and Shifting Assumptions| journal = Current Anthropology| volume = 39| issue = 4| pages = 399–420| year = 1998| last1 = Stanford | first1 = C.

=== Social behavior ===
[[File:6_bonobos_WHCalvin_IMG_1341.JPG|thumb|Bonobos are very social.]]
[[File:BonoboFishing05.jpeg|thumb|Bonobo searching for termites]]
Most studies indicate that females have a higher social status in bonobo society.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20160910&quot; /&gt; Aggressive encounters between males and females are rare, and males are tolerant of infants and juveniles. A male derives his status from the status of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;White F. (1996) &quot;Comparative socio-ecology of ''Pan paniscus''&quot;, pp. 29–41 in: McGrew WC, Marchant LF, Nishida T (eds.) ''Great ape societies''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univ Press, ISBN 0521555361.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother–son bond often stays strong and continues throughout life. While social hierarchies do exist, and although the son of a high ranking female may outrank a lower female, rank plays a less prominent role than in other primate societies.&lt;ref&gt; Henry Nicholls. 17 March 2016. [http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160317-do-bonobos-really-spend-all-their-time-having-sex Do bonobos really spend all their time having sex?]. ''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the promiscuous mating behavior of female bonobos, a male cannot be sure which offspring are his. As a result, the entirety of parental care in bonobos is assumed by the mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Cawthon Lang KA. (December 2010) [http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/bonobo/behav Primate Factsheets: Bonobo (''Pan paniscus'') behavior]. University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonobo [[Group size measures|party size]] tends to vary because the groups exhibit a [[Fission-fusion society|fission–fusion pattern]]. A community of approximately 100 will split into small groups during the day while looking for food, and then will come back together to sleep. They sleep in nests that they construct in trees.

=== Sociosexual behaviour ===
{{see also|Animal sexual behaviour#Genital-genital rubbing|Homosexual behavior in animals#Bonobo and other apes}}
[[File:Bonobo sexual behavior 1.jpg|thumb|Bonobos mating, [[Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens]].]]
Sexual activity generally plays a major role in bonobo society, being used as what some scientists perceive as a [[greeting]], a means of forming social bonds, a means of [[conflict resolution]], and [[reconciliation (democratic process)#In animals|postconflict reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubpages.unh.edu/~jel/512/aggression-01.html Aggression topics].

Bonobos do not form [[monogamy|permanent monogamous sexual relationships]] with individual partners. They also do not seem to discriminate in their sexual behavior by sex or age, with the possible exception of abstaining from sexual activity between mothers and their adult sons. When bonobos come upon a new food source or feeding ground, the increased excitement will usually lead to communal sexual activity, presumably decreasing tension and encouraging peaceful feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Bonobo Sex and Society | last = de Waal | first = Frans B.

This sexual activity happens within the immediate female bonobo community and sometimes outside of it. [[Ethology|Ethologist]] [[Jonathan Balcombe]] stated that female bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, &quot;which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement&quot;; he added that it is estimated that they engage in this practice &quot;about once every two hours&quot; on average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balcombe 2011&quot; /&gt; Because bonobos occasionally copulate face-to-face, &quot;evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk has suggested that the position of the clitoris in bonobos and some other primates has evolved to maximize stimulation during sexual intercourse&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balcombe 2011&quot; /&gt; On the other hand, the frequency of face-to-face mating observed in zoos and sanctuaries is not reflected in the wild, and thus may be an artifact of captivity. The position of the clitoris may alternatively permit GG-rubbings, which has been hypothesized to function as a means for female bonobos to evaluate their intrasocial relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;hohmannfruth2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Use and function of genital contacts among female bonobos | last1 = Hohmann | first1 = G. | last2 = Fruth | first2 = B. |journal = [[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] | date = 2000 | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–120 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonobo males occasionally engage in various forms of male–male genital behavior,&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1995&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2004/laird/Social%20Organization.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519005633/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2004/laird/Social%20Organization.htm |archivedate=2011-05-19 |title=Courtney Laird, &quot;Social Organization&quot; |publisher=Bio.davidson.edu |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the non-human analogue of [[frot]]ting, engaged in by human males. In one form, two bonobo males hang from a tree limb face-to-face while [[penis fencing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1995&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=penisfencing&gt;{{cite book|author= Frans B.

Another form of genital interaction (rump rubbing) occurs to express reconciliation between two males after a conflict, when they stand back-to-back and rub their scrotal sacs together. [[Takayoshi Kano]] observed similar practices among bonobos in the natural habitat.

More often than the males, female bonobos engage in mutual genital behavior, possibly to bond socially with each other, thus forming a female nucleus of bonobo society. The bonding among females enables them to dominate most of the males. Although male bonobos are individually stronger, they cannot stand alone against a united group of females.&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1995&quot; /&gt; Adolescent females often leave their native community to join another community. This migration mixes the bonobo [[gene pool]]s, providing [[genetic diversity]]. Sexual bonding with other females establishes these new females as members of the group.

Bonobo reproductive rates are no higher than those of the common chimpanzee.&lt;ref name=deWaal1995 /&gt; During [[oestrus]], females undergo [[Sexual swelling|a swelling]] of the [[perineal tissue]] lasting 10 to 20 days. Most matings occur during the maximum swelling.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The gestation period is on average 240 days. [[Postpartum amenorrhea]] (absence of menstruation) lasts less than one year and a female may resume external signs of oestrus within a year of giving birth, though the female is probably not fertile at this point. Female bonobos carry and nurse their young for four years and give birth on average every 4.6 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pan_paniscus.html | last1 = Williams | first1 = A. | first2 = P. | last2 = Myers | year = 2004 | title = ''Pan paniscus'' | publisher = [[Animal Diversity Web]] | accessdate = 6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to common chimpanzees, bonobo females resume the genital swelling cycle much sooner after giving birth, enabling them to rejoin the sexual activities of their society. Also, bonobo females which are sterile or too young to reproduce still engage in sexual activity.

=== Peacefulness ===

Observations in the wild indicate that the males among the related common chimpanzee communities are extraordinarily hostile to males from outside the community.

Between groups, social mingling may occur, in which members of different communities have sex and groom each other, behavior which is unheard of among common chimpanzees. Conflict is still possible between rival groups of bonobos, but no official scientific reports of it exist.

Recent studies show that there are significant brain differences between bonobos and chimps. The brain anatomy of bonobos has more developed and larger regions assumed to be vital for feeling empathy, sensing distress in others and feeling anxiety, which makes them less aggressive and more empathic than their close relatives. They also have a thick connection between the [[amygdala]], an important area that can spark aggression, and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, which helps control impulses. This thicker connection may make them better at regulating their emotional impulses and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/brain-differences-may-explain-varying-behavior-of-bonobos-and-chimpanzees/2011/03/29/AFP2wUND_story.html Brain differences may explain varying behavior of bonobos and chimpanzees].

Bonobo society is dominated by females, and severing the lifelong alliance between mothers and their male offspring may make them vulnerable to female aggression.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20160910&quot; /&gt; De Waal has warned of the danger of romanticizing bonobos: &quot;All animals are competitive by nature and cooperative only under specific circumstances&quot; and that &quot;when first writing about their behaviour, I spoke of 'sex for peace' precisely because bonobos had plenty of conflicts. There would obviously be no need for peacemaking if they lived in perfect harmony.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Waal|first=Frans |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-08-08/ |title=Bonobos, Left &amp; Right|publisher=Skeptic|date=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surbeck and Hohmann showed in 2008 that bonobos sometimes do hunt monkey species. Five incidents were observed in a group of bonobos in [[Salonga National Park]], which seemed to reflect deliberate cooperative hunting. On three occasions, the hunt was successful, and infant monkeys were captured and eaten.&lt;ref name=Surbeck/&gt;

The communication system of wild bonobos includes a characteristic that was earlier only known in humans: bonobos use the same call to mean different things in different situations, and the other bonobos have to take the context into account when determining the meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date = August 4, 2015 | url = http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33731444 | work = [[BBC News]] | title = Bonobo squeaks hint at earlier speech evolution | accessdate = 2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two bonobos at the [[Great Ape Trust]], [[Kanzi]] and [[Panbanisha]], have been taught how to communicate using a keyboard labeled with [[lexigrams]] (geometric symbols) and they can respond to spoken sentences. Kanzi's vocabulary consists of more than 500 English words,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatapetrust.org/bonobo/meet/kanzi.php|title=Meet our Great Apes: Kanzi|accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080630201101/http://www.greatapetrust.org/bonobo/meet/kanzi.php|archivedate = 2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has comprehension of around 3,000 spoken English words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Raffaele, P. |year=2006|title=Speaking Bonobo|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/10022981.html|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanzi is also known for learning by observing people trying to teach his mother; Kanzi started doing the tasks that his mother was taught just by watching, some of which his mother had failed to learn. Some, such as [[philosopher]] and [[bioethics|bioethicist]] [[Peter Singer]], argue that these results qualify them for &quot;[[Right to life|rights to survival and life]]&quot; — rights that humans theoretically accord to all [[person]]s. (See [[great ape personhood]]) Afterwards Kanzi was also taught how to use and create stone tools in 1990. Then, within 3 years, three researchers — Kathy Schick, Nicholas Toth and Gary Garufi — wanted to test Kanzi's knapping skills. Though Kanzi was able to form flake technology, he did not create it the way they expected. Unlike the way hominids did it, where they held the core in one hand and knapped it with the other, Kanzi threw the cobble against a hard surface or against another cobble. This allowed him to produce a larger force to initiate a fracture as opposed to knapping it in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schick|first1=Kathy|last2=Toth|first2=Nicholas|last3=Garufi|first3=Gary|last4=Savage-Rumbaugh|first4=E.Sue|last5=Rumbaugh|first5=Duane|last6=Sevcik|first6=Rose|title=Continuing Investigations into the Stone Tool-making and Tool-using Capabilities of a Bonobo (''Pan paniscus'')|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=26|issue=7|pages=821–832|date=1999|doi=10.1006/jasc.1998.0350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other great apes and humans, third party affiliation toward the victim – the affinitive contact made toward the recipient of an aggression by a group member other than the aggressor – is present in bonobos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Palagi E| title = Reconciliation and consolation in captive bonobos (''Pan paniscus'') |year= 2004| journal = Am J Primatol| volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages= 15–30| pmid = 14752810 | doi = 10.1002/ajp.20000 | last2 = Paoli | last3 = Tarli }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Palagi E|author2= Norscia I| title = Bonobos Protect and Console Friends and Kin |year= 2013| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages= e79290 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0079290|pmid= 24223924|bibcode= 2013PLoSO...879290P | pmc=3818457}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that both the affiliation spontaneously offered by a bystander to the victim and the affiliation requested by the victim (solicited affiliation) can reduce the probability of further aggression by group members on the victim (this fact supporting the ''Victim-Protection Hypothesis''). Yet, only spontaneous affiliation reduced victim anxiety – measured via self-scratching rates – thus suggesting not only that non-solicited affiliation has a consolatory function but also that the spontaneous gesture – more than the protection itself – works in calming the distressed subject. The authors hypothesize that the victim may perceive the motivational autonomy of the bystander, who does not require an invitation to provide post-conflict affinitive contact. Moreover, spontaneous – but not solicited – third party affiliation was affected by the bond between consoler and victim (this supporting the ''Consolation Hypothesis''). Importantly, spontaneous affiliation followed the empathic gradient described for humans, being mostly offered to kin, then friends, then acquaintances (these categories having been determined using affiliation rates between individuals). Hence, consolation in the bonobo may be an empathy-based phenomenon.

Instances in which non-human primates have expressed joy have been reported. One study analyzed and recorded sounds made by human infants and bonobos when they were tickled.&lt;ref name=discoverylaugh&gt;{{cite web|author=Beale, B. |year=2003|title=Where Did Laughter Come From?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2003/10/07/961420.htm|publisher=ABC Science Online|accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bonobos' laugh was at a higher [[audio frequency|frequency]], the laugh was found to follow a [[spectroscopy|spectrographic]] pattern similar to that of human babies.&lt;ref name=discoverylaugh/&gt;

== Distribution and habitat ==
Bonobos are found only south of the [[Congo River]] and north of the [[Kasai River]] (a tributary of the Congo),&lt;ref name=ancestor&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Ancestor's Tale |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |chapter=Chimpanzees |isbn=1-155-16265-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the humid forests of the [[Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] of central [[Africa]]. Ernst Schwarz's 1927 paper “''Le Chimpanzé de la Rive Gauche du Congo''”, announcing his discovery, has been read as an association between the Parisian [[Left Bank (Paris)|Left Bank]] and the left bank of the Congo River; the bohemian culture in Paris, and an unconventional ape in the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quammen|first=David|title=The Left Bank Ape|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/bonobos/quammen-text|work=The New Age of Exploration, 2013|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation status ==
The [[IUCN Red List]] classifies bonobos as an [[endangered species]], with conservative population estimates ranging from 29,500 to 50,000 individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot; /&gt; Major threats to bonobo populations include [[habitat loss]] and hunting for [[bushmeat]], the latter activity having increased dramatically during the [[First Congo War|first]] and [[Second Congo War|second Congo wars]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] due to the presence of heavily armed militias even in remote &quot;protected&quot; areas such as [[Salonga National Park]]. This is part of a more general trend of ape extinction.

As the bonobos' habitat is shared with people, the ultimate success of conservation efforts will rely on local and community involvement. The issue of parks versus people&lt;ref&gt;Reid, John (2006-06-15). [http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Parks-and-people-not-parks-vs-people-2533132.php ''Parks and people, not parks vs. people''], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt; is salient in the [[Cuvette Centrale]] the bonobos' range. There is strong local and broad-based Congolese resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities have often been driven from their forest homes by the establishment of parks. In Salonga National Park, the only national park in the bonobo habitat, there is no local involvement, and surveys undertaken since 2000 indicate the bonobo, the [[African forest elephant]], and other species have been severely devastated by [[Poaching|poachers]] and the thriving bushmeat trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/Survey.php Bonobo and large mammal survey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506233748/http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/Survey.php |date=May 6, 2012 }}. Zoological Society of Milwaukee.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, areas exist where the bonobo and biodiversity still thrive without any established parks, due to the indigenous beliefs and taboos against killing bonobos.

During the wars in the 1990s, researchers and international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) were driven out of the bonobo habitat. In 2002, the [[Bonobo Conservation Initiative]] initiated the Bonobo Peace Forest Project supported by the Global Conservation Fund of [[Conservation International]] and in cooperation with national institutions, local NGOs, and local communities. The Peace Forest Project works with local communities to establish a linked constellation of community-based reserves, managed by local and indigenous people. This model, implemented mainly through DRC organizations and local communities, has helped bring about agreements to protect over {{convert|50,000|sqmi|km2}} of the bonobo habitat. According to Dr. Amy Parish, the Bonobo Peace Forest &quot;is going to be a model for conservation in the 21st century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loe.org/shows/shows.htm?programID=06-P13-00027#feature2 The Make Love, Not War Species], ''Living on Earth'', (July 2006), National Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

The port town of [[Basankusu]] is situated on the [[Lulonga River]], at the confluence of the [[Lopori River|Lopori]] and [[Maringa River|Maringa]] Rivers, in the north of the country, making it well placed to receive and transport local goods to the cities of [[Mbandaka]] and [[Kinshasa]].

In 1995, concern over declining numbers of bonobos in the wild led the Zoological Society of Milwaukee, in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], with contributions from bonobo scientists around the world, to publish the Action Plan for ''Pan paniscus'': A Report on Free Ranging Populations and Proposals for their Preservation. The Action Plan compiles population data on bonobos from 20 years of research conducted at various sites throughout the bonobo's range. The plan identifies priority actions for bonobo conservation and serves as a reference for developing conservation programs for researchers, government officials, and donor agencies.

Acting on Action Plan recommendations, the ZSM developed the Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative. This program includes habitat and rain-forest preservation, training for Congolese nationals and conservation institutions, wildlife population assessment and monitoring, and education. The Zoological Society has conducted regional surveys within the range of the bonobo in conjunction with training Congolese researchers in survey methodology and biodiversity monitoring. The Zoological Society’s initial goal was to survey Salonga National Park to determine the conservation status of the bonobo within the park and to provide financial and technical assistance to strengthen park protection. As the project has developed, the Zoological Society has become more involved in helping the Congolese living in bonobo habitat. The Zoological Society has built schools, hired teachers, provided some medicines, and started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zoosociety.org/conservation/Bonobo/BCBI/ | title = Bonobo and Congo Biodiversity Initiative | publisher = Zoological Society of Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With grants from the United Nations, USAID, the U.S. Embassy, the World Wildlife Fund, and many other groups and individuals, the Zoological Society also has been working to:
*Survey the bonobo population and its habitat to find ways to help protect these apes
*Develop antipoaching measures to help save apes, forest elephants, and other endangered animals in Congo's Salonga National Park, a UN World Heritage site
*Provide training, literacy education, agricultural techniques, schools, equipment, and jobs for Congolese living near bonobo habitats so that they will have a vested interest in protecting the great apes – the ZSM started an agriculture project to help the Congolese learn to grow crops and depend less on hunting wild animals.
*Model small-scale conservation methods that can be used throughout Congo

Starting in 2003, the U.S. government allocated $54 million to the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. This significant investment has triggered the involvement of international NGOs to establish bases in the region and work to develop bonobo conservation programs. This initiative should improve the likelihood of bonobo survival, but its success still may depend upon building greater involvement and capability in local and indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, Mac, (November/December 2004), [http://watha.org/in-depth/EP176A.pdf Vision for a Sustainable World], WORLDWATCH magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

The bonobo population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years, though surveys have been hard to carry out in war-ravaged central Congo. Estimates range from 60,000 to fewer than 50,000 living, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

In addition, concerned parties have addressed the crisis on several science and ecological websites. Organizations such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the [[African Wildlife Foundation]], and others, are trying to focus attention on the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.
