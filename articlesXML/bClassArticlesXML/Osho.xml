'''Osho''' (11 December 1931 – 19 January 1990), born in India as '''Chandra Mohan Jain''', and formerly known as '''Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh''', was a [[mysticism|mystic]], [[guru]], and spiritual teacher. The international [[Rajneesh movement]] has continued after his death. A professor of [[philosophy]], he travelled throughout India in the 1960s as a public speaker. He was a critic of [[socialism]], [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]],&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LFC44&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG26-27&quot; /&gt; and institutionalised [[religion]]s. He advocated a more open attitude towards [[human sexuality]], earning him the sobriquet &quot;sex guru&quot; in the Indian and later international press, although this attitude became more acceptable with time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joshi 1982 pp=1–4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1970, Rajneesh settled for a time in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], initiating disciples known as &quot;neo-sannyasins&quot; and expanding his spiritual teaching and work. In his discourses, he gave his original understanding and views on the writings of many religious traditions, mystics, and philosophers from around the world. He moved to [[Pune]] in 1974, where his disciples established a foundation and an [[ashram]] for his presence and work, offering a variety of &quot;transformational tools&quot; to the visitors. By the late 1970s, tensions mounted between the Indian government and the ashram. In mid-1981, the ashram was relocated to a purchased ranch property in the state of [[Oregon]] by a US foundation devoted to Osho's work. Almost immediately, the development met with opposition from the government, press, and citizenry, who took numerous legal actions to limit and ultimately terminate its existence. 

In 1985, Rajneesh revealed that his personal secretary and a small number of her close supporters had committed a number of serious crimes against their own community and against local residents and public officials, including the [[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack]] on the citizens of [[The Dalles, Oregon]], conspiracy to murder the US Attorney, attempted murder of Osho's physician and the local District Attorney, and a massive wiretap at Rajneeshpuram, including in Osho's bedroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF2-108&quot; /&gt; Osho was [[deportation|deported]] from the United States in accordance with a [[plea bargain]].&lt;ref name=Latkin342 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Staff  | first =  | coauthors =  | title =Wasco County History  | work =Oregon Historical County Records Guide  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =Oregon State Archives  | date =  | url =http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/local/county/wasco/hist.html | accessdate =22 November 2007  | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Farcweb.sos.state.or.us%2Fpages%2Frecords%2Flocal%2Fcounty%2Fwasco%2Fhist.html&amp;date=2012-03-24  | archivedate =24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Staff | first = | coauthors = | title =Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh | work =Newsmakers 1990 | pages =Issue 2 | language = | publisher =Gale Research | year =1990 | url = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Osho was deported from the US, twenty-one countries denied him entry, and he ultimately returned to Pune, where he died in 1990.

His ashram is today known as the [[Osho International Meditation Resort]]. His [[syncretic]] teachings emphasise the importance of [[meditation]], awareness, love, celebration, courage, creativity, and humor—qualities that he viewed as being suppressed by adherence to static belief systems, religious tradition, and socialisation. Osho's teachings have had a notable impact on Western [[New Age]] thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heelas|1996|pp=22, 40, 68, 72, 77, 95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GIA177&gt;{{harvnb|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their popularity has increased markedly since his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-TSSP&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=GIA182-183&gt;{{harvnb|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Childhood and adolescence: 1931–1950===
Osho was born Chandra Mohan Jain, the eldest of eleven children of a cloth merchant, at his maternal grandparents' house in Kuchwada; a small village in the [[Raisen District|Raisen district]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]] state in India.&lt;ref name=Mullan10-11&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mangalwadi88&gt;{{harvnb|Mangalwadi|1992|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents Babulal and Saraswati Jain, who were [[Taranpanthi]] [[Jainism|Jains]], let him live with his maternal grandparents until he was seven years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM11&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Osho's own account, this was a major influence on his development  because his grandmother gave him the utmost freedom, leaving him carefree without an imposed education or restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Osho|1985|p=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was seven years old, his grandfather died, and he went to [[Gadarwara]] to live with his parents.&lt;ref name=Mullan10-11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Joshi22-48 /&gt; Osho was profoundly affected by his grandfather's death, and again by the death of his childhood girlfriend and cousin Shashi from [[typhoid]] when he was 15, leading to a preoccupation with death that lasted throughout much of his childhood and youth.&lt;ref name=Joshi22-48&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|pp=22–25, 31, 45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his school years he was a rebellious, but gifted student, and acquired a reputation as a formidable debater.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osho became an [[Antitheism|anti-theist]], took an interest in [[hypnosis]] and  briefly associated with [[socialism]] and two [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalist organisations]]: the [[Indian National Army]] and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joshi38&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his membership in the organisations was short-lived as he could not subscribe to any external discipline, ideology or system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University years and public speaker: 1951–1970 ===
In 1951, aged nineteen, Osho began his studies at Hitkarini College in [[Jabalpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Süss|1996|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked to leave after conflicts with an instructor, he transferred to D. N. Jain College, also in Jabalpur.&lt;ref name=Carter43&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having proved himself to be disruptively argumentative, he was not required to attend college classes in D. N. Jain College except for examinations and used his free time to work for a few months as an assistant editor at a local newspaper.&lt;ref name=Joshi50&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began speaking in public at the annual ''[[Sarva Dharma Sammelan]]'' (Meeting of all faiths) held at Jabalpur, organised by the Taranpanthi Jain community into which he was born, and participated there from 1951 to 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Smarika, ''Sarva Dharma Sammelan'', 1974, ''[[Taran Panth|Taran Taran Samaj]]'', Jabalpur&lt;/ref&gt; He resisted his parents' pressure to get married.&lt;ref name=&quot;LT15&quot;&gt;(1985) Interview with Howard Sattler, 6PR Radio, Australia, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ocbZhRQS9I video available here]. Retrieved 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Osho later said he became spiritually enlightened on 21 March 1953, when he was 21 years old, in a mystical experience while sitting under a tree in the Bhanvartal garden in Jabalpur.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having completed his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in philosophy at D. N. Jain College in 1955, he joined the [[University of Sagar]], where in 1957 he earned his [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in philosophy (with distinction).&lt;ref name=Joshi185&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately secured a teaching post at [[Raipur]] Sanskrit College, but the [[Vice-Chancellor]] soon asked him to seek a transfer as he considered him a danger to his students' morality, character and religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;LFC44&quot; /&gt; From 1958,  he taught philosophy as a [[lecturer]] at [[Jabalpur University]], being promoted to professor in 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;LFC44&quot; /&gt; A popular lecturer, he was acknowledged by his peers as an exceptionally intelligent man who had been able to overcome the deficiencies of his early small-town education.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel to his university job, he travelled throughout India under the name Acharya Rajneesh (''[[Acharya]]'' means teacher or professor; Rajneesh was a nickname he had acquired in childhood), giving lectures critical of [[socialism]], [[Gandhi]] and institutional religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LFC44&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG26-27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that socialism would only socialise poverty, and he described Gandhi as a [[self-defeating personality disorder|masochist]] reactionary who worshipped poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG26-27&quot; /&gt; What India needed to escape its backwardness was [[capitalism]], science, modern technology and [[birth control]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt; He criticised orthodox Indian religions as dead, filled with empty ritual, oppressing their followers with fears of damnation and the promise of blessings.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG26-27&quot; /&gt; Such statements made him controversial, but also gained him a loyal following that included a number of wealthy merchants and businessmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis122&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Petersen|2005|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sought individual consultations from him about their spiritual development and daily life, in return for donations—a commonplace arrangement in India—and his practice grew rapidly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis122&quot; /&gt; From 1962, he began to lead 3- to 10-day meditation camps, and the first meditation centres (Jivan Jagruti Kendra) started to emerge around his teaching, then known as the Life Awakening Movement (Jivan Jagruti Andolan).&lt;ref name=&quot;ASIMA&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Osho|2000|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a controversial speaking tour in 1966, he resigned from his teaching post at the request of the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;LFC44&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1968 lecture series, later published under the title ''From Sex to Superconsciousness'', he scandalised [[Hindu]] leaders by calling for freer acceptance of sex and became known as the &quot;sex guru&quot; in the Indian press.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter45&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joshi 1982 pp=1–4&quot; /&gt; When in 1969 he was invited to speak at the Second World Hindu Conference, despite the misgivings of some Hindu leaders, he used the occasion to raise controversy again, claiming that &quot;any religion which considers life meaningless and full of misery, and teaches the hatred of life, is not a true religion. Religion is an art that shows how to enjoy life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joshi88&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterised priests as being motivated by self-interest, provoking the ''[[shankaracharya]]'' of [[Puri]], who tried in vain to have his lecture stopped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joshi88&quot; /&gt;

=== Bombay: 1970–1974 ===
[[File:Osho 1972 Birthday seek-index 268 0.26.ogv|thumb|240px|Osho's birthday celebrations at his Bombay residence on 11 December 1972]]

At a public meditation event in spring 1970, Osho presented his Dynamic Meditation method for the first time.&lt;ref name=LFC46&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Jabalpur for [[Mumbai|Bombay]] at the end of June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joshi94103&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|pp=94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 1970, he initiated his first group of disciples or [[neo-sannyasins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LFC47&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming a disciple meant assuming a new name and wearing the traditional orange dress of [[asceticism|ascetic]] Hindu holy men, including a [[Hindu prayer beads|''mala'']] (beaded necklace) carrying a locket with his picture.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-78&quot; /&gt; However, his sannyasins were encouraged to follow a celebratory rather than ascetic lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG32-33&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He himself was not to be worshipped but regarded as a [[catalyst|catalytic agent]], &quot;a sun encouraging the flower to open&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSG32-33&quot; /&gt;

He had by then acquired a secretary Laxmi Thakarsi Kuruwa, who as his first disciple had taken the name Ma Yoga Laxmi.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt; Laxmi was the daughter of one of his early followers, a wealthy Jain who had been a key supporter of the [[Nationalist Congress Party|National Congress Party]] during the struggle for [[Indian independence]], with close ties to [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] and [[Morarji Desai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt; She raised the money that enabled Osho to stop his travels and settle down.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-77&quot; /&gt; In December 1970, he moved to the Woodlands Apartments in Bombay, where he gave lectures and received visitors, among them his first Western visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joshi94103&quot; /&gt; He now travelled rarely, no longer speaking at open public meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joshi94103&quot; /&gt; In 1971, he adopted the title &quot;Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-78&quot; /&gt; ''[[Sri|Shree]]'' is a polite form of address roughly equivalent to the English &quot;Sir&quot;; ''[[Bhagwan]]'' means &quot;blessed one&quot;, used in Indian traditions as a term of respect for a human being in whom the divine is no longer hidden but apparent. Later, when he changed his name, he would redefine the meaning of Bhagwan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Süss29-30&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Süss|1996|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?query=bhagavan&amp;display=simple&amp;table=macdonell Macdonell Practical Sanskrit Dictionary] (see entry for ''bhagavat'', which includes ''bhagavan'' as the [[vocative]] case of ''bhagavat''). Retrieved 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pune ashram: 1974–1981 ===
The humid climate of Mumbai proved detrimental to Osho's health: he developed [[diabetes]], [[asthma]] and numerous [[allergy|allergies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-78&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, on the 21st anniversary of his experience in Jabalpur, he moved to a property in [[Koregaon Park]], [[Pune|Poona]], purchased with the help of Ma Yoga Mukta (Catherine Venizelos), a Greek shipping heiress.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-87&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1990|pp=48–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osho spoke at the Poona ashram from 1974 to 1981. The two adjoining houses and {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of land became the nucleus of an [[ashram]], and the property is still the heart of the present-day Osho International Meditation Resort.

In 1981, the increased tensions around the Poona ashram, along with criticism of its activities and threatened punitive action by the Indian authorities, provided an impetus for the ashram to consider the establishment of a new commune in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallis|1986|p=}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis124&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Petersen|2005|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Guru in Cowboy Country'', in: ''Asia Week'', 29 July 1983, pp. 26–36&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susan J.

Osho had coached Sheela in using media coverage to her advantage and during his period of public silence he privately stated that when Sheela spoke, she was speaking on his behalf.&lt;ref name=Zaitz1 /&gt; He had also supported her when disputes about her behaviour arose within the commune leadership, but in spring 1984, as tension amongst the inner circle peaked, a private meeting was convened with Sheela and his personal house staff.&lt;ref name=Zaitz1 /&gt; According to the testimony of Swami Devageet (Charles Harvey Newman)&lt;ref name=DevageetTest&gt;[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/73832-03-swami-devageet-testimony.html#document/p33/a14388 Transcript] of state grand jury testimony of the guru's dentist about life inside the guru's home and dealings with Sheela.

Several months later, on 30 October 1984, he ended his period of public silence, announcing that it was time to &quot;speak his own truths&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 1985 he resumed daily public discourses against Sheela's wishes, according to statements he made to the press.&lt;ref&gt;Osho: ''The Last Testament'', Vol. 2, Chapter 29 (transcript of interview with ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' magazine and [[ZDF]] TV, Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September 1985, a few days after Sheela and her entire management team had suddenly left the commune for Europe, Osho held a press conference in which he labelled Sheela and her associates a &quot;gang of fascists&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF2-108&quot; /&gt; He accused them of having committed a number of serious crimes, most of these dating back to 1984, and invited the authorities to investigate.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF2-108&quot; /&gt;

The alleged crimes, which he stated had been committed without his knowledge or consent, included the attempted murder of his personal physician, poisonings of public officials, [[wiretapping]] and [[bugging]] within the commune and within his own home, and a [[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack|bioterror attack]] on the citizens of [[The Dalles, Oregon]], using [[salmonella]] to impact the county elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF2-108&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986b|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his allegations were initially greeted with scepticism by outside observers,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimesroiled&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Douglas |title=Guru's Commune Roiled As Key Leader Departs |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=22 September 1985 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/us/guru-s-commune-roiled-as-key-leader-departs.html |accessdate=15 March 2008 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66P8G9jfy |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the subsequent investigation by the US authorities confirmed these accusations and resulted in the conviction of Sheela and several of her lieutenants.&lt;ref name=&quot;LFC233238&quot; /&gt;

As to &quot;preconceived intent&quot;, at the time of the investigation and prosecution, federal court appellate cases and the INS regulations permitted &quot;dual intent&quot;, a desire to stay, but a willingness to comply with the law if denied permanent residence.

When non-Indians in his party had their visas revoked, he moved on to [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, and then, a few weeks later, to [[Crete]]. Arrested after a few days by the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|KYP]], he flew to [[Geneva]], then to [[Stockholm]] and to [[Heathrow]], but was in each case refused entry. Next [[Canada]] refused landing permission, so his plane returned to [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon]] airport, [[Ireland]], to refuel. There he was allowed to stay for two weeks, at a hotel in [[Limerick]], on condition that he did not go out or give talks. He had been granted a Uruguayan identity card, one-year provisional residency and a possibility of permanent residency, so the party set out, stopping at [[Madrid]], where the plane was surrounded by the ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]''. He was allowed to spend one night at [[Dakar]], then continued to [[Recife]] and [[Montevideo]]. In [[Uruguay]], the group moved to a house at [[Punta del Este]] where Osho began speaking publicly until 19 June, after which he was &quot;invited to leave&quot; for no official reason. A two-week visa was arranged for Jamaica but on arrival in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] police gave the group 12 hours to leave.

From early 1988, Osho's discourses focused exclusively on [[Zen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF34&quot; /&gt; In late December, he said he no longer wished to be referred to as &quot;Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh&quot;, and in February 1989 took the name &quot;[[Oshō|Osho]] Rajneesh&quot;, shortened to &quot;Osho&quot; in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF34&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Süss30&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Süss|1996|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also requested that all trademarks previously branded with RAJNEESH be rebranded internationally to OSHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=OSHO: Background Information |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.osho.info/trademark_information.asp |format=[[etext]] |doi= |accessdate=10 January 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66PA0Dc3i |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His health continued to weaken. He delivered his last public discourse in April 1989, from then on simply sitting in silence with his followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF35-36&quot; /&gt; Shortly before his death, Osho suggested that one or more audience members at evening meetings (now referred to as the ''White Robe Brotherhood'') were subjecting him to some form of evil magic.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF37&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shunyo252253&gt;{{harvnb|Shunyo|1993|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; A search for the perpetrators was undertaken, but none could be found.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF37&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shunyo252253 /&gt;

=== Death ===
Osho died on 19 January 1990, aged 58, reportedly of [[heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press|AP]] (1990-01-20). [https://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=k4AiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wakFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2100,3636170&amp;dq=rajneesh+heart-failure&amp;hl=en &quot;Rajneesh Mourned in India&quot;], ''[[The Item]]''. Retrieved 5 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were placed in his newly built bedroom in Lao Tzu House at the Poona ashram. The [[epitaph]] reads, &quot;OSHO // Never Born // Never Died // Only Visited this Planet Earth between // Dec 11 1931&amp;nbsp;– Jan 19 1990&quot;.

== Teachings ==
Osho's teachings, delivered through his discourses, were not presented in an academic setting, but interspersed with jokes and delivered with a rhetoric that many found spellbinding.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF1-2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BM1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis was not static but changed over time: Osho revelled in paradox and contradiction, making his work difficult to summarise.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He delighted in engaging in behaviour that seemed entirely at odds with traditional images of enlightened individuals; his early lectures in particular were famous for their humor and their refusal to take anything seriously.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB169&quot; /&gt; All such behaviour, however capricious and difficult to accept, was explained as &quot;a technique for transformation&quot; to push people &quot;beyond the mind&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF6&quot; /&gt;

He spoke on major spiritual traditions including [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Hassidism]], [[Tantrism]], [[Taoism]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], on a variety of Eastern and Western mystics and on sacred scriptures such as the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM33&quot; /&gt; The sociologist Lewis F. Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu [[advaita]], in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held to be a kind of dance or play of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is an end in itself.&lt;ref name=Carter267&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his contemporary [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] did not approve of Osho, there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF2&quot; /&gt;

Osho also drew on a wide range of Western ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM33&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; His belief in the [[unity of opposites]] recalls [[Heraclitus]], while his description of man as a machine, condemned to the helpless acting out of unconscious, neurotic patterns, has much in common with [[Freud]] and [[Gurdjieff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prasad|1978|pp=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His vision of the &quot;new man&quot; transcending constraints of convention is reminiscent of [[Nietzsche]]'s ''Beyond Good and Evil'';&lt;ref name=&quot;CLFNR&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1987|p=}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; his promotion of [[sexual liberation]] bears comparison to [[D. H. Lawrence]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|1990|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his &quot;dynamic&quot; meditations owe a debt to [[Wilhelm Reich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke433&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|2006|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ego and the mind ===
According to Osho every human being is a ''[[Buddha]]'' with the capacity for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], capable of unconditional [[love]] and of responding rather than reacting to life, although the ego usually prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity that is nothing but a barrier of dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB171&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wallis131&gt;{{harvnb|Wallis|1986|p=}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|pp=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise man's innate being can flower in a move from the periphery to the centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wallis131 /&gt;

Osho views the mind first and foremost as a mechanism for survival, replicating behavioural strategies that have proven successful in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallis131&quot; /&gt; But the mind's appeal to the past, he said, deprives human beings of the ability to live authentically in the present, causing them to repress genuine emotions and to shut themselves off from joyful experiences that arise naturally when embracing the present moment: &quot;The mind has no inherent capacity for joy. … It only thinks about joy.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wallis131 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF3-4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that people poison themselves with all manner of [[neurosis|neuroses]], [[jealousy|jealousies]], and insecurities.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF4&quot; /&gt; He argued that [[psychological repression]], often advocated by religious leaders, makes suppressed feelings re-emerge in another guise, and that sexual repression resulted in societies obsessed with sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of suppressing, people should trust and accept themselves unconditionally.&lt;ref name=Wallis131 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF3-4&quot; /&gt; This should not merely be understood intellectually, as the mind could only assimilate it as one more piece of information: instead [[meditation]] was needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF4&quot; /&gt;

=== Meditation ===
Osho presented meditation not just as a practice but as a state of awareness to be maintained in every moment, a total awareness that awakens the individual from the sleep of mechanical responses conditioned by beliefs and expectations.&lt;ref name=Wallis131 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF4&quot; /&gt; He employed Western [[psychotherapy]] in the preparatory stages of meditation to create awareness of mental and emotional patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF5&quot; /&gt;

He suggested more than a hundred meditation techniques in total.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB172&quot; /&gt; His own &quot;active meditation&quot; techniques are characterised by stages of physical activity leading to silence.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these remains Dynamic Meditation,&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB172&quot; /&gt; which has been described as a kind of microcosm of his outlook.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB172&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performed with closed or blindfolded eyes, it comprises five stages, four of which are accompanied by music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon3-8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; First the meditator engages in ten minutes of rapid breathing through the nose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon3-8&quot; /&gt; The second ten minutes are for [[catharsis]]: &quot;Let whatever is happening happen. … Laugh, shout, scream, jump, shake—whatever you feel to do, do it!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon3-8&quot; /&gt; Next, for ten minutes one jumps up and down with arms raised, shouting Hoo! each time one lands on the flat of the feet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon3-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MFLM35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Osho|2004|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the fourth, silent stage, the meditator stops moving suddenly and totally, remaining completely motionless for fifteen minutes, witnessing everything that is happening.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon3-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MFLM35&quot; /&gt; The last stage of the meditation consists of fifteen minutes of dancing and celebration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon3-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MFLM35&quot; /&gt;

Osho developed other active meditation techniques, such as the Kundalini &quot;shaking&quot; meditation and the Nadabrahma &quot;humming&quot; meditation, which are less animated, although they also include physical activity of one sort or another.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF5&quot; /&gt; His later &quot;meditative therapies&quot; require sessions for several days, OSHO Mystic Rose comprising three hours of laughing every day for a week, three hours of weeping each day for a second week, and a third week with three hours of silent meditation.&lt;ref name=&quot;TLS198&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Aveling|1994|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes of &quot;witnessing&quot; enable a &quot;jump into awareness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF5&quot; /&gt; Osho believed such cathartic methods were necessary, since it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation. Once the methods had provided a glimpse of meditation people would be able to use other methods without difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with ''Riza Magazine'', Italy, [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-613021187886978268&amp; video available here]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Sannyas'' ===

Another key ingredient was his own presence as a [[Guru|master]]; &quot;A Master shares his being with you, not his philosophy. … He never does anything to the disciple.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiation he offered was another such device: &quot;... if your being can communicate with me, it becomes a communion. … It is the highest form of communication possible: a transmission without words. Our beings merge. This is possible only if you become a disciple.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF6&quot; /&gt; Ultimately though, as an explicitly &quot;self-parodying&quot; guru, Osho even deconstructed his own authority, declaring his teaching to be nothing more than a &quot;game&quot; or a joke.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB169&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB170&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasised that anything and everything could become an opportunity for meditation.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF6&quot; /&gt;

=== Renunciation and the &quot;New Man&quot; ===
Osho saw his &quot;neo-sannyas&quot; as a totally new form of spiritual discipline, or one that had once existed but since been forgotten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aveling94-86&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Aveling|1994|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the traditional Hindu [[sannyas]] had turned into a mere system of social renunciation and imitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aveling94-86&quot; /&gt; He emphasised complete inner freedom and the responsibility to oneself, not demanding superficial behavioural changes, but a deeper, inner transformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aveling94-86&quot; /&gt; Desires were to be accepted and surpassed rather than denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aveling94-86&quot; /&gt; Once this inner flowering had taken place, desires such as that for sex would be left behind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aveling94-86&quot; /&gt;

Osho said that he was &quot;the rich man's guru&quot; and that material poverty was not a genuine spiritual value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon114&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had himself photographed wearing sumptuous clothing and hand-made watches&lt;ref name=&quot;TOI3104&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=Neil Pate |date=3 January 2004 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/403145.cms |title=Celluloid Osho, quite a hit |publisher=Times of India |accessdate=11 July 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66P2DBWYT |archivedate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, while in Oregon, drove a different [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] each day&amp;nbsp;– his followers reportedly wanted to buy him 365 of them, one for each day of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindu&quot; /&gt; Publicity shots of the Rolls-Royces were sent to the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon114&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FF1-47&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986a|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have reflected both his advocacy of wealth and his desire to provoke American sensibilities, much as he had enjoyed offending Indian sensibilities earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon114&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis129&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Petersen|2005|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osho aimed to create a &quot;new man&quot; combining the spirituality of [[Gautama Buddha]] with the zest for life embodied by  [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]' ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'': &quot;He should be as accurate and objective as a scientist … as sensitive, as full of heart, as a poet … [and as] rooted deep down in his being as the mystic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB175&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; His term the &quot;new man&quot; applied to men and women equally, whose roles he saw as complementary; indeed, most of his movement's leadership positions were held by women.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new man, &quot;Zorba the Buddha&quot;, should reject neither [[science]] nor spirituality but embrace both.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF6&quot; /&gt; Osho believed humanity was threatened with extinction due to over-population, impending nuclear holocaust and diseases such as [[AIDS]], and thought many of society's ills could be remedied by scientific means.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF6&quot; /&gt; The new man would no longer be trapped in institutions such as family, [[marriage]], political ideologies and religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB169&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2002|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect Osho is similar to other counter-culture gurus, and perhaps even certain [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[Deconstructionism|deconstructional]] thinkers.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB169&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Euthanasia for crippled, blind, deaf and dumb children and genetic selection ===
Osho spoke many times of the dangers of [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], and advocated universal legalisation of contraception and abortion. He described the religious prohibitions thereof as criminal, and argued that the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|declaration]] of the human &quot;[[right to life]]&quot; played into the hands of religious campaigners.

According to Osho, one has no right to knowingly inflict a lifetime of suffering: life should begin only at birth, and even then, &quot;If a child is born deaf, dumb, and we cannot do anything, and the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep&quot; rather than &quot;take the risk of burdening the earth with a crippled, blind child.&quot; He argued that this simply freed the soul to inhabit a healthy body instead: &quot;Only the body goes back into its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb. Nothing is destroyed. If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age. So even if a child is born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body.&quot;

He stated that the decision to have a child should be a medical matter, and that oversight of population and genetics must be kept in the realm of science, outside of politicians' control: &quot;If genetics is in the hands of Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, what will be the fate of the world?&quot; He believed that in the right hands, these measures could be used for good: &quot;Once we know how to change the program, thousands of possibilities open up. We can give every man and woman the best of everything. There is no need for anyone to suffer unnecessarily. Being retarded, crippled, blind, ugly – all these will be possible to change.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaible&quot;&gt;Osho, ''The Greatest Challenge: The Golden Future'', [http://www.osho.com/magazine/oshointro/VisionGoldenIndexDetails.cfm?Golden=birth available] here&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Reference needs verification --&gt;

=== Osho's &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; ===
In his early days as Acharya Rajneesh, a correspondent once asked Osho for his &quot;[[Ten Commandments]]&quot;. In reply, Osho noted that it was a difficult matter because he was against any kind of commandment, but &quot;just for fun&quot;, set out the following:

{{cquote|
# Never obey anyone's command unless it is coming from within you also.
# There is no God other than life itself.
# Truth is within you, do not search for it elsewhere.
# Love is prayer.
# To become a nothingness is the door to truth. Nothingness itself is the means, the goal and attainment.
# Life is now and here.
# Live wakefully.
# Do not swim—float.
# Die each moment so that you can be new each moment.
# Do not search. That which is, is. Stop and see.}}

He underlined numbers 3, 7, 9 and 10.&lt;ref name=10c&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Petersen|2005|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas expressed in these Commandments have remained constant [[leitmotif]]s in his movement.&lt;ref name=10c /&gt;

=== Legacy ===
While Osho's teachings met with strong rejection in his home country during his lifetime, there has been a change in Indian public opinion since Osho's death.&lt;ref name=GIA181-183&gt;{{harvnb|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|pp=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TJ&quot;&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Flaw.incometaxindia.gov.in%2FDitTaxmann%2FIncomeTaxActs%2F2007ITAct%2F%255B2005%255D148TAXMAN0396%28BOM%29.htm&amp;date=2012-03-24 Bombay High Court tax judgment], sections 12–14.

== Reception ==
Osho is generally considered one of the most controversial spiritual leaders to have emerged from India in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Mehta133&gt;{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chryss207-208&quot; /&gt; His message of sexual, emotional, spiritual, and institutional liberation, as well as the pleasure he took in causing offence, ensured that his life was surrounded by controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMF7&quot; /&gt; Osho became known as the &quot;sex guru&quot; in India, and as the &quot;Rolls-Royce guru&quot; in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon114&quot; /&gt; He attacked traditional concepts of nationalism, openly expressed contempt for politicians, and poked fun at the leading figures of various religions, who in turn found his arrogance unbearable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mehta83&gt;{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; His teachings on sex, marriage, family, and relationships contradicted traditional values and aroused a great deal of anger and opposition around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT160981&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joshi|1982|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His movement was widely feared and loathed as a [[cult]]. Osho was seen to live &quot;in ostentation and offensive opulence&quot;, while his followers, most of whom had severed ties with outside friends and family and donated all or most of their money and possessions to the commune, might be at a mere &quot;subsistence level&quot;.&lt;ref name=Zaitz4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Galanter&gt;{{harvnb|Galanter|1989|pp=95–96, 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appraisal by scholars of religion ===
Academic assessments of Osho's work have been mixed and often directly contradictory. Uday Mehta saw errors in his interpretation of Zen and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], speaking of &quot;gross contradictions and inconsistencies in his teachings&quot; that &quot;exploit&quot; the &quot;ignorance and gullibility&quot; of his listeners.&lt;ref name=Mehta&gt;{{harvnb|Mehta|1993|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist Bob Mullan wrote in 1983 of &quot;a borrowing of truths, half-truths and occasional misrepresentations from the great traditions&quot;... often bland, inaccurate, spurious and extremely contradictory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM48&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh B. Urban also found Osho's teaching neither original nor especially profound and concluded that most of its content had been borrowed from various Eastern and Western philosophies.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB169&quot; /&gt; [[George Chryssides]], on the other hand, found such descriptions of Osho's teaching as a &quot;potpourri&quot; of various religious teachings unfortunate because Osho was &quot;no amateur philosopher&quot;. Drawing attention to Osho's academic background he stated that; &quot;Whether or not one accepts his teachings, he was no charlatan when it came to expounding the ideas of others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chryss207-208&quot; /&gt; He described Osho as primarily a Buddhist teacher, promoting an independent form of &quot;Beat Zen&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chryss207-208&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chryssides|1999|pp=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and viewed the unsystematic, contradictory and outrageous aspects of Osho's teachings as seeking to induce a change in people, not as philosophy lectures aimed at intellectual understanding of the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chryss207-208&quot; /&gt;

Similarly with respect to Osho's embracing of western counter-culture and the human potential movement, though Mullan acknowledged that Osho's range and imagination were second to none,&lt;ref name=&quot;BM48&quot; /&gt; and that many of his statements were quite insightful and moving, perhaps even profound at times,&lt;ref name=&quot;BM32&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; he perceived  &quot;a potpourri of counter-culturalist and post-counter-culturalist ideas&quot; focusing on love and freedom, the need to live for the moment, the importance of self, the feeling of &quot;being okay&quot;, the mysteriousness of life, the fun ethic, the individual's responsibility for their own destiny, and the need to drop the ego, along with fear and guilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM48-89-90&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=48, 89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Mehta Osho's appeal to his Western disciples was based on his social experiments, which established a philosophical connection between the Eastern [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru tradition]] and the Western [[growth movement]].&lt;ref name=Mehta133 /&gt; He saw this as a [[marketing strategy]] to meet the desires of his audience,&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB169&quot; /&gt; Urban, too, viewed Osho as negating a dichotomy between spiritual and material desires, reflecting the preoccupation with the body and sexuality characteristic of late [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[consumer culture]] in tune with the socio-economic conditions of his time.&lt;ref name=GIA183 /&gt;

[[Peter B. Clarke]] confirmed that most participators felt they had made progress in self-actualization as defined by American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] and the [[human potential movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke466&quot; /&gt; He stated that the style of therapy Osho devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, had proved influential among other therapy practitioners and new age groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke432-433&quot; /&gt; Yet Clarke believes that the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was &quot;neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke466&quot; /&gt;

In 2005, Urban observed that Osho had undergone a &quot;remarkable [[apotheosis]]&quot; after his return to India, and especially in the years since his death, going on to describe him as a powerful illustration of what [[F. Max Müller]], over a century ago, called &quot;that world-wide circle through which, like an electric current, Oriental thought could run to the West and Western thought return to the East&quot;.&lt;ref name=GIA183&gt;{{harvnb|Forsthoefel|Humes|2005|pp=181–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke also noted that Osho has come to be &quot;seen as an important teacher within India itself&quot; who is &quot;increasingly recognised as a major spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, at the forefront of the current 'world-accepting' trend of spirituality based on self-development&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke432-433&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|2006|pp=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appraisal as charismatic leader ===
A number of commentators have remarked upon Osho's charisma. Comparing Osho with [[Gurdjieff]], [[Anthony Storr]] wrote that Osho was &quot;personally extremely impressive&quot;, noting that &quot;many of those who visited him for the first time felt that their most intimate feelings were instantly understood, that they were accepted and unequivocally welcomed rather than judged. [Osho] seemed to radiate energy and to awaken hidden possibilities in those who came into contact with him&quot;.&lt;ref name=Storr47&gt;{{harvnb|Storr|1996|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sannyasins have stated that hearing Osho speak, they &quot;fell in love with him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SJP122&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|1988|p=122}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BM67&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan J. Palmer noted that even critics attested to the power of his presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJP122&quot; /&gt; James S. Gordon, a psychiatrist and researcher, recalls inexplicably finding himself laughing like a child, hugging strangers and having tears of gratitude in his eyes after a glance by Osho from within his passing Rolls-Royce.&lt;ref name=Gordon109&gt;{{harvnb|Gordon|1987|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] concluded upon listening to Osho in person that he was a brilliant lecturer, and expressed surprise at his talent as a comedian, which had not been apparent from reading his books, as well as the hypnotic quality of his talks, which had a profound effect on his audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;FF2-106&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|FitzGerald|1986b|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Milne (Swami Shivamurti), an ex-devotee who between 1973 and 1982 worked closely with Osho as leader of the Poona Ashram Guard&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallis|1986|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as his personal bodyguard,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1988|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belfrage|1981|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that their first meeting left him with a sense that far more than words had passed between them: &quot;There is no invasion of privacy, no alarm, but it is as if his soul is slowly slipping inside mine, and in a split second transferring vital information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|1986|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milne also observed another facet of Osho's charismatic ability in stating that he was &quot;a brilliant manipulator of the unquestioning disciple&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milne|1986|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh B. Urban noted that Osho appeared to fit with [[Max Weber]]'s classical image of [[charismatic authority|the charismatic figure]], being held to possess &quot;an extraordinary supernatural power or 'grace', which was essentially irrational and affective&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB168&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Urban|1996|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osho corresponded to Weber's pure charismatic type in rejecting all rational laws and institutions and claiming to subvert all hierarchical authority, though Urban notes that the promise of absolute freedom inherent in this resulted in bureaucratic organisation and institutional control within larger communes.&lt;ref name=&quot;HBU-ZTB168&quot; /&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that Osho, like other charismatic leaders, may have had a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Storr|1996|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huth|1993|pp=204–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt; In his paper ''The Narcissistic Guru: A Profile of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh'', Ronald O. Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at [[Oregon State University]], argued that Osho exhibited all the typical features of [[narcissistic personality disorder]], such as a grandiose sense of self-importance and uniqueness; a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success; a need for constant attention and admiration; a set of characteristic responses to threats to self-esteem; disturbances in interpersonal relationships; a preoccupation with [[personal grooming]] combined with frequent resorting to prevarication or outright lying; and a lack of empathy.&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt; Drawing on Osho's reminiscences of his childhood in his book ''Glimpses of a Golden Childhood'', he suggested that Osho suffered from a fundamental lack of [[parental discipline]], due to his growing up in the care of overindulgent grandparents.&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt; Osho's self-avowed Buddha status, he concluded, was part of a [[delusion]]al system associated with his narcissistic personality disorder; a condition of ego-inflation rather than egolessness.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{harvnb|Clarke|1988|p=}}, reprinted in {{harvnb|Aveling|1999|pp=55–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wider appraisal as a thinker and speaker ===
There are widely divergent assessments of Osho's qualities as a thinker and speaker. [[Khushwant Singh]], an eminent author, historian, and former editor of the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', has described Osho as &quot;the most original thinker that India has produced: the most erudite, the most clearheaded and the most innovative&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bhawuk&gt;{{harvnb|Bhawuk|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh believes that Osho was a &quot;free-thinking agnostic&quot; who had the ability to explain the most abstract concepts in simple language, illustrated with witty anecdotes, who mocked gods, [[prophet]]s, scriptures, and religious practices, and gave a totally new dimension to religion.&lt;ref&gt;Khushwant Singh, writing in the ''[[Indian Express]]'', 25 December 1988, quoted e.g. [http://www.indiaclub.com/shop/SearchResults.asp?ProdStock=11216 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]] has called Osho a &quot;[[Wittgenstein]] of religions&quot;, ranking him as one of the greatest figures of the 20th century; in his view, Osho had performed a radical deconstruction of the word games played by the world's religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sloterdijk|1996|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, a number of commentators in the popular press were dismissive of Osho.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM8-9&quot; /&gt; The Australian critic [[Clive James]] scornfully referred to him as &quot;Bagwash&quot;, likening the experience of listening to one of his discourses to sitting in a [[laundrette]] and watching &quot;your tattered underwear revolve soggily for hours while exuding grey suds. The Bagwash talks the way that looks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BM8-9&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mullan|1983|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bagwash /&gt; James finished by saying that Osho, though a &quot;fairly benign example of his type&quot;, was a &quot;rebarbative dingbat who manipulates the manipulable into manipulating one another&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM8-9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bagwash /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Adieu to God: Why Psychology Leads to Atheism&quot; Mick Power. p114&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to an enthusiastic review of Osho's talks by [[Bernard Levin]] in ''[[The Times]]'', Dominik Wujastyk, also writing in ''The Times'', similarly expressed his opinion that the talk he heard while visiting the Poona ''ashram'' was of a very low standard, wearyingly repetitive and often factually wrong, and stated that he felt disturbed by the [[personality cult]] surrounding Osho.&lt;ref name=&quot;BM8-9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(10 August 2004) [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fobituaries%2F1469028%2FBernard-Levin.html&amp;date=2012-03-17 Obituary of Bernard Levin], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Retrieved 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the [[Seattle Post Intelligencer]] in January  1990, American author [[Tom Robbins]] stated that based on his readings of Osho's books, he was convinced Osho was the 20th century's &quot;greatest spiritual teacher&quot;. Robbins, while stressing that he was not a disciple, further stated that he had &quot;read enough vicious propaganda and slanted reports to suspect that he was one of the most maligned figures in history&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bhawuk /&gt; Osho's commentary on the [[Sikh]] scripture known as ''[[Japuji]]'' was hailed as the best available by [[Giani Zail Singh]], the former [[President of India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TJ&quot; /&gt; In 2011, author [[Farrukh Dhondy]] reported that film star [[Kabir Bedi]] was a fan of Osho, and viewed Osho's works as &quot;the most sublime interpretations of Indian philosophy that he had come across&quot;. Dhondy himself viewed Osho as &quot;the cleverest intellectual confidence trickster that India has produced. His output of the 'interpretation' of Indian texts is specifically slanted towards a generation of disillusioned westerners who wanted (and perhaps still want) to 'have their cake, eat it' [and] claim at the same time that cake-eating is the highest virtue according to ancient-fused-with-scientific wisdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(25 April 2011) [[Farrukh Dhondy]].
