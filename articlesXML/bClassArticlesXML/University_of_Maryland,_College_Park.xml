==History==
{{main article|History of the University of Maryland, College Park}}

===Early history===
[[File:Charles Benedict Calvert - photo portrait seated.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Benedict Calvert|Charles Calvert]], founder]]
On March 6, 1856, the forerunner of today's University of Maryland was chartered as the '''Maryland Agricultural College'''. Two years later, [[Charles Benedict Calvert]], a future U.S. Congressman, purchased {{convert|420|acre|km2}} of the [[Riversdale (Maryland)|Riverdale Plantation]] in College Park. Calvert founded the school later that year. On October 5, 1859, the first 34 students entered the Maryland Agricultural College.&lt;ref name=&quot;umtimeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = University of Maryland Timeline| accessdate =June 18, 2010| url = http://www.urhome.umd.edu/timeline/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school became a [[land grant college]] in February 1864.&lt;ref name=&quot;umtimeline&quot;/&gt;

===Bankruptcy and revival===
[[File:UMD Morrill Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]], built in 1898, is the oldest academic building on campus]]
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Confederate soldiers under Brigadier General [[Bradley Tyler Johnson]] moved past the college on July 12, 1864 as part of Jubal Early's raid on [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Benjamin|title=The Confederate Army's &quot;Old South Ball&quot; at the University of Maryland: Fact or Fiction?|url=http://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2015/06/30/confederate-armys-old-south-ball-university-maryland-fact-or-fiction|website=Boundary Stones|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, financial problems forced the administrators to sell off {{convert|200|acre}} of land, and the continuing decline in enrollment sent the Maryland Agricultural College into bankruptcy. For the next two years the campus was used as a boys preparatory school.&lt;ref name=&quot;umtimeline&quot;/&gt;
Following the Civil War, in February 1866 the Maryland legislature assumed half ownership of the school. The college thus became in part a state institution. By October 1867, the school reopened with 11 students. In the next six years, enrollment grew and the school's debt was paid off. In 1873, [[Samuel Jones (Confederate Army officer)|Samuel Jones]], a former Confederate Major General, became president of the college.

Twenty years later, the federally funded Agricultural Experiment Station was established there. During the same period, state laws granted the college regulatory powers in several areas—including controlling farm disease, inspecting feed, establishing a state weather bureau and geological survey, and housing the board of forestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;umtimeline&quot;/&gt; [[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]] (the oldest instructional building still in use on campus) was built the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;umtimeline&quot;/&gt;

===The Great Fire of 1912===
[[File:MAC fire 1912.jpg|thumb|The campus during the 1912 fire]]
On November 29, 1912, a fire destroyed the barracks where the students were housed, all the school's records, and most of the academic buildings, leaving only [[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]] untouched. There were no injuries or fatalities, and all but two students returned to the university and insisted on classes continuing.&lt;ref name=&quot;umtimeline&quot;/&gt; Students were housed by families in neighboring towns until housing could be rebuilt, although a new administration building was not built until the 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;umtimeline&quot;/&gt;
A large brick and concrete compass inlaid in the ground designates the former center of campus as it existed in 1912.

===Modern history===
[[File:Univ of Maryland campus 1938.jpg|thumb|The University of Maryland campus as it appeared in 1938 before the dramatic expansion engineered by [[Curley Byrd|President Byrd]]]]
The state took control of the school in 1916, and the institution was renamed '''Maryland State College'''. That year, the first female students enrolled at the school. On April 9, 1920, the college became part of the existing [[University of Maryland, Baltimore|University of Maryland]], replacing [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College, Annapolis]] as the University's undergraduate campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordell|first1=Eugene Fauntleroy|title=Historical Sketch of the University of Maryland, School of Medicine (1807–1890)|date=1891|publisher=I. Friedenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tilghman|first1=Tench Francis|title=The Early History of St. John's College in Annapolis|date=1984|publisher=St. John's College Press|location=Annapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the graduate school on the College Park campus awarded its first PhD degrees and the university's enrollment reached 500 students. In 1925 the university was accredited by the [[Association of American Universities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;umtimeline&quot;/&gt;

By the time the first black students enrolled at the university in 1951, enrollment had grown to nearly 10,000 students—4,000 of whom were women. Prior to 1951, many black students in Maryland were enrolled at the [[University of Maryland, Eastern Shore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/university-maryland-eastern-shore-1887 |title=University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (1886– ) &amp;#124; The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |publisher=The Black Past |date=July 1, 1970 |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 President Wilson H. Elkins made a push to increase academic standards at the University. His efforts resulted in the creation of one of the first Academic Probation Plans. The first year the plan went into effect, 1,550 students (18% of the total student body) faced expulsion.

[[Phi Beta Kappa]] established a chapter at the university in 1964. In 1969, the university was elected to the Association of American Universities. The school continued to grow, and by the fall of 1985 reached an enrollment of 38,679.&lt;ref name=&quot;umtimeline&quot;/&gt; Like many colleges during the Vietnam War, the university was the site of student protests and had curfews enforced by the [[Maryland Army National Guard|National Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = The Baltimore Sun| title = U. of M.

[[File:Memorial Chapel at UMCP, front view off-center, August 21, 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Memorial Chapel (University of Maryland)|Memorial Chapel]]]]

In a massive 1988 restructuring of the state higher education system, the school was designated as the flagship campus of the newly formed [[University of Maryland System]] (later changed to the University System of Maryland in 1997) and was formally named University of Maryland, College Park. All of the five campuses in the former network were designated as distinct campuses in the new system.  However, in 1997 the [[Maryland General Assembly]] passed legislation allowing the University of Maryland, College Park, to be known simply as the University of Maryland, recognizing the campus' role as the flagship institution of the University System of Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Office of University Communications| title = University of Maryland Identity Guide
| url = http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/media/identityguide.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other University System of Maryland institutions with the name &quot;University of Maryland&quot; are not satellite campuses of the University of Maryland, College Park. The [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]], is the only other school permitted to confer certain degrees from the &quot;University of Maryland&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2004, the university began constructing the {{convert|150|acre|adj=on}} &quot;M Square Research Park,&quot; which includes facilities affiliated with the [[U.S. Department of Defense]], [[Food and Drug Administration]], and the new National Center for Weather and Climate Prediction, affiliated with The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msquare.umd.edu/ |title=M Square Research Park, University of Maryland |publisher=Msquare.umd.edu |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, ground was broken on a new $128-million, {{convert|158068|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Physical Science Complex, including an advanced quantum science laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Tune| first = Lee| title = Top Officials Cite Importance of Planned UM Physical Sciences Complex| accessdate =June 18, 2010| url = http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/scitech/release.cfm?ArticleID=2165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programs===

[[File:UMD stairway.JPG|thumb|A stairway in south campus]]
The university hosts &quot;living-learning&quot; programs which allow students with similar academic interests to live in the same residential community, take specialized courses, and perform research in those areas of expertise. An example is the Honors College, which is geared towards students meeting academic requirements and consists of several of the university's honors programs. The Honors College welcomes students into a community of faculty and undergraduates. The Honors College offers seven living and learning programs: Advanced Cyber Security, Digital Cultures &amp; Creativity, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Honors Humanities, Gemstone, Integrated Life Sciences, and University Honors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = University of Maryland| title = Honors College University of Maryland| accessdate =June 18, 2010| url = http://www.honors.umd.edu/overview.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Design | Cultures + Creativity (DCC), started in 2009, is directed by artist Jason Farman and run by faculty and [[graduate school|graduate]] students. DCC students are housed in a residence hall together and take a 16 credit, two year interdisciplinary curriculum centered on digital culture and innovative thinking in the digital and creative world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcc.umd.edu/ |title=Digital Cultures and Creativity |publisher=Dcc.umd.edu |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program (EIP) is a living and learning program for Honors College freshmen and sophomores, helping build entrepreneurial mindsets, skill sets, and relationships for the development of solutions to today's problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute|title=Mtech: Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program |url=http://www.mtech.umd.edu/educate/eip/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through learning, courses, seminars, workshops, competitions, and volunteerism, students receive an education in entrepreneurship and innovation. In collaboration with faculty and mentors who have launched new ventures, all student teams develop an innovative idea and write a product plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maryland Technology Enterprise Institute|title=Mtech: Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program|url=http://www.mtech.umd.edu/educate/eip/overview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Honors Humanities is the honors program for beginning undergraduates with interests in the humanities and creative arts. The selective two-year living-learning program combines a small [[liberal arts college]] environment with the resources of a large [[research university]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honorshumanities.umd.edu/ |title=Honors Humanities :: Home |publisher=Honorshumanities.umd.edu |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gemstone is a multidisciplinary four-year research program for select undergraduate honors students of all majors. Under guidance of faculty mentors and Gemstone staff, teams of students design, direct and conduct research, exploring the interdependence of science and technology with society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemstone.umd.edu/about/index.html |title=About Gemstone, Clark School of Engineering, Engineering, University of Maryland |publisher=Gemstone.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Integrated Life Sciences (ILS) is the honors program for students interested in all aspects of biological research and biomedicine. The College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences has partnered with the Honors College to create the ILS program, which offers nationally recognized innovations in the multidisciplinary training of life science and pre-medical students. The objective of the ILS experience is to prepare students for success in graduate, medical, dental, or other professional schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Maryland, College Park|title=About {{!}} Integrated Life Sciences in the Honors College at University of Maryland|url=http://ils.umd.edu/about}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are arboretum tours, such as the centralized Tree Walking Tour which is based around McKeldin Mall and features 56 specimen trees.

Additionally, there are nearly {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of [[urban forest]] located on campus&lt;ref name=&quot;universityvisitorsnetwork1&quot;/&gt; and the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]] has named the university to its 'Tree Campus USA' list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arborday.org/programs/treecampususa/campuses.cfm |title=Arbor Day Foundation website, List of Tree Campus USA Schools |publisher=Arborday.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recreational Paint Branch Trail, part of the [[Anacostia Tributary Trails]] system, cuts through campus, as does the [[Paint Branch]] stream, a tributary of the [[Northeast Branch Anacostia River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/counties/princegeorges.html |title=Maryland Atlas of Greenways, Water Trails, and Green Infrastructure|publisher=Dnr.state.md.us |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKeldin Mall serves as the center of campus. On the east and west ends of McKeldin Mall lie the Main Administration Building and [[McKeldin Library]]. Academic buildings surround McKeldin Mall on the north and south ends, and are the homes to many departments in the [[University of Maryland College of Behavioral and Social Sciences|College of Behavioral and Social Sciences]], College of Arts and Humanities, and the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. West of McKeldin Mall is the North Hill Community, and south of McKeldin Mall lies [[Morrill Hall (University of Maryland)|Morrill Hall]] and the Morrill Quad, which was the original center of campus. South of the Morrill Quad are the South Hill and South Campus Commons Communities, and to the southwest is the Southwest Mall and the [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]]. Running parallel to McKeldin Mall to the north is Campus Drive, the main thoroughfare through campus.

The [[Adele H. Stamp Student Union]] sits along Campus Drive near the center of campus, and serves as a [[transit center]] for campus, where [[Shuttle-UM]] (the university's bus service) and municipal buses pick up and drop off passengers.  Hornbake Plaza home to [[Hornbake Library]] and several buildings housing academic departments also lies on Campus Drive, east of Stamp.

Starting in 2010, the University System of Maryland and the Department of General Services began three projects that were to be continued for the next twenty years. The three projects included: a solar project in [[Mount St. Mary's University]], a wind project in [[Western Maryland]], and another wind project in [[West Virginia]]. The first of these projects, the solar project, is a 16 megawatt project. The first wind project is 10 megawatts, and the second is 55 megawatts.

The projects will allow the university to receive 15 percent of their purchased energy from these renewable energy resources. Also in 2010, the university's dining hall, Ellicott Dining Hall, installed solar panels which would provide up to 30 percent of the energy for water heating in the dining hall. To do this the university installed 20 panels with 3 solar storage tanks, pumps, temperature sensors, and controls. The system will increasingly provide more of the dining hall's water needs due to the storage tanks.&lt;ref name=sustainability.umd.edu /&gt;

Maryland also promotes the use of reusable to-go containers at the dining hall, or OZZI containers, since the official launching of the program in August 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamondbackonline.com/news/new-reusable-dining-container-use-grows-1.2792784#.T6bhmJhEa_Z ] {{wayback|url=http://www.diamondbackonline.com/news/new-reusable-dining-container-use-grows-1.2792784#.T6bhmJhEa_Z |date=20120505155422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students pay a $5 fee to initially use the container, but receive a coin when they return it to the dispenser. With the coin, the use of the container is cost-free.

In January 2011, Maryland installed occupancy sensors in nearly all of the 300 general-purpose classrooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;diamondbackonline.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbknews.com/archives/article_f9c82e1d-0ce7-5cb3-92c8-542d52ac2eea.html|title=Motion sensors installed in classrooms to save energy|date=February 1, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505143648/http://www.diamondbackonline.com/news/motion-sensors-installed-in-classrooms-to-save-energy-1.2764215|archivedate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These occupancy sensors automatically turn off the lights after 30 minutes if there is no motion in a room.

In October 2013 the University's College of Behavioral and Social Sciences (BSOS) became the university's first college to form their own Sustainability Task Force. In April 2014 the Task Force produced BSOS's Sustainability Plan to advance campus sustainability and complement the University's Climate Action Plan to help the university become a national model of a green university. It is the first plan of its kind at the college level at the university, and was designed to serve as a guide for other colleges to join BSOS in this effort to improve the sustainability of the campus and community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/about-us/sustainability-plan|title=Sustainability Plan|publisher=|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014 the BSOS Sustainability Task Force expanded to include a student Sustainability Task Force.

[[File:UMD brick entryway.JPG|thumb|right|Brick entryway near the South Hill Community]]
There are two main residential areas on campus, North Campus and South Campus, which are further divided into seven residential communities. North Campus is made up of Cambridge Community (which consists of five residence halls), Denton Community (which currently consists of four halls, including Oakland hall which opened in the fall semester of 2011), and Ellicott Community (consisting of three halls).

South Campus includes the North Hill Community, made up of nine [[Georgian-style]] halls located immediately west of [[McKeldin Mall]], South Hill Community, made up of fourteen small residence halls for upperclassmen, Leonardtown Community, which offers apartment-style living and is further divided into Old Leonardtown (consisting of six buildings) and New Leonardtown (also consisting of six buildings), the South Campus Commons Community, which consists of seven apartment-style buildings (the seventh and most recent building being opened in January 2010), and the Courtyards, a garden style apartment community in north campus consisting of seven buildings.

The South Campus Commons Community and Courtyards, while built on campus, are managed by a private company, Capstone On-Campus Management, as part of a public-private partnership between the company and the University of Maryland.

The university does not have family housing. As of 2011 some students with families have advocated for the addition of family housing.&lt;ref&gt;Romas, Maria. &quot;[http://www.diamondbackonline.com/news/no-place-for-children-1.2111513 No place for children].&quot; ''[[The Diamondback]]''.

A small public airport in College Park, [[College Park Airport]], lies nearly adjacent to campus, but operations are limited.

A free shuttle service, known as [[Shuttle-UM]], is available for UMD students, faculty, and staff. The university is served by an off-campus stop on the [[Washington DC Metro]] [[Green Line (Washington Metro)|Green Line]] called [[College Park – University of Maryland (Washington Metro)|College Park – University of Maryland]]. The station is also served by the [[Camden Line]] of the [[MARC train]], which runs between [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington DC|Washington]]. A Shuttle-UM bus (Route 104) arrives at the metro station every five minutes during fall and spring semesters (every ten minutes during the summer) to bring all visitors to campus (stopping in front of the [[Stamp Student Union]]). The [[DC Metrobus]] and the [[Prince George's County]] [[TheBus (Prince George's County)|TheBus]] bus services also stop on campus. There is an additional service called [[Nite Ride]] which is a curb-to-curb service offered every night from 5:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 7:30&amp;nbsp;am.

[[File:Comcast Center interior.jpg|thumb|[[XFINITY Center (College Park, Maryland)|XFINITY Center]], home of Maryland basketball]]The university sponsors varsity athletic teams in 20&amp;nbsp;men's and women's sports. The teams, named the &quot;Terrapins&quot;, represent Maryland in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] competition. Maryland became a founding member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in 1952, but left to join the [[Big Ten Conference]] July 1, 2014.  As of April 2015, Maryland's athletic teams have been awarded 42&amp;nbsp;national championships by the NCAA, [[United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association|USILA]], [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]], and [[National Cheerleaders Association|NCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umterps.com/genrel/md-national-championships.html |title=National Championships |publisher=Umterps.com |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2010, ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' named the University of Maryland's athletic facilities the best in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2008/07/28/daily36.html Maryland colleges get high and low marks on Princeton Review study], ''Baltimore Business Journal'', August 1, 2008.

Williams led Maryland basketball to national prominence with two [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] appearances, and in 2002, a [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|national championship]]. On February 7, 2006, Gary Williams won his 349th game to surpass Driesell and became Maryland's all-time leader among basketball coaches. In May 2011 Williams retired allowing for the entrance of new head coach, Mark Turgeon. The court at XFINITY Center at the UMD was named in honor of the dearly beloved coach, Gary Williams. [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland football]] is also popular at the university.&lt;ref name=crawler&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fD81Hmy1tcQC ''University of Maryland College Prowler Off the Record''], p. 84–86, 2005, ISBN 1-59658-160-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Terrapins were awarded the national championship by the wire services in 1953, and in 1951, by several retroactive selectors.

==Testudo==
[[File:UMD Testudo Statue.JPG|thumb|Statue of Testudo on campus]]
In 1932, [[Curley Byrd]]—who served as the university's football and baseball coach, athletic director, and president—proposed adopting the [[diamondback terrapin]] as a mascot. The first statue of Testudo cast in bronze was donated by the Class of 1933 and displayed on [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|Baltimore Avenue]] in front of [[Ritchie Coliseum]]. However, the 300-pound sculpture was subjected to vandalism by visiting college athletic teams.&lt;ref name=testudohist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umterps.com/trads/md-m-fb-mas.html |title=Testudo: Tale of the Top Shell |publisher=Umterps.com |date=May 23, 1933 |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johns Hopkins – Maryland rivalry#Early years|One such incident]] occurred in 1947 when students from [[Johns Hopkins University]] stole the bronze statue and moved it to their campus. Maryland students traveled to [[Baltimore]] to retrieve it, laying siege to the house where it was hidden. Over 200 [[Baltimore Police Department|city police]] responded to quell the riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lee| first = Edward| title = Catalino, Reed lead No. 5 Terps past No. 20 Mids – Baltimore Sun| work = Baltimore Sun

Testudo was later filled with 700 pounds of cement and fastened to his pedestal to prevent future removals, but students at rival schools continued to vandalize it. It was moved to [[Maryland Stadium]] in 1951. In the 1960s, Testudo was moved back to a spot in front of McKeldin Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umd.edu/traditions/testudo/ |title=Traditions at The University of Maryland |publisher=Umd.edu |date=May 23, 1933 |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umd.edu/traditions/landmarks/ |title=Traditions at The University of Maryland |publisher=Umd.edu |date=September 24, 2003 |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/univarchives/macmil/testudo.html |title=Mac To Millennium: Testudo |publisher=Lib.umd.edu |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Rasmussen| first = Frederick| title = A stroke of good luck in Terps sculpture – Baltimore Sun| work = Baltimore Sun| accessdate =June 18, 2010| date = March 23, 2002| url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-03-23/features/0203230044_1_mckeldin-library-nose-university-of-maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 a duplicate statue was placed at Maryland Stadium, where the football team touch it for good luck as they pass by before games. Additional Testudo statues now sit outside of the Gossett Team House near the stadium; [[XFINITY Center (College Park, Maryland)|XFINITY Center]], the school's basketball arena; the Riggs Alumni Center; and in the lobby of the [[Adele H. Stamp Student Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; In 1994, the [[Maryland General Assembly]] approved legislation to name the diamondback terrapin (''malaclemys terrapin terrapin'') as the official state reptile and the legally codified mascot of the University of Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Maryland State Archives| title = Diamondback Terrapin, Maryland State Reptile| accessdate =June 18, 2010

University of Maryland|publisher=University of Maryland|url=http://www.feartheturtle.umd.edu/about/ |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070809225009/http://www.feartheturtle.umd.edu/about/ | archivedate = August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular Testudo statue lies in front of the McKeldin Library. The statue's nose is polished by passers-by that have rubbed it for good luck. Around finals week, students start giving offerings to Testudo in the hope of good grades. At that time, one can find Testudo weighted down with anything from trash to TVs to couches, all of which disappears by the next morning (with the help of cleaning staff). Some of the most unusual offerings have included a door, a light pole, a car, and a lighted Christmas tree.

In fall 2013, the Testudo statue caught fire because of an ill-advised mixture of offerings and a lit candle. Local news channels reported about this event and it trended on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/12/maryland-testudo-statue-fire-likely-not-intentional-authorities-say-98270.html|title=Maryland Testudo statue fire ruled accidental |work=WJLA |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
