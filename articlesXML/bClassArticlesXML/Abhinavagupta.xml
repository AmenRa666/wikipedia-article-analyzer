{{History of Kashmir}}
'''Abhinavagupta''' (c. 950 – 1016 AD&lt;ref&gt;Triadic Heart of Shiva, Paul E. Muller-Ortega, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Indian philosophy|philosopher]], [[Mysticism|mystic]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetician]] from [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abhinavagupta – the Philosopher|url=http://www.koausa.org/Glimpses/abhinava.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also considered an influential [[Music of India|musician]], [[Indian poetry|poet]], [[Theatre in India|dramatist]], [[exegesis|exegete]], theologian, and [[Indian logic|logician]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta page 4&quot;&gt;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Key to the Vedas, Nathalia Mikhailova, page 169&lt;/ref&gt; – a [[polymath]]ic personality who exercised strong influences on [[Indian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;The Pratyabhijñā Philosophy, Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Companion to Tantra, S.C. Banerji, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine of Divine Recognition, K. C. Pandey, page V&lt;/ref&gt; in a family of scholars and mystics and studied all the schools of philosophy and art of his time under the guidance of as many as fifteen (or more) teachers and [[guru]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 35&lt;/ref&gt; In his long life he completed over 35 works, the largest and most famous of which is ''[[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]]'', an encyclopaedic treatise on all the philosophical and practical aspects of [[Trika]] and [[Kaula]] (known today as [[Kashmir Shaivism]]). Another one of his very important contributions was in the field of philosophy of aesthetics with his famous ''[[Abhinavabharati|Abhinavabhāratī]]'' commentary of ''[[Natya Shastra|Nāṭyaśāstra]]'' of [[Bharata Muni]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page LXXVII&lt;/ref&gt;

Abhinavagupta's thought was strongly influenced by Buddhist logic.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Padoux. ''Vac: The Concept of the Word In Selected Hindu Tantras''. SUNY Press, 1990. page 180 &quot;One knows that the thought of such authors as Abhinavagupta was strongly influenced by Buddhist logic.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
&quot;Abhinavagupta&quot; was not his real name, rather a title he earned from his master, carrying a meaning of &quot;competence and authoritativeness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20&quot;&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir; Navjivan Rastogi, page 157&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis, Jayaratha (1150–1200 AD)&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 92&lt;/ref&gt; – who was Abhinavagupta's most important commentator – also reveals three more meanings: &quot;being ever vigilant&quot;, &quot;being present everywhere&quot; and &quot;protected by praises&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Kula Ritual page 4&quot;&gt;The Kula Ritual, As Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta; John R. Dupuche, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Raniero Gnoli, the only [[Sanskrit]] scholar who completed a translation of [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]] in a European language, mentions that &quot;Abhinava&quot; also means &quot;new&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, 1999, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; as a reference to the ever-new creative force of his mystical experience.

From Jayaratha, we learn that Abhinavagupta was in possession of all the six qualities required for the recipients of the tremendous level of [[Shaktipat|śaktipāta]], as described in the sacred texts (Śrīpūrvaśāstra):&lt;ref name=&quot;Abhinavagupta, Ganesh Tryambak Deshpande page 19&quot;&gt;Abhinavagupta, Ganesh Tryambak Deshpande, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; an unflinching faith in God, realisation of [[mantra]]s, control over objective principles (referring to [[the 36 tattvas]]), successful conclusion of all the activities undertaken, poetic creativity and spontaneous knowledge of all disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Abhinavagupta's creation is well equilibrated between the branches of the triad ([[Trika]]): will (''icchā''), knowledge (''[[Jnana|jñāna]]''), action (''[[Kriya|kriyā]]''); his works also include devotional songs, academical/philosophical works&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20&quot; /&gt; and works describing ritual/yogic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

As an author he is considered a systematiser of the philosophical thought. He reconstructed, rationalised and orchestrated the philosophical knowledge into a more coherent form,&lt;ref&gt;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; assessing all the available sources of his time, not unlike a modern scientific researcher of [[Indology]].

Various contemporary scholars have characterised Abhinavagupta as a &quot;brilliant scholar and saint&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Utpaladeva page XXXIII&quot;&gt;Īśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā of Utpaladeva, Verses on the Recognition of the Lord; B. N. Pandit, page XXXIII&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the pinnacle of the development of Kasmir Śaivism&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Utpaladeva page XXXIII&quot; /&gt; and &quot;in possession of yogic realization&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20&quot; /&gt;

==Social background, family and disciples==

===&quot;Magical&quot; birth===
The term by which Abhinavagupta himself defines his origin is &quot;yoginībhū&quot;, 'born of a [[Yogini|yoginī]]'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; In Kashmir Shaivism and especially in Kaula it is considered that a progeny of parents &quot;established in the divine essence of [[Bhairava]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta, Navjivan Rastogi, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; is endowed with exceptional spiritual and intellectual prowess. Such a child is supposed to be &quot;the depository of knowledge&quot;, who &quot;even as a child in the womb, has the form of [[Shiva]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Kula Ritual page 4&quot; /&gt; to enumerate but a few of the classical attributes of his kind.

===Parents===
His mother, ''Vimalā'' (''Vimalakalā'') died when Abhinavagupta was just two years old;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantra, Tantrāloka page 4&quot;&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; as a consequence of losing his mother, of whom he was reportedly very attached,&lt;ref name=&quot;Abhinavagupta, Ganesh Tryambak Deshpande page 19&quot;/&gt; he grew more distant from worldly life and focused all the more on spiritual endeavour.

The father, ''Narasiṃha Gupta'', after his wife's death favoured an ascetic lifestyle, while raising his three children. He had a cultivated mind and a heart &quot;outstandingly adorned with devotion to Mahesvara (Shiva)&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantra, Tantrāloka page 4&quot;/&gt; (in Abhinavagupta's own words). He was Abhinavagupta's first teacher, instructing him in [[Sanskrit grammar|grammar]], [[Indian logic|logic]] and [[Sanskrit literature|literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===

Abhinavagupta had a brother and a sister. The brother, ''Manoratha'', was a well versed devotee of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 22&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, ''Ambā'' (probable name, according to Navjivan Rastorgi), devoted herself to worship after the death of her husband in late life.

His cousin ''Karṇa'' demonstrated even from his youth that he grasped the essence of Śaivism and was detached of the world. His wife was presumably Abhinavagupta's older sister ''Ambā'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 24&quot;&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 24&lt;/ref&gt; who looked with reverence upon her illustrious brother. ''Ambā'' and ''Karṇa'' had a son, ''Yogeśvaridatta'', who was precociously talented in yoga&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; (''yogeśvar'' implies &quot;lord of yoga&quot;).

Abhinavagupta also mentions his disciple ''Rāmadeva'' as faithfully devoted to scriptural study and serving his master.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 24&quot;/&gt; Another cousin was ''Kṣema'', possibly the same as Abhinavagupta's illustrious disciple ''Kṣemarāja''. ''Mandra'', a childhood friend of ''Karṇa'', was their host in a suburban residence; he was not only rich and in possession of a pleasing personality, but also equally learned.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; And last but not least, ''Vatasikā'', ''Mandra'''s aunt, who got a special mention from Abhinavagupta for caring for him with exceptional dedication and concern; to express his gratitude, Abhinavagupta declared that ''Vatasikā'' deserved the credit for the successful completion of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging picture here is that Abhinavagupta lived in a nurturing and protected environment, where his creative energies got all the support they required. Everyone around him was filled with spiritual fervor and had taken Abhinavagupta as their spiritual master. Such a supporting group of family and friends was equally necessary as his personal qualities of genius, to complete a work of the magnitude of [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]].

===Ancestors===
By Abhinavagupta's own account, his most remote known ancestor was called ''Atrigupta'', born in ''Madhyadeśa'': [Manusmirti (circa 1500 BC, 2/21) defines the Madhyadesh region as vast plains between Himalaya and Vindhya mountains and to the east of the river Vinasana (invisible Saraswati) and to the west of Praya]. Born in Madhyadeśa he travelled to [[Kashmir]] at the request of the king [[Lalitaditya Muktapida|Lalitāditya]],&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Kula Ritual, As Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta; John R. Dupuche, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; around year 740 CE .&lt;ref name=&quot;Triadic Mysticism page 12&quot;&gt;Triadic Mysticism, Paul E. Murphy, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masters==
Abhinavagupta is famous for his voracious thirst of knowledge. To study he took many teachers (as many as 15, or even more!),&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; both mystical philosophers and scholars. He approached [[Vaishnavism|Vaiṣṇavas]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Śiddhānta Śaivists]] and the [[Trika]] scholars.

Among the most prominent of his teachers he enumerates four. ''Vāmanātha'' who instructed him in dualistic ''Śaivism''&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 54&quot;&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bhūtirāja'' in the dualist/nondualist school. Besides being the teacher of the famous Abhinavagupta, ''Bhūtirāja'' was also the father of two eminent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lakṣmasṇagupta'', a direct disciple of [[Somananda|Somānanda]], in the lineage of ''Trayambaka'', was highly respected by Abhinavagupta and taught him all the schools of monistic thought : ''Krama'', [[Trika]] and ''Pratyabhijña'' (except [[Kaula|Kula]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 54&quot;/&gt;

''Śambhunātha'' taught him the fourth school (''Ardha-trayambaka''). This school is in fact Kaula, and it was emanated from ''Trayambaka'''s daughter.

For Abhinavagupta, ''Śambhunātha'' was the most admired guru. Describing the greatness of his master, he compared ''Śambhunātha'' with the Sun, in his power to dispel ignorance from the heart, and, in another place, with &quot;the Moon shining over the ocean of ''Trika'' knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Kula Ritual page 7&quot;&gt;The Kula Ritual, As Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta; John R. Dupuche, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Abhinavagupta received Kaula initiation through ''Śambhunātha'''s wife (acting as a ''dūtī'' or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]]). The energy of this initiation is transmitted and sublimated into the heart and finally into consciousness. Such a method is difficult but very rapid and is reserved for those who shed their mental limitations and are pure.

It was ''Śambhunātha'' who requested of him to write [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]]. As guru, he had a profound influence in the structure of [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]]&lt;ref&gt;The Triadic Heart of Śiva, Kaula Tantricism of Abhinavagupta in the Non-Dual Shaivism of Kashmir; Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; and in the life of its creator, Abhinavagupta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 44-54&quot;&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 44-54&lt;/ref&gt;

As many as twelve more of his principal teachers are enumerated by name but without details.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 35,54&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Abhinavagupta had more secondary teachers. Moreover, during his life he had accumulated a large number of texts from which he quoted in his magnum opus, in his desire to create a synthetic, all inclusive system, where the contrasts of different scriptures could be resolved by integration into a superior perspective.

==Lifestyle==
Abhinavagupta remained unmarried all his life,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; we do however know him to be an adept of [[Kaula]] and as such, used his energy (ojas) as a vital force, a constant source of shakti to power the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works. This system involves ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and shakti, yet this union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus for a master such as Abhinavagupta, he was always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. We can only speculate about whether he was physically chaste, and either answer to this question is not very meaningful in the context of his life and teachings. Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.

He studied assiduously at least until the age of 30 or 35,&lt;ref name=&quot;Triadic Mysticism page 12&quot;/&gt; and to do that he travelled, but mostly inside Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;The Kula Ritual, As Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta; John R. Dupuche, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

By his own testimony, he had attained spiritual liberation through his ''Kaula'' practice, under the guidance of his most admired master, ''Śambhunātha''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 44-54&quot;/&gt;

He lived in his home (functioning as an [[ashram]]) with his family members and disciples&lt;ref&gt;Īśvara Pratyabhijñā Kārikā of Utpaladeva, Verses on the Recognition of the Lord; B. N. Pandit, page XXXIV&lt;/ref&gt; and he did not become a wandering monk, nor did he take on the regular duties of his family.

Thus, Abhinavagupta lived out his life as a writer and a teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Kula Ritual page 7&quot;/&gt; His personality was a living realisation of his vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Re-accessing Abhinavagupta page 4&quot; /&gt;

In an epoch pen-painting he is depicted seated in ''Virasana'', surrounded by devoted disciples and family, performing a kind of trance inducing music at [[veena]] while dictating verses of [[Tantrāloka]] to one of his attendees – behind him two ''dūtī'' (women [[yogi]]) waiting on him.

A legend about the moment of his death (placed somewhere between 1015 and 1025 depending on the source), says that he took with him 1200 disciples and marched off to a cave (the [[Bhairava]] Cave, an actual place known to this day), reciting his poem ''Bhairava-stava'', a devotional work. They were never to be seen again, supposedly translating together in the spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;Triadic Mysticism, Paul E. Murphy, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[Image:Trident Yantra of Parama Siva.jpg|thumb|The trident (''triśūlābija maṇḍalam''), symbol and yantra of Parama Shiva, representing the triadic energies of ''parā'', ''parā-aparā'' and ''aparā śakti'']]
{{Hinduism}}
Abhinavagupta's works fall into multiple sections: manuals of religious ritual, devotional songs, philosophical works and philosophy of aesthetics. Here are enumerated most of his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Bold type faced titles represent the most important ones.

===Religious works===

====Tantraloka====
{{main|Tantraloka}}
His most important work was ''Tantrāloka'',(translates into  &quot;To Throw Light on Tantra&quot;), a synthesis of all the Trika system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi page 20&quot; /&gt; Its only complete translation in a European language – Italian – is credited to [[Raniero Gnoli]], now at its second edition.&lt;ref&gt;Luce dei Tantra, Tantrāloka, Abhinavagupta, Raniero Gnoli, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The esoteric chapter 29 on the Kaula ritual was translated in English together with ''Jayaratha'''s commentary by John R. Dupuche, Rev. Dr.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Kula Ritual page 4&quot; /&gt; A complex study on the context, authors, contents and references of ''Tantrāloka'' was published by Navjivan Rastogi, Prof. of the Lucknow University.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the Tantrāloka, Navjivan Rastogi&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are no English translations of ''Tantrāloka'' to date, the last recognized master of the oral tradition of Kashmir Shaivism, [[Swami Lakshman Joo]], gave a condensed version of the important philosophical chapters of ‘‘Tantrāloka’‘ in his book, ''Kashmir Shaivism – The Secret Supreme''.&lt;ref&gt;Kashmir Shaivism – ''The Secret Supreme'', ed, John Hughes, SUNY press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important text was the commentary on Parātrīśikā, ''Parātrīśikāvivaraṇa'', detailing the signification of the phonematic energies and their two sequential ordering systems, Mātṛkā and Mālinī. This was the last great translation project of [[Jaideva Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;Para-trisika-Vivarana, Jaideva Singh&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tantrasara====
{{main|Tantrasara}}
Tantrasāra (&quot;Essence of Tantra&quot;) is a summarised version, in prose, of ''Tantrāloka'', which was once more summarised in ''Tantroccaya'', and finally presented in a very short summary form under the name of ''Tantravaṭadhānikā'' – the &quot;Seed of Tantra&quot;.

''Pūrvapañcikā'' was a commentary of ''Pūrvatantra'', alias Mālinīvijaya Tantra, lost to this day. ''Mālinīvijayā-varttika'' (&quot;Commentary on Mālinīvijaya&quot;) is a versified commentary on ''Mālinīvijaya Tantra'''s first verse. ''Kramakeli'', &quot;Krama's Play&quot; was a commentary of ''Kramastotra'', now lost. ''Bhagavadgītārtha-saṃgraha'' which translates &quot;Commentary on [[Bhagavad Gita]]&quot; has now an English translation by Boris Marjanovic.&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavagupta's Commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Boris Marjanovic&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religious works are: ''Parātrīśikā-laghuvṛtti'', &quot;A Short Commentary on Parātrīśikā&quot;, ''Paryantapañcāśīkā'' (&quot;Fifty Verses on the Ultimate Reality&quot;), ''Rahasyapañcadaśikā'' (&quot;Fifteen Verses on the Mystical Doctrine&quot;), ''Laghvī prakriyā'' (&quot;Short Ceremony&quot;), ''Devīstotravivaraṇa'' (&quot;Commentary on the Hymn to Devi&quot;) and ''Paramārthasāra'' (&quot;Essence of the Supreme Reality&quot;).

===Devotional hymns===
Abhinavagupta has composed a number of devotional poems, most of which have been translated into French by [[Lilian Silburn]]:&lt;ref&gt;Hymnes de Abhinavagupta: Traduits et commentés, Lilian Silburn&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Bodhapañcadaśikā'' – &quot;Fifteen Verses on Consciousness&quot;;
*''Paramārthacarcā'' – &quot;Discussion on the Supreme Reality&quot;;
*''Anubhavanivedana'' – &quot;Tribute of the Inner Experience&quot;;
*''Anuttarāṣṭikā'' – &quot;Eight Verses on [[Anuttara]]&quot;;
*''Krama-stotra'' – an hymn, different from the fundamental text of the [[Krama]] school;
*''Bhairava-stava'' – &quot;Hymn to [[Bhairava]]&quot;;
*''Dehasthadevatācakra-stotra'' – &quot;Hymn to the Wheel of Divinities that Live in the Body&quot;;
*''Paramārthadvādaśikā'' – &quot;Twelve Verses on the Supreme Reality&quot; and
*''Mahopadeśa-viṃśatikā'' – &quot;Twenty Verses on the Great Teaching&quot;.
*Another poem ''Śivaśaktyavinābhāva-stotra'' – &quot;Hymn on the Inseparability of [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]]&quot; was lost.

===Philosophical works===
One of the most important works of Abhinavagupta is ''Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vimarśini'' (&quot;Commentary to the Verses on the Recognition of the Lord&quot;) and ''Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vivṛti-vimarśini'' (&quot;Commentary on the explanation of ''Īśvarapratyabhijñā''&quot;). This treatise is fundamental in the transmission of the ''Pratyabhijña'' school (the branch of Kashmir Shaivism based on direct recognition of the Lord) to our days. Another commentary on a ''Pratyabhijña'' work – ''Śivadṛṣtyā-locana'' (&quot;Light on Śivadṛṣṭi&quot;) – is now lost. Another lost commentary is ''Padārthapraveśa-nirṇaya-ṭīkā'' and ''Prakīrṇkavivaraṇa'' (&quot;Comment on the Notebook&quot;) referring to the third chapter of ''Vākyapadīya'' of [[Bhartrihari]].

===Poetical and dramatic works===
{{main|Abhinavabharati}}
''Abhinavagupta'''s most important work on the philosophy of art is ''Abhinavabhāratī'' – a long and complex commentary on [[Natya Shastra]] of [[Bharata Muni]]. This work has been one of the most important factors contributing to Abhinavagupta's fame up until present day. His most important contribution was that to the theory of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]] (aesthetic savour).

Other poetical works include: ''Ghaṭa-karpara-kulaka-vivṛti'', a commentary on &quot;Ghaṭakarpara&quot; of [[Kalidasa]]; ''Kāvyakauṭukavivaraṇa'', a &quot;Commentary to the Wonder of Poetry&quot; (a work of Bhaṭṭa Tauta), now lost; and ''Dhvanyālokalocana'', &quot;Illustration of Dhvanyāloka&quot;, which is a famous work of [[Anandavardhana]].
