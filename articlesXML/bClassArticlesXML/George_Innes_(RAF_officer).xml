==Early life==
Innes was born on 26 November 1923 at [[Musselburgh]], [[East Lothian]] and educated at Crookston School in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11492443/Air-Commodore-George-Innes-obituary.html  Telegraph Obituary - George Innes CBE MBIM]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime service==
He was called up for service at the end of 1943 as [[Aircraftman]] 2nd class (service number 1570346) and became a student pilot, training at [[Weeton Barracks|RAF Weeton]] and on the [[Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-air-commodore-george-innes-cbe-1-3732544 The Scotsman - Obituary - George Innes]&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned as [[pilot officer]] on 31 March 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37124|supp=yes|startpage=3077|date=8 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innes gained his pilot's [[aircrew brevet]] wings just as hostilities ended in Europe. On 1 October 1945 he was promoted [[flying officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=37333|supp=yes|startpage=5338|date=30 October 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On discharge from wartime service he joined the [[City of Edinburgh Police|City of Edinburgh police force]], serving as a police constable until his application for a commission in the Provost and Security Branch of the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11492443/Air-Commodore-George-Innes-obituary.html  Telegraph Obituary - George Innes CBE MBIM]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Far East===
In January 1946 he was in command of the [[RAF Police]] in [[Bangkok]] following the assassination of King Ramas VIII [[Ananda Mahidol]]. Innes accomplished the safe extraction of the new King Ramas IX [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] using an [[RAF]] transport aircraft before he could suffer a similar fate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/life-style/obituaries/obituary-george-innes-91-1-3733915   Edinburgh News Obituary - G Innes CBE]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as an acting [[flying officer]]. Shortly afterwards the RAF moved out of Thailand and he set up the regional HQ of the [[Special Investigation Branch#Royal Air Force Police SIB|Special Investigation Branch]] of the [[RAF Police]] in Rangoon. Until 20 February 1947 Innes held the appointment of Assistant to the Provost Marshal,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=38338|supp=yes|startpage=3783|date=25 June 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  later proving himself successful in Hong Kong and Singapore. For some time he was in charge of training RAF police dogs at [[RAF Netheravon]], Wiltshire. On 7 May 1951 Innes was appointed an Assistant to the Provost Marshal.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39445|supp=yes|startpage=453|date=18 January 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 March 1951 he was promoted to full [[Flying Officer]] on a short service commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39209|supp=yes|startpage=2314|date=20 April 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was updated on 1 April 1952 to a permanent regular commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39784|supp=yes|startpage=1093|date=20 February 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then on 1 January 1953 he was promoted [[flight lieutenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=39739|supp=yes|startpage=56|date=30 December 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermo nuclear Tests===
Innes specialised in criminal investigations and counterintelligence, and was appointed security officer for Task Force Grapple, participating in [[Operation Grapple]] – the British thermonuclear tests conducted at [[Kiritimati]], [[Christmas Island]] – in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11492443/Air-Commodore-George-Innes-obituary.html  Telegraph Obituary - George Innes CBE MBIM]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterintelligence===
[[File:CBEwithMilitaryRibbon.jpg|thumb|305px|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]]
In 1963 Innes was one for two [[RAF]] officers appointed to supervise the creation of the RAF Security Directorate to review internal security. This followed a high-profile inquiry headed by [[Lord Denning MR|Lord Denning]] into the [[Portland Spy Ring]], which resulted in the conviction of  five people who had been spying within the [[Royal Navy]] for the Soviets. On 1 January 1966 Innes was promoted [[squadron leader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=41915|supp=yes|startpage=70|date=29 December 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In February 1968 [[MI5]] received a tip that an RAF serviceman was offering information to the Soviet [[GRU]] intelligence service and after initial case work was completed, in July the RAF became involved. As head of RAF counterintelligence, Innes led the hunt and identified [[Chief Technician]] Douglas Britten (born 31 October 1931, died Feb 1990), an RAF signals intelligence specialist serving at No. 399 Signals Unit at [[RAF Digby]] and also at a listening station in [[Cyprus]] which cooperated with [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-air-commodore-george-innes-cbe-1-3732544  The Scotsman - Obituary - George Innes]&lt;/ref&gt; Innes’s team arrested Britten on 13 September 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V-ZVcsl0h3EC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=%22Douglas+britten%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=otI55BJVVB&amp;sig=VArF9Ms5zXOOxL0NHwiARmx_Fp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR2Yyb1YHKAhUBHx4KHY3SDXkQ6AEIUzAK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Douglas%20britten%22&amp;f=false  Encyclopaedia of Cold War Spies - Douglas Britten]&lt;/ref&gt; Searches of Britten’s home and other locations yielded spying equipment including some supplied by the Soviet Intelligence Service. Britten confessed and stood trial at the [[Central Criminal Court]], receiving a sentence of 21 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kissack.co.uk/index.php?page=britten-arrested-for-spying  Kissack - Arrest of Britten]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1968/11/05/page/44/article/british-airman-sentenced-as-spy-for-soviet  Chicago Tribune 5 November 1968 - Britten sentenced]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, London.  Document PREM 13/2381&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1974 Innes was promoted [[group captain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=46174|supp=yes|startpage=286|date=7 January 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RAF Provost Marshal===
In 1976 Innes was appointed an [[Aide-de-camp#United Kingdom|ADC]] to the Queen, and on 27 February appointed RAF [[Provost marshal|Provost Marshal,]] the highest post within the [[RAF Police]],&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=46889|supp=yes|startpage=6387|date=3 May 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; quickly being promoted to [[Air Commodore]] on 1 July 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=46953|supp=yes|startpage=9292|date=5 July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Innes held the position until 13 May 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=47545|supp=yes|startpage=6557|date=26 May 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired on 1 July 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=47609|supp=yes|startpage=9492|date=7 August 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
