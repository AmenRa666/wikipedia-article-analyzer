'''''Virology''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] in [[virology]]. Established in 1955 by [[George Hirst (virologist)|George Hirst]], [[Lindsay Black]] and [[Salvador Luria]], it is the earliest English-only journal to specialise in the field. The journal covers basic research into [[virus]]es affecting [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]], including their [[molecular biology]], structure, assembly, [[pathogenesis]], [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], interactions with the host cell, [[viral evolution|evolution]] and [[ecology]]. Molecular aspects of control and prevention are also covered, as well as [[viral vector]]s and [[gene therapy]], but [[clinical virology]] is excluded.&lt;ref name=guide /&gt; As of 2013, the journal is published fortnightly by [[Elsevier]].

==History==
The field of virology began in the 1890s, with the discovery of infectious agents small enough to pass through filters sufficiently fine to catch bacteria.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt; The first specialist journal in the field, ''[[Archives of Virology|Archiv für die gesamte Virusforschung]]'', appeared in 1939. Published by [[Springer-Verlag]] out of its [[Vienna]] office, its papers were in a mixture of languages, mainly German, French and English, and as the [[Second World War]] continued, publication became erratic.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog?term=%22Arch+Gesamte+Virusforsch%22 National Library of Medicine: NLM catalog: ''Archiv für die gesamte Virusforschung''] (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/705 SpringerLink: ''Archives of Virology'': All Volumes &amp; Issues] (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Helvoort T. When did virology start? ''ASM News'' 62: 142–145&lt;/ref&gt; Most research continued to be published in non-specialist scientific and medical journals, with the research communities studying the viruses of animals, plants and bacteria remaining separated from one another.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirst_1962&gt;[[George Hirst (virologist)|Hirst GK]]. (1962) Development of virology as an independent science. ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' 26 May: 1431–1437 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1958569/pdf/brmedj02869-0023.pdf pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Hirst (virologist)|George Hirst]], [[Lindsay Black]] and [[Salvador Luria]] saw the need for a journal that united basic science research across all viruses, regardless of their host species.&lt;ref name=Schlesinger&gt;[[R. Walter Schlesinger|Schlesinger RW]], [[Allan Granoff|Granoff A]] (1994) &quot;George K. Hirst (1909–1994)&quot; ''Virology'' 200: 327&lt;/ref&gt; They established ''Virology'' in 1955, and the journal first appeared in May of that year.&lt;ref name=Joklik&gt;[[Wolfgang Joklik|Joklik WK]]. (1999) When two is better than one: Thoughts on three decades of interaction between ''Virology'' and the ''Journal of Virology''. ''[[Journal of Virology|J Virol]]'' 73: 3520–3523 ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC104123/ text])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Emerman&gt;[http://www.journals.elsevier.com/virology/journal-news/michael-emerman-named-editor-in-chief-of-virology/ Elsevier: Michael Emerman named editor-in-chief of ''Virology''] (accessed 17 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=issue1&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00426822/1/1 Science Direct: ''Virology'' Volume 1, Issue 1, Pages 1-139 (May 1955)] (accessed 17 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first English-only journal to focus on virology,&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt; and is the oldest United States-based journal in the specialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhcrc.org/en/news/center-news/2013/1/michael-emerman-virology-editor-in-chief.html Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center: Michael Emerman: Virology's new editor-in-chief] (accessed 17 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Hirst was the founding editor-in-chief, with Black and Luria being co-editors.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt; Between them, they covered the major disciplines of viruses infecting animals (Hirst), plants (Black) and bacteria (Luria).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/26/obituaries/george-keble-hirst-84-is-dead-a-pioneer-in-molecular-virology.html George Keble Hirst, 84, is dead; a pioneer in molecular virology. ''New York Times'' (26 January 1994)] (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Black&gt;Brakke MK, Reddy DVR. (1998) Lindsay M. Black, 1907 to 1997. ''[[Phytopathology (journal)|Phytopathology]]'' 88: 872 ([http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHYTO.1998.88.9.872 pdf]) (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Collection/CID/QL National Library of Medicine: Profiles in Science: The Salvador E. Luria Papers] (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike several other long-established general journals in the field, such as the ''[[Journal of Virology]]'' from the [[American Society for Microbiology]] and the [[Society for General Microbiology]]'s ''[[Journal of General Virology]]'' (which both first appeared in 1967), ''Virology'' is a commercial journal which has never been associated with an [[academic society]].&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wagner /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Postgate_TIM&quot;&gt;{{citation |author=Postgate J |title=Fifty years of the SGM |journal=[[Trends in Microbiology]] |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=249–50 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7551634 |doi=10.1016/S0966-842X(00)88935-0 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0966-842X(00)88935-0 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally published by [[Academic Press]], and then under the Academic Press imprints of purchasers [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt, Brace &amp; World]] and Elsevier.&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;Wagner RR. (1999) The ''Journal of Virology'': a Personal Retrospective. ''J Virol'' 73: 3515–3519 ([http://jvi.asm.org/content/73/5/3515.long text])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NLM&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/110674 National Library of Medicine: NLM catalogue: ''Virology''] (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal was soon successful. [[Robert Wagner (virologist)|Robert Wagner]], founding editor of the ''Journal of Virology'', describes ''Virology'' in the mid-1960s as &quot;the well-established Academic Press journal ''Virology'', which had an excellent reputation and to which many virus researchers, including myself, submitted their very best papers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wagner /&gt; Seven issues in two volumes were published in the initial year, with a total of 538 pages. In 1959, the frequency increased to monthly, with three annual volumes, and the journal had nearly quadrupled in size by its sixth year.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt;&lt;ref name=contents /&gt; The frequency increased to 14 issues per year in 1976, returning to monthly in 1987, and then increasing again over 1994–95 to reach twice monthly in 1996.&lt;ref name=contents&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00426822/ Science Direct: ''Virology'' Contents] (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue contained a broad mix of research including papers on [[bacteriophage]]s, the [[plant virus]]es, [[tobacco mosaic virus|tobacco mosaic]] and [[potato virus X]], and the [[animal virus]]es, [[influenza virus|influenza]], [[Rift Valley fever virus|Rift Valley fever]] and [[poliovirus]]. Authors included [[Renato Dulbecco]], [[Alfred Hershey]], [[Raymond Latarjet]], [[André Michel Lwoff]] and [[Marguerite Vogt]], among others. The journal had an international authorship from the start, with authors from the United States and France, two major centres of phage research at that date, as well as Japan.&lt;ref name=issue1 /&gt; The early content was biased towards [[virus structure]] and [[viral life cycle|replication]], which made up two-thirds of the content in the mid-1960s, but have gradually been replaced by research into [[pathogenesis]], [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] and interactions with the host cell, which made up more than two-thirds of the journal in 1999.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt; The early journal was particularly known for publishing research into plant viruses. Wagner writes &quot;our competitor, ''Virology'', had emphasized plant viruses to such a degree that this area had become a paramount part of their publishing effort and most plant virologists looked upon ''Virology'' as their journal.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wagner /&gt; This focus changed over time, and by 1999, animal viruses were the subject of over 88% of the journal's content.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt;

[[File:Salvador E. Luria ca.1969.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Salvador Luria]], one of ''Virology''{{'}}s founders]]
Hirst served as editor-in-chief for 21 years until 1975, and his influence on the journal was enormous. When he retired, his co-editors wrote that &quot;he has defined the journal's objectives and established its style.&quot;&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt; Hirst has had only three successors:&lt;ref name=Emerman /&gt; [[Wolfgang Joklik]] served for 18 years (1975–1994) and was succeeded by [[Robert A. Lamb]] (1994–2012).&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/lamb/cv.html Northwestern University: Lamb Laboratory: Curriculum Vitae: Robert Andrew Lamb] (accessed 17 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The present editor-in-chief, [[Michael Emerman]] ([[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], Seattle, USA), took over in January 2013.&lt;ref name=Emerman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.elsevier.com/virology/editorial-board/ Elsevier: ''Virology'' Editorial Board] (accessed 17 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Of Hirst's co-founders, Luria, the well-known phage researcher, remained a co-editor for 18 years; Black was the plant virus editor until 1965.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Black /&gt; Another well-known co-editor was [[Arnold J. Levine]] (1975–1984), who left ''Virology'' to become editor-in-chief of the ''Journal of Virology''.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt;

==Modern journal==
Papers are accepted on all viruses, irrespective of host species, but the modern journal's primary focus is on animal viruses.&lt;ref name=Joklik /&gt; The journal content is divided by topic, rather than by type of virus.&lt;ref name=guide /&gt; The journal publishes occasional special issues, including reviews-only issues in 2011 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.elsevier.com/virology/special-issues/ Elsevier: ''Virology'': Special Issues] (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; From January 2013, recent content is available freely online after 12 months, with immediate free access to reviews and special issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.elsevier.com/virology/ Elsevier: ''Virology'': Index] (accessed 17 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.elsevier.com/virology/journal-news/publish-in-virology-with-no-page-charges/ Elsevier: Open up your research: publish in ''Virology''] (accessed 17 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Virology'' also participates in a [[Hybrid open-access journal|hybrid open-access]] scheme, so that authors can pay for articles to be available online without delay.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/journals/virology/0042-6822/guide-for-authors Elsevier: ''Virology'': Guide for Authors] (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstracting and indexing==
''Virology'' has a 2011 [[impact factor]] of 3.351, according to ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]''.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2012 |chapter=Virology |title=2011 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |accessdate=2012-11-21 |series=[[Web of Science]] |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is abstracted and indexed in:&lt;ref name=NLM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/journals/virology/0042-6822/abstracting-indexing Elsevier: ''Virology'': Abstracting and Indexing] (accessed 18 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
