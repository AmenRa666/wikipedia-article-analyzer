Historically, there has been an [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] tendency to emphasize the study of animal [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]] as models for human mental illnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen, J. B. 2001&quot;&gt;Owen, J. B., Treasure, J.L. &amp; Collier, D.A. 2001. Animal Models- Disorders of Eating Behaviour and Body Composition. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell; Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; But animal psychopathologies can, from an [[evolution]]ary point of view, be more properly regarded as non-adaptive behaviors due to some sort of a [[cognitive disability]], emotional impairment or distress. This article provides a non-exhaustive list of animal psychopathologies.

==Eating disorders==
Animals in the wild appear to be relatively free from [[eating disorders]] although their body composition fluctuates depending on seasonal and [[reproductive cycle]]s. However, [[domesticated]] animals including [[farm animals|farm]], [[Laboratory animal|laboratory]] and [[pets|pet animals]] are prone to disorders. [[Evolutionary fitness]] drives [[feeding behavior]] in [[wild animals]]. The expectation is that farm animals also display this behavior, but questions arise if the same principles apply to laboratory and pet animals.

===Activity anorexia===
'''Activity anorexia''' (AA) is a condition where [[rat]]s begin to exercise excessively while simultaneously cutting down on their food intake, similar to human [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[hypergymnasia]]. When given free access to food and an exercise wheel, rats normally develop a balanced routine between exercise and food intake, which turns them into fit rats. However, if food intake is restricted and wheel access is unrestricted, rats begin to exercise more and eat less, resulting in excessive weight loss and, ultimately, death. The running cycles shift so that most of the running is done in hours before feeding is scheduled. In other conditions, AA does not develop. Unrestricted food access and restricted wheel access will not cause any significant change in either feeding or exercise routine. Also, if rats are restricted both in food intake and wheel access, they will adjust accordingly. In fact, if rats are first trained to the feeding schedule and then given unrestricted access to a running wheel, they will not develop AA behavior. Results support the notion that the running interferes with [[adaptive behavior|adaptation]] to the new feeding schedule and is associated with the [[reward system]] in the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12642171&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Laboratory rats therefore run (forage) more in response to food shortages.  The effect of semi-[[starvation]] on activity has also been studied in [[primates]]. [[Rhesus macaque]] males become hyperactive in response to long-term chronic food restriction.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12818707&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Thin sow syndrome===
'''Thin Sow Syndrome''' (TSS) is a behavior observed in [[domestic pig|stalled sows]] that is similar to AA where some sows after early [[pregnancy]] are extremely active, eat little and waste away resulting very often in death. They suffer from [[emaciation]], [[hypothermia]], a depraved appetite, restlessness and hyperactivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12818707&quot; /&gt;  The syndrome may mainly be related to social and environmental [[stressors]]. Studies on the effects of [[overcrowding]] were pioneered by John B. Calhoun in the 1940s by placing pregnant Norway rats in a room with plenty of water and food and observing the [[population growth]].  The population reached a number of individuals and did not grow after; overcrowding produced stress and psychopathologies. Even though there was plenty of water and food the rats stop eating and stop reproducing.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid670891&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|pmid= 670891
|doi=10.1037/0097-7403.4.2.188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These effects have also been observed in jam-packed [[beetles]]. When overcrowding occurs female beetles destroy their eggs and turn [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]], eating each other. Male beetles lose interest in the females and although there is plenty of water and food there is no population growth. Similar effects have been observed in overcrowded situations in [[hare|jack rabbits]] in [[Minnesota]], and [[deer]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine website in the Health and Science section. A Self-Corrective for The Population Explosion? Published Feb. 28, 1964. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873834-1,00.html
&lt;/ref&gt;  Stress in stalled sows is often perceived as the consequence of the restraint of animals that happens in [[intensive pig farming|intensive production units]]. The sows that suffer the most restraining conditions are those [[lactation|lactating]] or pregnant as they have very little room to move around because they are kept in barred [[gestation crate]]s or tethered for the 16 weeks of pregnancy which prevents natural and social behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Radostits, O.M. 2000. Veterinary Medicine: A Textbook of the Diseases of Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Goats and Horses. Saunders Ltd.; 9th edition, pp. 1767.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, increased movement and freedom is also stressful for adult sows, which is usually the case after [[weaning]]. When placed into groups they fight vigorously with one dominant sow emerging that eats greedily and becomes large and fat. It is also very likely that two subservient sows make up part of the group who actively avoid competitive feeding situations and are bullied around by the dominant sow. Affected sows have poor appetite but often show PICA and excessive water intake and are anemic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owen, J. B. 2001&quot; /&gt;

===Pica===
'''[[Pica (disorder)|Pica]]''' is the ingestion of non-nutritive substances and has so far been poorly documented. In non-human animals in the laboratory it has been examined through the ingestion of [[kaolin]] (a clay mineral) by rats. Rats were induced to intake kaolin by administering various [[vomiting#emetics|emetic stimuli]] such as [[copper sulfate]], [[apomorphine]], [[cisplatin]], and motion. Rats are unable to vomit when they ingest a substance that is harmful thus pica in rats is analogous to vomiting in other species; it is a way for rats to relieve digestive distress.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11488439&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1254/jjp.86.359}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some animals pica seems to be an adaptive trait but in others it seems to be a true psychopathology like in the case of some [[chickens]]. Chickens can display a type of pica when they are feed-deprived (feeding restriction has been adopted by the egg industry to [[forced molting|induce molting]]).  They increase their non-nutritive pecking, such as pecking structural features of their environment like wood or wire on fences or the feathers of other birds. It is a typical response that occurs when feeding is restricted or is completely withdrawn. Some of the non-nutritive pecking may be due to a redirection of foraging related behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, A. B., 2003. Physiology and behavior of the hen during induced molt. Poultry Science, 82, 992-1002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another animal that has displayed a more complex pica example are [[cattle]]. Cattle eat bones when they have a [[phosphorus deficiency]]. However, in some cases they persist on eating bones even after their phosphorus levels have stabilized and they are getting adequate doses of phosphorus in their diet. In this case evidence supports both a physical and psychological adaptive response. Cattle that continue to eat bones after their phosphorus levels are adequate do it because of a psychological [[reinforcer]]. &quot;The persistence of pica in the seeming absence of a physiological cause might be due to the fortuitous acquisition of a conditioned illness during the period of physiological insult.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid563606&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|pages= 401–12
|pmid= 563606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cat]]s also display pica behavior in their natural environments and there is evidence to support that this behavior has a psychological aspect to it. Some breeds (such as the [[Siamese cat]]) are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica. Cats have been observed to start by chewing and sucking on non-nutritive substances like wool, cotton, rubber, plastic and even [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] and then progress into ingestion of these substances. This type of behavior occurs through the first four years of a cat's life but it is primarily observed during the first two months of life when cats are introduced into new homes is most common.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw, J.W.S. 1997. pp. 373-379&quot;&gt;Bradshaw, J.W.S., Neville, P.F. &amp; Sawyer, D. 1997. Factors affecting pica in the domestic cat. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 52(3-4), pp. 373-379.&lt;/ref&gt;  Theories explaining why this behavior becomes active during this time suggest that early [[weaning]] and stress as a consequence of separation from the mother and litter-mates and exposure to a new environment are to blame. Eating wool or other substances may be a soothing mechanism that cats develops to [[coping (psychology)|cope]] with the changes. Pica is also observed predominately during 6–8 months of a cat's life when [[Territoriality|territorial]] and sexual behaviors emerge. Pica may be induced by these social stressors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw, J.W.S. 1997. pp. 373-379&quot; /&gt;  Other theories contemplated include pica as a redirection of [[predation|prey-catching/ingestion]] behavior as a result of indoor confinement, especially common among oriental breeds due to risk of theft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw, J.W.S. 1997. pp. 373-379&quot; /&gt;  In natural environments pica has been observed in [[parrots]] (such as [[macaws]]) and other birds and mammals. Charles Munn has been studying Amazon macaws lick clay from riverbeds in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] to [[detoxify]] the seeds they eat. Amazon macaws spend two to three hours a day licking clay.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, J.2005. Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach. Sinaur Associates, Inc; 8th Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Munn has found that clay helps counter the [[tannin]] and [[alkaloid]] in the seeds the macaws ingest, a strategy that is also used by native cultures in the [[Andes Mountains]] in [[Peru]].

Pica also affects domesticated animals.  While drugs like [[Prozac]] are often able to diminish troublesome behaviors in pet [[dog]]s, they don't seem to help with this eating disorder.  The following story about Bumbley, a [[wire fox terrier]] who appeared on ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]''{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} as a result of his eating disorder, is taken from a book by Dr. Nicholas Dodman.

:&quot;''This dog's presenting problem was light chasing (otherwise known as shadow chasing).  It chased shadows for hours on end, even excavating through plasterboard walls to pursue its [[will-o'-the-wisp]] illusions...The one thing that didn't come across clearly in the show was that Bumbley ate everything in sight and the house had to be &quot;Bumbley-proofed&quot; against his relentless ingestion of anything his owners left around...He had already had surgery to relieve intestinal obstructions resulting from his habit and, each day, his owners reentered their house with trepidation after work, fearing that Bumbley might have eaten something else''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dodman, Nicholas. 1999. Dogs Behaving Badly: An A-to-Z Guide to Understanding &amp; Curing Behavioral Problems in Dogs. Bantam Books: New York. pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodman talks about new research relating [[bulimia]] and [[compulsive overeating]] to [[seizure|seizural]] behavior in human patients.  He suggests that anti-epileptic medication might be a possible treatment for some cases of pica in animals.

==Behavioral disorders==
Behavioral disorders are difficult to study in [[animal models]] because it is difficult to know what animals are thinking and because animal models used to assess psychopathologies are experimental preparations developed to study a condition. Can a [[monkey]] effectively communicate that he is sad or that he feels overwhelmed? Lacking the ability to use [[language]] to study behavioral disorders like [[depression (mood)|depression]] and stress questions the validity of those studies conducted. It can be difficult to attribute human afflictions to non-human animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22158981&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)===
'''Obsessive compulsive behavior''' in animals can be defined as a specific, unnecessary action (or series of actions) repeated more often than would normally be expected.  It is unknown whether animals are able to 'obsess' in the same way as humans, and because the motivation for compulsive acts in non-human animals is  unknown, the term &quot;abnormal repetitive behaviour&quot; is less misleading.

A wide variety of animals exhibit behaviors that can be considered abnormally repetitive.

====Ritualized and stereotyped behaviors====
Though obsessive-compulsive behaviors are often considered to be pathological or [[maladaptive]], some ritualized and stereotyped behaviors are beneficial.  These are usually known as '''[[fixed action pattern]]s.'''  These behaviors sometimes share characteristics with obsessive-compulsive behavior, including a high degree of similarity in form and use among many individuals and a repetitive dimension.

There are many observable animal behaviors with characteristic, highly conserved patterns.  One example is [[personal grooming|grooming]] behavior in rats.  This behavior is defined by a specific sequence of actions that does not normally differ between individual rats.  The rat first begins by stroking its [[whiskers]], then expands the stroking motion to include the eyes and the ears, finally moving on to lick both sides of its body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalueff | first1 = A. V. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2007 | title = Analyzing grooming microstructure in neurobehavioral experiments | url = | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 2538–2544 | doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.367}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other behaviors may be added to the end of this chain, but these four actions themselves are fixed.  Its ubiquity and high degree of [[stereotypy]] suggest that this is a beneficial behavior pattern which has been maintained throughout evolutionary history.

Pathological stereotyped behaviors also exist in animals, but they do not necessarily provide a similar model to OCD in humans.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  [[Feather plucking|Feather picking]] in [[orange-winged amazon|orange-winged amazon parrots]] has both a genetic component, with the behavior being more likely in one sibling if the other does it, and more common in parrots close to a door when they were housed in groups.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, J. P., et al.  2006.  Genetic, environmental and neighbor effects on severity of stereotypies and feather picking in Orange-winged Amazon parrots (Amazona amazonica): An epidemiological study.  Applied Animal Behaviour Science 96, 153-168.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same study found that feather picking was more common in females and that there was no social transmission of the behavior; neighbors of feather picking birds were only more likely to show the behavior as well if they were related.

====An evolutionary basis====
Some researchers believe that disadvantageous obsessive compulsive behaviors can be thought of as a normally beneficial process gone too far.  Brüne (2006) suggests that change of various origin in [[Striatum|striatal]] and [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] brain circuits, which play a role in predicting needs and threats that may arise in the future, may result in a hyperactive cognitive harm avoidance system, in which a person becomes consciously and unreasonably fearful of an unlikely or impossible event.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22158981&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16960303&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|pmid= 16960303
|doi=10.1353/pbm.2006.0037}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This may also be true in other animals.

====Genetic factors====
Looking for a genetic link, Hannes Lohi, a professor of canine genomics at the [[University of Helsinki]] has observed that canine compulsions are typically more common in certain breeds and behavioral dispositions are often shared within the same litter. This suggests that there is a genetic factor to the disorder. Lohi hoped to prove this through a questionnaire to dog owners and a blood sample of 181 dogs from four breeds: [[Bull Terrier (Miniature)|miniature]] and [[bull terrier|standard]] bull terriers, [[German shepherds]], and [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier|Staffordshire bull terriers]], all breeds shown to be more susceptive to compulsive and repetitive behaviors used to release anxiety.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23120887&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1112-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; J.A. Miller suggests that the more we learn through studying Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in dogs, the more we can come to understand about human biology and the genetics involved in the heredity of susceptibility to disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller, J.A. 1992&quot;&gt;Miller, J.A. (1992). Look who's clucking! Bioscience, (42:4), 257-259. {{jstor|1311673}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research done by the Behavior Service at the [[Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine]], the Program in Medical Genetics at the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]], and the Broad Institute at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] have supposedly located a [[chromosome]] in dogs that confers a high risk of susceptibility to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Pharma Business Week. (January 2010). Canine compulsive disorder gene identified in dogs. Pp. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Canine chromosome 7 has been found to be most significantly associated with obsessive compulsive disorder in dogs, or more specifically, canine compulsive disorder (CCD). This breakthrough helped further relate OCD in humans to CCD in canines. Canine chromosome 7 is expressed in the [[hippocampus]] of the brain, the same area that Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is expressed in human patients. Similar pathways are involved in drug treatment responses for both humans and dogs, offering more research that the two creatures exhibit symptoms and respond to treatment in similar ways. This data can help scientists to discover more effective and efficient ways to treat OCD in humans through the information they find by studying CCD in dogs.

====Animal models====
Animals exhibiting obsessive and compulsive behaviors that resemble OCD in humans have been used as a tool for elucidating possible genetic influences on the disease, potential treatments, and to better understand the pathology of this behavior in general.  While such models are useful, they are also limited; it is unclear whether the behavior is [[ego dystonic]] in animals.  That is, it is difficult to evaluate whether an animal is aware that its behavior is excessive and unreasonable and whether this awareness is a source of anxiety.

One study done by Simon Vermeier used [[neuroimaging]] to investigate [[serotonergic]] and [[dopaminergic]] neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) to measure the [[serotonin 2A receptor]] availability. When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD were found to have lower receptor availability as well as lower subcortical perfusion and [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] availability . The results of this study provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs. Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct validity for this study, which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22285716 &quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Some treatment has been given to dogs with CCD to observe their reactions and how they are similar or different from how humans would react to the same pharmaceutical or behavioral treatment. A combination of the two approaches has been found to be most effective in lowering the intensity and regularity of OCD in both canines and humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12458615&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

One study by Karen Overall discovered that by combining behavioral therapy with the more effective clomipramine, the symptoms of Canine Compulsive Disorder decreased by over 50% for all of the dogs involved in the study.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12458615&quot; /&gt; Overall acknowledges that OCD is not something that can be completely cured, but studies like this are still important because Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be controlled effectively enough so it does not interfere with one's life, a valuable and commonly sought after thing for those who suffer from the disorder.

Alicia Graef's article &lt;ref&gt;Graef, A. (October 2013). Can dogs lead us to a cure for obsessive-compulsive disorder? Care 2 Make a Difference. http://www.care2.com/causes/can-dogs-lead-us-to-a-cure-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder.html&lt;/ref&gt; makes several bold claims that dogs are the future in understanding how to better diagnose, recognize, and treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in humans. There is evidence supporting her statements, but the connection between CCD and OCD is not clearly understood. So far, studies have proved that effective treatments in dogs are similarly effective for humans, but there are still so many things unknown. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a unique mental disorder that cannot be fully cured. It can be controlled and understood, and one possible way of better doing that might be through studying CCD in canines. Studying dogs that exhibit compulsive behaviors has led scientists to genetic breakthroughs in understanding more how biology and genetics factor into Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. By observing and studying how CCD manifests in the brain activity, behaviors, and genes of diagnosed canines, scientists have been able to use their newfound information to develop better diagnostic tests and more readily recognize symptoms and susceptible humans. The similar brain functions and behaviors of dogs with CCD and humans with OCD suggests they have a connection, not only in behavior and symptoms, but in reacting to treatments. Understanding Canine Compulsive Disorder in dogs has helped scientists to better understand and apply their learning to developing new and more effective ways to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in humans.

Some examples of ways in which rats and mice, two of the most common animal models, have been used to represent human OCD are provided below.

'''Lever pressing in rats'''

Certain [[laboratory rat#strains|laboratory rat strains]] that have been created by controlled breeding for many generations show a higher tendency towards compulsive behaviors than other strains.  Lewis rats show more compulsive lever pressing behavior than Sprague Dawley or Wistar rats and are less responsive to the anti-compulsive drug [[paroxetine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17320982&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Once food was no longer provided when they pressed the lever, rats were expected to stop pressing it.  Lewis rats pressed the lever more often than the other two types, even though they had presumably learned that they would not receive food, and continued to press it more often even after treatment with the drug.  An analysis of the genetic differences between the three rat strains might help to identify genes that might be responsible for the compulsive behavior.

Rats have also been used to test the possibility of a problem with [[dopamine]] levels in the brains of animals that exhibit compulsive checking behavior.  After treating rats with [[quinpirole]], a chemical that specifically blocks [[Dopamine receptor|dopamine D2/D3 receptors]], compulsive checking of certain locations in an open field increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16524632&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|pmid= 16524632

This means that there might be both all-or-none and a sensitization aspects in the biology of the dopamine deficiency model of OCD.  In addition, quinpirole might reduce a sense of satisfaction in the rats after they check a location, causing them to return to that location again and again.

'''Estrogen deficiency in male mice'''

Based on findings of changes in OCD symptoms in [[menstruation|menstruating]] women and differences in the development of the disease between men and women, Hill and colleagues set out to research the effect of [[estrogen]] deprivation on the development of compulsive behavior in mice.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16566897&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

When treated with [[Estradiol|17β-estradiol]], which replaced estrogen in these mice, the behaviors disappeared.  This study also found that [[Catechol-O-methyl transferase|COMT protein]] levels decreased in mice that did not produce estrogen and increased in the [[hypothalamus]] after estrogen-replacement treatment.  Briefly, the COMT protein is involved in degrading some neurotransmitters, including dopamine, [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]].  This data suggests that there may be a hormonal component and a hormone-gene interaction effect that may contribute to obsessive behaviors.

'''Pets'''

[[File:Canine lick granuloma.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lick granuloma]] from excessive licking]]
Dr. Nicholas Dodman describes a wide variety of OCD-like behaviors in his book Dogs Behaving Badly.&lt;ref&gt;Dodman, Nicholas.  1999.  Dogs Behaving Badly: An A-to-Z Guide to Understanding &amp; Curing Behavioral Problems in Dogs.  Bantam Books: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such behaviors typically appear when the dog is placed in a stressful situation, including an environment that is not very stimulating or a history of abuse.  Different breeds of dog seem to display different compulsions.  [[Lick granuloma]], or licking repeatedly until [[ulcer]]s form on the skin, affects more large dogs, like [[Labradors]], [[golden retrievers]], [[Great Danes]], and [[Doberman]]s, while [[Bull Terrier|bull terriers]], [[German shepherd]]s, [[Old English Sheepdog|Old English sheepdogs]], [[Rottweilers]], [[Fox Terrier (Wire)|wire-haired fox terriers]], and [[English Springer Spaniel|springer spaniel]]s are more likely to snap at imaginary flies or chase light and shadows.  These associations probably have an evolutionary basis, although Dodman does not clearly explain that aspect of the behaviors.

Louis Shuster and Nicholas Dodman noticed that dogs often demonstrate obsessive and compulsive behaviors similar to humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20651132&quot;&gt;{{cite journal 
|vauthors=Holden C, Travis J |date = Jul 2010|title = Profile: Nicholas Dodman. Can dogs behaving badly suggest a new way to treat OCD?|journal = Science|volume = 329|issue = 5990|pages = 386–7|pmid = 20651132|doi = 10.1126/science.329.5990.386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) is not only specific only to certain breeds of dogs, but the breed may affect the specific types of compulsions. For example, bull terriers frequently exhibit obsessively predatory or aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;petmd.com&quot;&gt;Anxiety and compulsive disorders in dogs. (2013). PetMD. http://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/behavioral.&lt;/ref&gt; Breed may factor into the types of compulsions, but some behaviors are more common across the canine spectrum. Most commonly, CCD is seen in canines as they repeat behaviors such as chasing their tails, compulsively chewing on objects, or licking their paws excessively, similar to the common hand-washing compulsion many people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder have.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller, J.A. 1992&quot;/&gt; Hallucinating and attacking the air around their head, as if there were a bug there, is another compulsion that has been seen in some dogs. Circling, hair biting, staring, and sometimes even barking are other examples of behaviors that are considered compulsions in dogs when taken to extreme, repetitive actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;petmd.com&quot;/&gt;

====Treatment (Pharmaceutical)====

Dodman advocates the use of exercised, an [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|enriched environment]] (like providing noises for dogs to listen to while owners are at work), and often [[Prozac]] (an [[SSRI]] used to treat OCD in humans) as treatments.

Shuster and Dodman tested pharmaceutical treatment on canines with CCD to see if it would work as effectively as it does in humans. They used [[glutamate receptor]] blockers ([[memantine]]) and [[fluoxetine]], commonly known as the antidepressant Prozac, to treat and observe the reactions of 11 dogs with compulsions. Seven of the 11 dogs significantly reduced their compulsions in intensity and frequency after receiving medication.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20651132&quot; /&gt;

Dodman includes a story about Hogan, a castrated deaf male [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]], and his compulsive behavior.  Hogan had a history of neglect and abuse before he was adopted by Connie and Jim, who attempted to improve his behavior by teaching him to respond to American Sign Language.  The following are some excerpts from Hogan's file.

:&quot;''All was well for a year and a half when suddenly, one March morning, he woke up and started pawing everything in sight, and just wouldn't stop.  He pawed rugs and blankets, hardwood floors and linoleum, grass and dirt surfaces...The similarity between what he was doing and prey-seeking behavior was remarkable.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dodman, Nicholas. 1999. Dogs Behaving Badly: An A-to-Z Guide to Understanding &amp; Curing Behavioral Problems in Dogs. Bantam Books: New York. pp. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;''I do believe...that Hogan was under some kind of psychological pressure at the time the compulsive pawing behavior developed... Connie and Jim were compelled to leave him for some eight hours a day while they went to work...The pendulum was set and ready to swing.  The actual compulsion that develops under such circumstances is less relevant than the fact that one 'does' develop.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dodman, Nicholas. 1999. Dogs Behaving Badly: An A-to-Z Guide to Understanding &amp; Curing Behavioral Problems in Dogs. Bantam Books: New York. pp. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;''The &quot;three R's&quot; of rehabilitation are exercise, nutrition, and communication.  First, I advised Connie to step up Hogan's exercise to a minimum of thirty minutes of aerobic activity a day. In addition, I advised that Hogan should be fed a low-protein, preservative-free diet.  Completing the rehabilitation checklist, I exhorted Connie to work even harder with the sign-language and instructed her on a new sign to use when Hogan started digging.  The sign was a piece of card with the letter 'H' written on it in thick black pen. Connie was to show Hogan this sign as soon as possible after he engaged in a bout of unwanted pawing and then leave the room.  The idea was to let him know that the behavior was not wanted by signaling to him that Connie was about to leave the room...Call me a coward, but I didn't think that alone would cut it because of previous experiences with canine compulsive disorders so, employing a belt-and-suspenders strategy, I also advised medicating Hogan with the [[tricyclic]] antidepressant [[Elavil]].  Theoretically, Elavil wouldn't be that good in obsessive-compulsive behavior but, limited for reasons of expense, and bearing in mind the possible contribution of separation anxiety, Elavil was my best shot.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dodman, Nicholas. 1999. Dogs Behaving Badly: An A-to-Z Guide to Understanding &amp; Curing Behavioral Problems in Dogs. Bantam Books: New York. pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;''It took six months before Hogan was over the hump of treatment success...At this time Hogan only engaged in occasional pawing of significantly reduced intensity, and the pawing only occurred in moments of stress. Connie reported that stresses particularly likely to induce pawing included being unable to find her and sensing that he was about to be left alone...Hogan continued to improve and reached a point at which he was almost pawing-free - but not quite.  That seems to be the way with compulsive disorders in man and beast.  They can be reduced to the level of permitting affectees to lead relatively normal lives, but there are occasional relapses.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dodman, Nicholas. 1999. Dogs Behaving Badly: An A-to-Z Guide to Understanding &amp; Curing Behavioral Problems in Dogs. Bantam Books: New York. pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addiction===
[[Sugar addiction]] has been examined in [[laboratory rats]] and it develops in the same way that [[drug addiction]] develops. Eating sugary foods causes the brain to release natural chemicals called [[opioids]] and [[dopamine]] in the [[limbic system]]. Tasty food can activate opioid receptors in the [[ventral tegmental area]] and thereby stimulate cells that release dopamine in the [[nucleus accumbens]] (NAc). The brain recognizes the intense pleasure derived from the dopamine and opioids release and learns to crave more sugar. Dependence is created through these natural rewards, the sugary treats, and the opioid and dopamine released into the synapses of the [[mesolimbic system]]. The hippocampus, the [[insular cortex|insula]] and the [[caudate nucleus|caudate]] activate when rats crave sugar, which are the same areas that become active when drug addicts crave the drug. Sugar is good because its provides energy but when the body becomes dependent on the sugar intake and the [[nervous system]] goes through a change somatic signs of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] begin to appear like chattering teeth, forepaw tremors and head shakes when sugar is not ingested.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12055324&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Morphine tolerance does not depend merely on the frequency of pharmacological stimulation, but rather on both the number of pairings of a drug-predictive cue with the systemic effects of the drug. Rats became significantly more tolerant to morphine when they had been exposed to a paired administration than those rats that were not administered morphine along with a drug-predictive cue.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid670891&quot; /&gt;

===Depression===
Using dogs, [[Martin Seligman]] and his colleagues pioneered the study of [[depression (mood)|depression]] in the animal model of [[learned helplessness]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Dogs were separated into three groups, the control group, group A had control over when they were being [[Electric shock|shocked]] and group B had no control over when they were being shocked. After the shocking condition the dogs were tested in a shuttle box where they could escape shock by jumping over a partition. To eliminate an interference effect - that the dogs did not learn responses while being shocked that would interfere with their normal [[escape behavior]] - the dogs were immobilized using [[curare]], a paralyzing drug while they were being shocked. Both the control group and group A tended to jump over the partition to escape shock while group B dogs did not jump and would passively take the shock. The dogs in group B perceived that the outcome was not related to their efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;curedisease.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curedisease.com/Perspectives/vol_1_1989/Learned%20Helplessness.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815165813/http://www.curedisease.com:80/Perspectives/vol_1_1989/Learned%20Helplessness.html |archivedate=2007-08-15 |df= }}  Hahner, K.

The lack of [[neurogenesis]] has been linked to depression. Animals with stress (isolated, [[cortisol]] levels) show a decrease in neurogenesis and [[antidepressants]] have been discovered to promote neurogenesis. Rene Hen and his colleagues at [[Columbia University]] ran a study on rats in which they blocked neurogenesis by applying [[radiation]] to the [[hippocampal]] area to test the efficacy of antidepressants. Results suggested that antidepressants failed to work when neurogenesis was inhibited.

===Stress===
[[Robert Sapolsky]] has extensively studied [[baboon]]s in their natural environment in the [[Serengeti]] in [[Africa]]. He noticed that baboons have very similar hierarchies in their society as do humans. They spend very few hours searching for food and fulfilling their primary needs leaving them with time to develop their social network. In primates mental stresses show up in the body. Primates experience psychological stresses that can elicit physiological responses that overtime can make them sick. Sapolsky observed the baboon's ranks, personalities and social affiliations then collected blood samples of the baboons to control the cortisol (stress hormone) levels of the baboons then matched social position to cortisol levels. Most of the data have been collected from male baboons because at any given time 80 percent of the females were pregnant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy, D 2001&quot;&gt;Levy, D. 2001. We can all relate to stressed-out baboons. Standford Report.&lt;/ref&gt;  Three factors influenced a baboon's cortisol levels; friendships, perspective and rank.  Baboons that played with infants and cultivated friendships, could tell if a situation was a real threat and could tell if they were going to win or lose, and were top ranking had lower levels of cortisol. Cortisol levels rise with age and hippocampal cells express fewer hormone receptors on their surface to protect themselves from excess, making it harder to control stress levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy, D 2001&quot; /&gt;  Cortisol levels are elevated in half of people suffering from major depression, it is the hippocampal region that is affected by both. Stress can have negative effects on gastrointestinal function causing ulcers, and it can also decrease [[sex drive]], effect sleeping patterns and elevate [[blood pressure]] but it can also stimulate and motivate. When animals experience stress they are generally more alert than when they are not stressed. It may help them be better aware of unfamiliar environments and possible threats to their life in these environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maestripieri | first1 = D. | year = 2005 | title = Book Reviews: Primate Psychology | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 245–248 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yerkes and Dodson developed a law that explains the empirical relationship between arousal and performance illustrated by and inverted U-shape graph.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbass.com&quot;&gt;Ripped Enterprises website.  http://cbass.com/Breakout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Yerkes-Dodson Law performance increases as does cognitive arousal but only to a certain point. The downward part of the U-shape is caused by stress and as stress increases so does efficiency and performance but to a certain point.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbass.com&quot; /&gt;  When stress becomes too great performance and efficiency decline. Sapolsky has also studied stress in rats and his results indicate that early experiences in young rats have strong, lasting effects. Rats that were exposed to human handling (stressful situation) had finely tuned stress responses that may have lowered their lifetime exposure to stress hormones compared to those that were not handled. In short stress can be adaptive. The more exposure to stressful situations the better the rat can handle that situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy, D 2001&quot; /&gt;

===Stereotypies===
'''[[stereotypy|Stereotypies]]''' are repetitive, sometimes abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds. There are adaptive stereotypic behaviors such as grooming in cats and preening in birds. Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies. These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal. Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. Feather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness as studies have shown that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone to feather pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true stereotypy and is more like hair pulling in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a stereotypy but vocalization is part of a parrot's natural behavior.  Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation. Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, J.P., Meehan, C.L., Famula, T.R. &amp; Mench, J.A. 2006. Genetic, environmental, and neighbor effects on the severity of stereotypies and feather picking in Orange-winged Amazon parrots (Amazona amazonica): An epidemiological study. Applied Animal Behaviour Science. 96, 153-168.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example the presence or absence of certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high stocking density (especially for tail biting in pigs). These behaviors can also be transmitted through social learning.  [[Bank vole]]s, [[pigeons]] and pigs when housed next to animals that show stereotypies, pick them up as well as through stimulus enhancement which is what happens in tail biting in pigs and feather pecking by hens.&lt;ref&gt;Vieuille-Thomas C., Le Pape G., Signoret J.P.1995. Stereotypies in pregnant sows: indications of influence of the housing system on the patterns expressed by the animals. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 44(1), pp. 19-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypies may be coping mechanisms as results suggest from study on tethered and stalled sows. Sows that are tethered and stalled exhibited more stereotypies like licking and rubbing than sows that are in groups outdoors. This abnormal behavior seems to be related to opioid (related to the reward system) receptor density.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8778865&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

[[mu opioid receptor|Mu]] and [[kappa opioid receptor|Kappa]] receptors are associated with aversion behaviors and Mu receptor density is greater in tethered sows than sows that are in groups outdoors. However, sows with stereotypy behaviors experienced a decrease both in Mu and Kappa receptor density in the brain suggesting that inactivity increases Mu receptor density and stereotypy development decrease both kappa and Mu receptor density.

===Self-aggression===
{{further|Self-injury#Other animals}}
[[Rhesus macaque]]s have been observed to display self-aggression (SA) including self-biting, self-clasping, self-slapping, self-rubbing and threatening of body parts. The rhesus macaques observed were individually caged and free of disease. Their self-aggression level rose in stressful and stimulating conditions such as moving from one cage to another.&lt;ref&gt;Pond, C. L., &amp; Rush, H. G. 1983. Self-aggression in macaques: Five case studies. Pimates, 24(1), 127-134.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stump-tailed macaque]]s were studied to examine the source of their SA. SA increased in an impoverished environment and results support that SA may increase sensory input in poor environments. Captive macaques do not socialize the way wild macaques do which may affect SA. When allowed to socialize by putting another macaque in the cage or not putting them in a cage, SA levels in macaques decrease. Results indicate that SA is a form of redirected social aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Chamove, A. S., Anderson, J. R., &amp; Nash, V. J. 1984.  Social and environmental influences on self-aggression in monkeys. Primates, 25(3), 319-325.&lt;/ref&gt;  SA is related to frustration and social status, especially in macaques that have an intermediate dominance rank.&lt;ref&gt;De Monte, M., Anderson, J. R., &amp; Charbonnier, H., 1992. Self-aggression in stumptail macaques: Effects of frustration and social partners. Primates, 33(1), 115-120.&lt;/ref&gt;
