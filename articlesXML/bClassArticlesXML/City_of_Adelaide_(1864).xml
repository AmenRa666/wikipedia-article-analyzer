'''''City of Adelaide''''' is a [[clipper]] ship, built in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], England, and launched on 7 May 1864.  The ship was commissioned in the [[Royal Navy]] as '''HMS ''Carrick''''' between 1923 and 1948 and, after decommissioning, was known as '''''Carrick''''' until 2001.  At a conference convened by [[HRH The Duke of Edinburgh]] in 2001, the decision was made to revert the ship's name to ''City of Adelaide'', and the duke formally renamed her at a ceremony in 2013.

''City of Adelaide'' was built by [[William Pile, Hay and Co.]] for transporting passengers and goods between Britain and Australia. Between 1864 and 1887 the ship made 23 annual return voyages from [[London]] and [[Plymouth]] to [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. During this period she played an important part in the [[Immigration history of Australia|immigration of Australia]].  On the return voyages she carried passengers, wool, and copper from Adelaide and [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] to London. From 1869&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article197650923 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[Evening Journal |Evening Journal (Adelaide, SA : 1869 - 1912)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=20 September 1869 |accessdate=17 October 2015 |page=1 Edition: Late |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1885 she was part of [[Harrold Brothers]]' &quot;Adelaide Line&quot; of clippers.

After 1887 the ship carried coal around the British coast, and timber across the Atlantic. In 1893 she became a floating hospital in Southampton, and in 1923 was purchased by the Royal Navy. Converted as a training ship, she was also renamed HMS ''Carrick'' to avoid confusion with the newly commissioned [[HMAS Adelaide (1918)|HMAS ''Adelaide'']]. HMS ''Carrick'' was based in Scotland until 1948 when she was decommissioned and donated to the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Club, and towed into central [[Glasgow]] for use as the club's headquarters.

''Carrick'' remained on the [[River Clyde]] until 1989 when she was damaged by flooding. In order to safeguard the vessel she was protected as a [[listed building]], but in 1991 she sank at her mooring. ''Carrick'' was recovered by the [[Scottish Maritime Museum]] the following year, and moved to a private [[slipway]] adjacent to the museum's site in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]]. Restoration work began, but funding ceased in 1999, and from 2000 the future of the ship was in doubt.  After being served with an eviction notice by the owners of the slipway, the Scottish Maritime Museum was forced to seek the deconstruction of the ship on more than one occasion, while rescue proposals were developed by groups based in Sunderland and South Australia.

In 2010, the Scottish Government decided that the ship would be moved to Adelaide, to be preserved as a museum ship. In September 2013 the ship moved by barge from Scotland to the Netherlands to prepare for transport to Australia.  In late November 2013, loaded on the deck of a cargo ship, ''City of Adelaide'' departed Europe bound for [[Port Adelaide]], Australia, where she arrived on 3 February 2014.

==Significance==

''City of Adelaide'' is the world's oldest surviving [[clipper]] ship, of only two that survive — the other is ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' (built 1869; a tea-clipper and now a museum ship and tourist attraction in [[Greenwich]], south London). With ''Cutty Sark'' and {{HMS|Gannet|1878|6}} (built 1878; a [[sloop-of-war]] in Chatham), ''City of Adelaide'' is one of only three surviving ocean-going ships of [[composite ship|composite]] construction to survive.&lt;ref name=NHS_page&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/ships_register.php?action=ship&amp;id=433 |title=''City of Adelaide'' |date= |work=National Register of Historic Vessels|publisher= National Historic Ships |accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref|The wreck of the composite clipper ''[[Ambassador (clipper)|Ambassador]]'' (1869), a beached skeleton, also rests on a beach in [[Strait of Magellan]], near Estancia [[San Gregorio, Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/14287578@N04/3244264379/in/photostream/ |title=Chile - Magellan Strait - wreck of clipper Ambassador near Estancia San Gergorio |publisher=Flickr |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;note&quot;}}

''City of Adelaide'' is one of three surviving sailing ships, and the only of these a passenger ship, to have taken emigrants from the British Isles (the other two are ''[[Edwin Fox]]'' and [[Star of India (ship)|''Star of India'']]).{{#tag:ref|[[SS Great Britain|SS ''Great Britain'']], a sail-steamship, also carried migrants from the British Isles.|group=&quot;note&quot;}} ''City of Adelaide'' is the only surviving purpose-built passenger sailing ship.&lt;ref name=significance&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/history/world-significance.html |title=World Significance |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship |publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to her significance as an emigrant ship, ''City of Adelaide'' is the last survivor of the timber trade between North America and the United Kingdom. As this trade peaked at the same time as conflicts in Europe, a great mass of refugees sought cheap passage on the timber-trade ships, that would otherwise be returning empty, creating an unprecedented influx of new immigrants in North America.

Having been built in the years prior to [[Lloyd's Register]] publishing their [[Lloyd's Register#Classification rules|rules]] for composite ships, ''City of Adelaide'' is an important example in the development of [[naval architecture]].&lt;ref name=significance/&gt;&lt;ref name =RINA&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Peter |year= 2010 |title=Composite Clippers |url= http://content.yudu.com/A1p200/RINA150/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rina.org.uk%2F150Years.html |journal=The Royal Institution of Naval Architects 1860-2010 |publisher= Royal Institution of Naval Architects |pages= 84 |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK's Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships describes the significance of ''City of Adelaide'' in these terms:&lt;ref name=NHS_page/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;She highlights the early fast passenger-carrying and general cargo trade to the [[Antipodes]]. Her composite construction illustrates technical development in 19th shipbuilding techniques and scientific progress in [[metallurgy]] and her self-reefing top sails demonstrate the beginnings of modern labour saving technologies. Her service on the London to Adelaide route between 1864 and 1888 gives her an unrivalled associate status as one of the ships contributing to the growth of the Australian nation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In recognition of her significance, until departing the United Kingdom in 2013, ''City of Adelaide'' was an [[listed building|A-listed structure]] in Scotland, part of the [[National Historic Fleet]] of the United Kingdom, and listed in the Core Collection of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=NHS_page/&gt;

==Construction==

[[File:Midship section of Composite Ship.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Midship section of a composite ship|Midship section of a composite ship, by Henri Paasch, 1885]]
''City of Adelaide'' was designed to carry both passengers and cargo between England and Australia. Cabins could accommodate first-class and second-class passengers, and the hold could be fitted out for carrying [[steerage]]-class emigrants when needed.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

''City of Adelaide'' is of [[Composite ship|composite construction]] with timber planking on a wrought-iron frame. This method of construction provides the structural strength of an iron ship combined with the insulation of a timber hull. Unlike iron ships, where copper would cause corrosion in contact with the iron, the timber bottoms of composite ships could be [[Copper sheathing|sheathed with copper]] to prevent [[biofouling|fouling]].  The iron frames meant that composite ships could carry large amounts of canvas sail.  Composite ships were therefore some of the fastest ships afloat.&lt;ref name=Lubbock&gt;[[Basil Lubbock|Lubbock, Basil]] ''The Colonial Clippers''. Kessinger Books, New York 1991 ISBN 1-4179-6416-2 pp.144&amp;ndash;45;&lt;br /&gt;[https://ia600202.us.archive.org/15/items/colonialclippers00lubbrich/colonialclippers00lubbrich.pdf Lubbock, B. (1921) ''The Colonial Clippers''] 34 MB PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Composite ships were built in the relatively short period from c. 1860 to 1880. ''City of Adelaide'' was built in 1864 before [[Lloyd's Register]] recognised and endorsed composite ships in 1867.  Before this, all composite ships were labelled by Lloyds as being &quot;Experimental&quot;.&lt;ref name =RINA/&gt; Being a developmental technology in 1864 meant that many of the structural features on ''City of Adelaide'' are now regarded as being 'over-engineered', particularly when compared to other later composite ships like the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' (1869).  For example, the frame spacing on ''City of Adelaide'' is much closer together than seen on other composite ships.  This extra strength from 'over-engineering', together with the good fate to have benefited from human habitation and/or husbandry through to the late 1990s, has likely been a major factor why ''City of Adelaide'' has survived, even after being grounded on [[Grange, South Australia|Kirkcaldy Beach]] in [[South Australia]] for a week in 1874 (see below).{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

==Service history==

===Conception===
After having gained much experience on the London to Adelaide run with his ship ''Irene'', Captain David Bruce had ''City of Adelaide'' built expressly for the South Australia trade.&lt;ref name=reg1864&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39127175 |title=SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE. |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=8 November 1864 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The order for the ship was given to [[William Pile (shipbuilder)|William Pile]], Hay and Company of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] and she was launched on 7 May 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/construction.html |title=1864 Conception |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Captain Bruce took a quarter-share ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/david-bruce.html |title=Capt. David Bruce |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''City of Adelaide'' is frequently referred to as being owned by the British shipping firm [[Devitt and Moore]], but they were only the managing agents in London.  Partner Joseph Moore snr. was a syndicate member, holding a quarter-share in the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/devitt-and-moore.html |title=Devitt and Moore |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining two quarter-shares were taken up by South Australian interests - Harrold Brothers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/harrold-brothers.html |title=Harrold Brothers |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were the agents in Adelaide, and Henry Martin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/henry-martin.html |title=Henry Martin |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the working proprietor of the [[Yudnamutana, South Australia|Yudnamutana]] and [[Blinman]] copper mines in the [[Flinders Ranges]].

===South Australian trade — 1864–87===
The ship spent 23 years making annual runs to and from South Australia, playing an important role in the development of the colony. Researchers have estimated that a quarter of a million South Australians can trace their origins to passengers on ''City of Adelaide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/250k-descendants.html |title=1/4 Million Descendants |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least six diaries kept by passengers describing voyages have survived from the 23 return voyages between London and Adelaide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/Diary-Transcripts/ |title=Diary Transcripts |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''City of Adelaide'' was among the fastest clippers on the London—Adelaide run, sharing the record of 65 days with ''Yatala'', which was later broken only by the ''[[Torrens (clipper ship)|Torrens]]''.{{sfn|Lubbock|p=155}}

On 24 August 1874, the ship was stranded on Kirkcaldy Beach near Grange, six miles south of [[Semaphore, South Australia|Semaphore]] near Adelaide. On board at the time were over 320 people, including one of the diarists, a Scot named James McLauchlan.  An outbreak of [[scarlet fever]] had occurred during the voyage and seven people died.  Two babies were born on board during the voyage - one was &quot;born dead&quot;.&lt;ref name=diary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/diary-of-james-mclauchlan.html |title=Diary of James Anderson McLauchlan |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon reaching South Australian waters at the end of this voyage, severe gales were encountered resulting in the stranding of ''City of Adelaide''. The storms also caused accidents and losses of other vessels along the South Australian coast.  The schooner ''Mayflower'', on her way from [[Port Broughton, South Australia|Port Broughton]] to [[Port Adelaide]], lost her mate Richard Burton, 32, overboard and he drowned: he was on his way to Port Adelaide to meet his wife, Isabella, 29, who was one of the immigrants on board the ''City of Adelaide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5878076 |title=TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1874. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=8 September 1874 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the cargo on this voyage were two [[Scottish Deerhound]]s, bred by the Marquis of Lorne, [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll]], and being imported by Sir [[Thomas Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28734015 |title=VIII.—AGRICULTURAL. |newspaper=[[The South Australian Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=10 September 1874 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after the stranding the passengers were removed by steam tugs. ''City of Adelaide'' was refloated on 4 September after much of the cargo had been discharged and much of the rigging temporarily removed.  The ship was virtually undamaged.

By the 1880s, ''City of Adelaide'' was also calling at [[Port Augusta, South Australia]] on return voyages.  At Port Augusta, copper from Henry Martin's [[Blinman]] and [[Yudnamutana, South Australia|Yudnamutana]] copper mines in the [[Flinders Ranges]] and wool from outback [[sheep station]]s was loaded before racing to the wool sales in London.

During this time, in 1881, the ship was rerigged as a [[barque]].

===Coal trade — 1887–88===
In 1887, ''City of Adelaide'' was sold to Dover coal merchant, Charles Havelock Mowll, for use in the [[Collier (ship)|collier]] trade carrying [[coal]] from the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] to [[Dover]].

===Timber trade — 1888–93===
[[File:Aboutement de bois equarri Quebec 1872.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Butting square timber, Quebec City, QC, 1872.]]
{{See also|Economic history of Canada#Timber}}
In 1888, ''City of Adelaide'' was sold to Belfast-based timber merchants Daniel and Thomas Stewart Dixon, and was used to carry timber in the North Atlantic trade.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

By the start of the 18th century, Britain had exhausted its supplies of the great [[oak]]s that had built the [[Royal Navy]].  The lack of large trees was problematic as they were a necessity for masts for both war and merchant shipping. A thriving timber import business developed between Britain and the [[Baltic region]] but was unpopular for economic and strategic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Ball, &quot;Timber!&quot;, ''Beaver'', April 987, Vol. 67#2 pp 45-56&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Napoleonic Wars]] and a Continental blockade had a large impact on the Baltic trade and so Britain looked to the North American colonies that were still loyal.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

The North Atlantic timber trade became a massive business and timber was [[British North America]]'s most important commodity. In one summer, 1,200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

As timber is a very bulky cargo, it required many ships to carry it from North America to Britain, but there was little demand for carrying goods on the return voyages. However, there was a market for carrying migrants, so many of the timber ships turned to the migrant trade to fill their unused capacity. Since timber exports tended to peak at the same time as conflicts in Europe, a great mass of refugees sought cheap passage across the Atlantic. This created an unprecedented influx of new immigrants in North America.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

The timber trade not only brought immigrants to British North America but also played a very important role in keeping them there.  While many of those disembarking from the timber-trade ships headed south to the United States, many stayed in British North America.  At the peak of the trade in the 1840s, 15,000 Irish loggers were employed in the [[Gatineau]] region alone at a time when the population of [[Montreal]] was only 10,000.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

''City of Adelaide'' was home-ported in Belfast and from there frequented several British North American ports, most frequently [[Miramichi, New Brunswick]].{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

Of the thousands of sailing ships involved in the timber trade between North America and the United Kingdom, ''City of Adelaide'' is the last survivor.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}

The ''City of Adelaide'' ended her sailing career in 1893, when purchased by [[Southampton]] Corporation for £1750 to serve as a floating isolation hospital.  During one year of operation, 23 cases of scarlet fever were cared for. In 2009, the [[National Health Service (England)]] named a new hospital at [[Millbrook, Southampton]], in honour of the ship - the Adelaide Health Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Welcome to the Adelaide Health Centre |publisher=National Health Service |date=30 June 2009 |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/adelaide-health-centre-millbrook-uk-30-jun-09.html |accessdate=15 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Navy and Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve — 1922–48===
In 1923, ''City of Adelaide'' was purchased by the [[Admiralty]] and towed to Irvine, Scotland, where she was placed on the same slipway that she was to return to in 1992.  After conversion to a training ship, she was towed to Greenock and commissioned as a Naval Drill Ship for the newly constituted Clyde Division of the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR)]].&lt;ref name=moore&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/maree-moore-devitt-account.html |title=Account of Maree Moore |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the new cruiser [[HMAS Adelaide (1918)|HMAS ''Adelaide'']] had been commissioned only the previous year, to avoid confusion of two British Empire ships named ''Adelaide'' the clipper was renamed HMS ''Carrick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/our-news/our-news-articles/107-2013-news/812-renaming-ceremony.html |title=Renaming Ceremony - Greenwich - 18 October 2013 |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship |publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===R.N.V.R. Club (Scotland) — 1948–90===

After the war the ship was scheduled for breaking up, but through the work of Commodore [[James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose|James Graham, Duke of Montrose]], Vice-Admiral Cedric S. Holland and Admiral Sir Charles Morgan, she was presented by the Admiralty to the R.N.V.R. Club (Scotland), an organisation founded by Lieutenant commander [[J. Alastair Montgomerie]] in the autumn of 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;herald&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/death-of-carrick-club-s-commodore-1.597778 |title=Death of Carrick club's commodore |publisher=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]] |date=22 December 1989 |accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The towing of HMS ''Carrick'' upriver from Greenock to [[Harland and Wolff]]'s shipyard at Scotstoun on 26 April 1948, was known as 'Operation Ararat'.  A grant of 5,000&amp;nbsp;pounds was received from the King George's Fund for Sailors and 500&amp;nbsp;pounds was donated from the City of Glasgow War Fund.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;

After fitting out, ''Carrick'' was towed further up-river to a berth at Custom House Quay, just above Jamaica Bridge. A plaque on board commemorates the opening ceremony of the Club, which was carried out by [[Admiral of the Fleet]] [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope]].  The ship stayed there until January 1954 when the Clyde Navigation Trust decided to move her to the opposite side of the river at Carlton Place.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;

[[File:City of Adelaide in Princes Dock in 1991.jpg|thumb|220px|right| ''City of Adelaide'' sank in Princes Dock, Glasgow, in 1991 under mysterious circumstances.| ''City of Adelaide'' sank in Princes Dock, Glasgow, in 1991 under mysterious circumstances.]]

By the mid-1980s the Club realised that it could not afford to maintain its floating clubrooms.  It commenced seeking ways of securing the ship's future and passing on ownership, and contacted various bodies with potential interest including the then recently established Scottish Maritime Museum.

===Museum ship — 1990 to present===

====Clyde Ship Trust====
In 1989 there proved to be some need for haste, when the ship was flooded when the deck edge was trapped beneath the wharf on a very low tide. The Club in some desperation took the option on its insurance of having the vessel declared a total loss. To facilitate the preservation of the ship, [[Glasgow District Council]] applied for Listed Building status. [[Historic Scotland]] agreed to take the unusual step of listing a historic vessel as Category A – normally only applied to historic buildings. Listing was viewed as a boost to the preservation project.

By 1990 a new body, the Clyde Ship Trust, had been formed and, in March of that year, had purchased the vessel for £1. Under the control of the new Trust the vessel was dismasted and prepared for removal and in August 1990, was towed downstream to [[Princes Dock (Clyde)|Princes Dock]].

Early in 1991, for reasons that have not been clearly identified, the vessel sank at her moorings. The Clyde Ship Trust was placed in a position of embarrassment, for, being already in debt, it was unable to put forward the funds required for a major salvage operation. It became necessary for other organisations to step in to attempt to prevent the total loss of the ship.

====Scottish Maritime Museum====
In 1992, with the encouragement of Historic Scotland and [[Scottish Enterprise]], who provided the bulk of the £500,000 required to fund the rescue, the ship was salvaged by the [[Scottish Maritime Museum]] and moved to [[Irvine, North Ayrshire]], with the expectation to preserve and eventually restore the vessel.&lt;ref name=smm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishmaritimemuseum.org/adelaide.html |title=''City of Adelaide'' |date= |publisher=Scottish Maritime Museum |accessdate=15 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730034804/http://www.scottishmaritimemuseum.org/adelaide.html |archivedate=30 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship was identified as part of the UK [[National Historic Ships]] Core Collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS_page&quot;/&gt;

In September 1993 ''City of Adelaide'' was slipped on the same slipway near the [[Scottish Maritime Museum]] on which she had been converted in 1923. From then a programme of work was planned and operated on two fronts: preservation and restoration; and to allow public access and good quality interpretation.

Work continued until 1999 when Scotland regained its own parliament, UK funding sources for the Scottish Maritime Museum dried up. The museum was subsequently evicted from the slipway site, placing the museum under great pressure to remove ''City of Adelaide'' and the museum began to seek alternative options for the clipper.

====Clipper Ship City of Adelaide Ltd. (CSCOAL)====
The ownership of the vessel transferred from the Scottish Maritime Museum to [[Clipper Ship City of Adelaide Ltd.]] (CSCOAL) on 6 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City of Adelaide clipper handed to Australian owners|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-23975347|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
Since 1992, ''City of Adelaide'' was owned by the [[Scottish Maritime Museum]]. After slipping the clipper in 1993, the museum began a programme of work to preserve and restore the historic ship.

In May 1999 Scotland regained its own parliament.  A side effect of this was that previous UK funding sources for the [[Scottish Maritime Museum]] dried up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/smm.html | title =1992–2001 Scottish Maritime Museum |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL | accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This then had a snowball effect on the Scottish Maritime Museum.  An application for funding for the Museum's other major project, under the UK [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], was rejected.  Due to the eroded revenue position, the local municipality reduced its funding, and other grant-aiding organisations adopted a similar position.

Following the restructuring of local government in Scotland the Scottish Maritime Museum, as an independent charitable trust, appealed to the Scottish Executive for support. The Executive commissioned a report through the Scottish Museums Council that recommended the sale of ''City of Adelaide''.  The Museum began to receive government support but it was conditional on no government funds being spent on the vessel.  In 1999 all work on the ''City of Adelaide'' stopped and the shipwrights were moved to other projects.&lt;ref name=smm /&gt;

The Scottish Maritime Museum had agreed a contract with the owner of the slipway on which ''City of Adelaide'' was stored, specifying a [[peppercorn rent]] of £1 a year. However the contract included a penalty clause requiring payment of £50,000 per year should the owner require the museum to vacate the slipway.  SMM were given notice to quit in April 1999, and rental began to accrue.&lt;ref name=DTZ/&gt; Faced with these potential demands, and unable to find a buyer for the vessel, in May 2000 the trustees of the Scottish Maritime Museum applied to [[North Ayrshire Council]] for listed building consent to deconstruct ''City of Adelaide''.&lt;ref name = NAC2000&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eplanning.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/OnlinePlanning/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=0000392LBC | title= Demolition of clipper ship &quot;Carrick&quot; – &quot;City of Adelaide&quot; |publisher=North Ayrshire Council |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council received over 100 objections, including representations from nine significant maritime heritage organisations around the world. Members of the UK and [[Scottish Parliament]]s objected, as well as the Australian Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] and Australian ex-Senator and diplomat [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/ChiefExec/ArchiveCommRA.nsf/e9ee67f48fbb9003802569d700533758/af19a496b7884bc5802569f100346aab?OpenDocument |title=Demolition of clipper ship 'Carrick' – City of Adelaide |date=26 February 2001 |publisher=North Ayrshire Council |accessdate=15 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512184710/http://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/ChiefExec/ArchiveCommRA.nsf/e9ee67f48fbb9003802569d700533758/af19a496b7884bc5802569f100346aab?OpenDocument |archivedate=12 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council refused demolition in February 2001.&lt;ref name= NAC2000 /&gt;

[[File:City of Adelaide 2001 Prince Philip Conference.jpg|thumb|right|South Australian and Sunderland delegates on board ''City of Adelaide'' during the conference convened by HRH The Duke of Edinburgh]]

====Duke of Edinburgh Conference====
As a result of an initiative from [[HRH The Duke of Edinburgh]] a conference was convened in Glasgow in September 2001 to discuss the future of the vessel. The conference was chaired by [[Admiral of the Fleet]] Sir [[Julian Oswald]], and in addition to HRH The Duke of Edinburgh was attended by representatives of the [[High Commission of Australia in London]], Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Group, [[City of Sunderland]] Council, Cutty Sark Trust, [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], Heritage Lottery Fund, [[Historic Scotland]], [[North Ayrshire Council]], [[National Historic Ships]] Committee, [[Scottish Executive]], Scottish Maritime Museum, [[Government of South Australia]], and Sunderland Maritime Heritage. The conference concluded that the ''City of Adelaide'' is one of the most important historic vessels in the UK, but that resources available in Scotland were insufficient to ensure her survival. The Duke of Edinburgh proposed that [[The Maritime Trust]] and the SMM should work in partnership to fund a first phase of work. This phase would see the vessel removed from the slipway, on which the initial work had been completed, and placed on a barge or similar vessel and transhipped to another location. The Maritime Trust would take the lead in raising the funding support for the first phase.

'''Sunderland Maritime Heritage''' and the Adelaide-based '''Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Action Group''' both presented the conference with proposals for the vessel. The conference agreed that both organisations should now look to securing funding support for their proposals and an active dialogue would be maintained by all concerned. The aim of the Maritime Trust and the Scottish Maritime Museum would be that final transfer to either the Sunderland Maritime Trust or the Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Group would take place as quickly as possible.  The final decision of the conference was that as the significance of the vessel lay in her activities under her original name, she should in future be known simply as ''City of Adelaide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/2001-conference.html |title=2001 Conference |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Edwards proposal====
[[File:Clipper ship Carrick - City of Adelaide - geograph.org.uk - 360635.jpg|thumb|right|''City of Adelaide'' in April 2005]]
In 2003 businessman Mike Edwards donated funds for preservation and a feasibility study for the ship's restoration as a tourist adventure sailing ship for Travelsphere Limited. In February 2006 the results of the feasibility studies identified that the cost to comply with current maritime passenger safety regulations for seagoing vessels would be more expensive than building a replica.  The studies concluded that it would be more cost-effective to turn the ''City of Adelaide'' into a static exhibit. Edwards decided not to take up his original option of acquiring ''City of Adelaide'' but his charitable efforts had provided another three years of reprieve and a protective cover to shield the clipper from the elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cityofadelaide.org.au/history/clipper-s-history/2003-mike-edwards-proposal.html |title=Mike Edwards Proposal |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years the Scottish Maritime Museum was back in its original predicament, but the situation was worsened as the volunteer organisations that had previously been campaigning to acquire the ''City of Adelaide'' had now been on hiatus since 2003. The situation was further exacerbated as over the previous decade and a half, the Irvine River near the slipway had become heavily silted. Environmental regulations were now also more stringent, and the cost of dredging the river near sensitive bird breeding grounds and wetlands was thought to be unaffordable.  The ''City of Adelaide'' was therefore regarded as unrecoverable from the slipway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/our-news/our-news-articles/107-2013-news/811-final-departure-of-worlds-oldest-clipper-ship-from-scotland-18-september-2013.html |title=Final Departure of World's Oldest Clipper Ship from Scotland - 20 September 2013 |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006 the Scottish Maritime Museum applied again to North Ayrshire Council for consent to deconstruct the ship,&lt;ref name=NAC2006&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eplanning.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/OnlinePlanning/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=IZ3UNMLEQ0000 |title=Deconstruction of the clipper ship 'Carrick - City of Adelaide' |date = 10 May 2006  |publisher= North Ayrshire Council |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an estimated cost of £650,000.&lt;ref name=britpm/&gt; After the proposal was gazetted by the council 132 letters of objection were received, including representations from preservation groups in Sunderland and Australia, and from several Australian institutions.

On 18 April 2007 North Ayrshire Council approved the application to deconstruct of the clipper, subject to the approval of Historic Scotland.&lt;ref name=demolish&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/history/clipper-s-history/application-to-demolish.html |title=Application to Demolish |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just a few weeks later a major fire broke out on the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'', prompting a rethink on the future of the only other substantially surviving clipper ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Call to rethink clipper's future |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6676245.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=21 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rescue proposals===
[[File:Bus advertisement.jpg|thumb|right|Simulated bus advertisement used to promote an [[Internet petition|e-Petition]] to the British Prime Minister&lt;ref name=britpm/&gt;]]
The North Ayrshire Council decision prompted the South Australian organization '''Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Action Group''' to reform after being in hiatus since the 2003 Edwards proposal. Upon the subsequent news of the ''Cutty Sark'' fire, the Group's Peter Roberts and Peter Christopher highlighted that the fire made it critical to save the ''City of Adelaide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adelaide may rise from the ashes |url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/adelaide-may-rise-from-the-ashes/story-e6frea83-1111113591718 | work=The Advertiser |location=Adelaide | date=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group from Sunderland subsequently renewed calls to save the ship. The Sunderland City of Adelaide Recovery Foundation (SCARF) proposed to remove the vessel and store her on private land whilst working on plans to develop a maritime museum around the restored ''City of Adelaide''. The Scottish Maritime Museum stated that SCARF were welcome to take the ship should they have the money to save her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh bid to save historic ship  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6908814.stm | work = BBC News |date= 20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Save the City of Adelaide 1864 Action Group became formally constituted as '''Clipper Ship 'City of Adelaide' Ltd (CSCOAL)'''. The CSCOAL plan was to transport the ''City of Adelaide'' to [[Port Adelaide]] in South Australia in time for the state's 175th Jubilee in 2011. In March 2009 CSCOAL launched an e-petition on the [[10 Downing Street]] website, calling on the British Prime Minister to intervene to save the ''City of Adelaide'' and gift the ship &quot;to the people of South Australia&quot;.&lt;ref name=britpm&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cityofadelaide.org.au/our-news/our-news-articles/75-2009-news/235-british-pm-petition.html |title=British PM Petitioned to Save 'City of Adelaide' |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship|publisher= CSCOAL|date=16 March 2009 | accessdate = 15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal and state e-petitions were also launched in Australia. The former was later featured in an exhibition of &quot;Living Democracy&quot; at the Museum of Australian Democracy, Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cityofadelaide.org.au/component/content/article/66-support/petitions/229-museum-of-australian-democracy.html |title= Museum of Australian Democracy |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship | publisher = CSCOAL|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 an [[open letter]], signed by 66 eminent Australians, was sent to the British Prime Minister and the [[First Minister of Scotland]], urging them to prevent the demolition of the ''City of Adelaide''. Led by the Governor of South Australia, Rear Admiral [[Kevin Scarce]], other notable signatories included the current and four former [[Lord Mayor of Adelaide|Lord Mayors of Adelaide]]; former Australian Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]], national and state politicians including Senator [[Simon Birmingham]] (who was to figure prominently in the clipper's rescue later), [[Alexander Downer]], [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], and [[John Bannon]]; senior Australian Navy officers; academics; business figures and [[Australian Living Treasures]] Dr [[Basil Hetzel]], [[Jack Mundey]] and [[Julian Burnside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/aust-open-letter-to-uk.html |title=Australian Open Letter plea to UK Prime Minister to not destroy ''City of Adelaide'' |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship |publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:City of Adelaide clipper ship May 2009.jpg|thumb|right|''City of Adelaide'' in May 2009]]

Meanwhile, SCARF member and Sunderland councillor Peter Maddison sought to raise awareness through a four-day 'occupation' of the vessel in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8310621.stm |title=Lack of water ends ship protest |date=16 October 2009 | work =BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Maritime Museum called for tenders for the demolition or deconstruction of ''City of Adelaide'', which closed on 23 November 2009. Deconstruction of the vessel would involve scientific recording and potential preservation of sections of the ship.&lt;ref name=DTZ/&gt; CSCOAL submitted a tender, though unlike the other tenders its proposal involved removing the ship as a whole rather than in pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cityofadelaide.org.au/our-news/our-news-articles/75-2009-news/316-please-help-save-our-heritage.html | title =Campaign to save ''City of Adelaide'' |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship |publisher = CSCOAL |date=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Maritime Museum found itself in a [[Catch-22]] position: the punitive charges arising from their failure to vacate the slipway were now sufficient to bankrupt the museum, but they did not have sufficient funds to scientifically deconstruct the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =Gary | last = Noakes |title= Disposing of Ship Could Bankrupt Scots Museum |journal=Museums Journal |publisher=Museums Association | issue=110/02 | page = 5 | url = http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/01022010-ship-disposal-could-bankrupt-scots-museum | date = 1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had the museum gone into administration its nationally significant collection would have been dispersed. The alternative for the Scottish Government was to fund either the deconstruction of the ''City of Adelaide'', or her removal from Scotland. A conference was held in December 2009 at which the main stakeholders discussed the possible options for saving the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://cityofadelaide.org.au/our-news/our-news-articles/75-2009-news/323-hlf-funding-not-viable-for-uk-solution.html |title=HLF Funding not viable for UK Solution |work=City of Adelaide – the Splendid Clipper Ship | publisher = CSCOAL|date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Review of options===
In March 2010, in response to questions in the Scottish Parliament from [[Irene Oldfather]], MSP for [[Cunninghame South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Cunninghame South]] which includes Irvine, the Scottish [[Minister for Culture and External Affairs]] [[Fiona Hyslop]] said the Scottish Government was working closely with a number of stakeholders to explore realistic options for securing the future of the ''City of Adelaide'' and that Historic Scotland had commenced an assessment of these options. Hyslop said she had met a delegation from CSCOAL and had subsequently spoken to the South Australian Minister for Transport [[Patrick Conlon (politician)|Patrick Conlon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Minister considers options for the SV Carrick |publisher=Historic Scotland |date=5 March 2010 |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/news/news_article.htm?articleid=27145 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic Scotland's assessment looked at four options: deconstruction; removal elsewhere in Scotland; removal to Sunderland by SCARF; or removal to Australia by CSCOAL.&lt;ref name=HSoptions&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/news_article.htm?articleid=29161 |title=Culture Minister announces plan to save City of Adelaide/Carrick with Australian bidder |publisher=Historic Scotland |date=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The options appraisal was carried out by [[DTZ]] with advice from Sir [[Neil Cossons]], former Director of the [[National Maritime Museum]] and a former Chair of [[English Heritage]], with extensive experience in maritime heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Historic Scotland appoints DTZ to undertake options appraisal for Carrick |publisher=Historic Scotland |date=28 April 2010 |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/historic-scotland-appoints-dtz-to-undertake-options-appraisal-for-carrick-28-apr-10.html |accessdate=15 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James McLauchlan family 1889.jpg|thumb|right|James McLauchlan, author of the 1874 diary, with his family (c.1889)]]
In May 2010 Minister Hyslop accepted from Irene Oldfather a copy of a diary kept by James Anderson McLauchlan, a 21-year-old Scot who migrated to South Australia on ''City of Adelaide'' in 1874. The diary begins with his departure from Dundee, and his subsequent 80-day voyage to South Australia. The presentation was intended to highlight the importance of the ''City of Adelaide'' from the human perspective, and the experiences &quot;shared by thousands of other people who made the journey across the globe for a new life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Carrick diary reveals fascinating legacy|url=http://www.irvineherald.co.uk/ayrshire-news/local-news-ayrshire/local-news-irvine/2010/05/21/carrick-irvine-msp-backs-bid-to-save-historic-ship-75485-26474961/|work=Irvine Herald|date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010 The Duke of Edinburgh gave a rare radio interview reflecting on the 40th anniversary of the rescue of the {{SS|Great Britain}}, and commented on the hideous trap that ''City of Adelaide'' was in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prince Philip reflects on revival of SS Great Britain |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10492646 |publisher=BBC News |date=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyslop announced on 28 August 2010 that ''City of Adelaide'' would not be deconstructed, and that CSCOAL had been identified as the preferred bidder.&lt;ref name=HSoptions/&gt; The DTZ report identified the CSCOAL as the only feasible option which would not involve destruction of the ship. The CSCOAL bid was considered to meet the assessment criteria, despite some funding uncertainties. The rival bid from SCARF was not considered to be technically feasible, with significant risks identified in relation to funding and the expertise available to the SCARF team.&lt;ref name=DTZ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/cityofadelaidefinalreport2.9.10.pdf |title=Options Appraisal – The City of Adelaide |author=DTZ in association with Sir Neil Cossons |date=2 September 2010 |publisher=Historic Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs associated with transport to Australia were estimated at [[A$]]5 million.&lt;ref name=Homecoming&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/famed-clipper-adelaide-finally-coming-home-from-scotland/comments-e6frea83-1225911307313 |title=Famed clipper Adelaide finally coming home from Scotland |first=Renato |last=Castello |work=Adelaide Now |date=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunderland-based SCARF congratulated the Australian group but stated that their campaign to keep the ship in the United Kingdom would continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wear-11120374 |title=Blow to bid to bring 1864 ship home to Sunderland |publisher=BBC News |date=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project preliminaries===
[[File:City of Adelaide transfer to barge.jpg|thumb|''City of Adelaide'' being moved onto a barge after over 20 years on land]]
[[File:City of Adelaide on barge Sept 2013.jpg|thumb|''City of Adelaide'' on the transportation barge ready to leave Irvine, Scotland]]
A detailed [[bathymetric]] / [[hydrography|hydrographic]] survey of the [[River Irvine]] had been previously undertaken to develop the strategies for recovering the ''City of Adelaide'' from the riverbank. This was necessary as the river had silted up over the twenty years since the clipper was slipped.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;/&gt;

In advance of the vessel's removal, the Scottish Maritime Museum commissioned [[Headland Archaeology]] to undertake a detailed [[3D scanner#Cultural heritage|3D laser survey]] of ''City of Adelaide''. This serves as a detailed record of the ship, and enabled the transportation cradle to be designed and built with great precision in South Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.headlandarchaeology.com/Services/consultancy/maritime_case_studies/city_of_adelaide.html |title=City of Adelaide, Irvine: Laser Scanning |publisher=Headland Archaeology |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual tours of the inside and outside of the clipper were also created during the laser survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/Virtual-Tours/ |title=Virtual Tours |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship |publisher= CSCOAL |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early stage in the preparatory work involved cleaning and treatment of the timbers. This was completed by the Scottish Maritime Museum in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irvineherald.co.uk/ayrshire-news/local-news-ayrshire/local-news-irvine/2010/12/10/carrick-gets-ship-shape-for-oz-voyage-75485-27788488/ |title=Carrick gets ship-shape for Oz voyage  |first=Eric |last=McGowan |work=Irvine Herald |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation for transport to Australia===
In 2011, donor companies from across [[South Australia]] completed fabrication of CSCOAL's 100-tonne, [[A$]]1.2-million, steel cradle to be placed under the ship to move her. The first cradle components arrived at the Scottish Maritime Museum in January 2012 for assembly on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.irvineherald.co.uk/ayrshire-news/local-news-ayrshire/local-news-irvine/2012/01/13/carrick-ready-for-the-off-75485-30097942/ |title=Carrick ready for the off |first=Eric |last=McGowan |publisher=Irvine Herald |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The load lifting capacity of the cradle was certified on 23 March 2012 in readiness for assembly under the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/the-project/transportation.html |title=Transportation |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship |publisher= CSCOAL|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February 2012 protestors from Sunderland-based SCARF again occupied the ship in an attempt to prevent her removal to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-17174721 |title=City of Adelaide clipper ship occupied by campaigner |publisher= BBC News |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrelated to the SCARF protest, a delay to the project of nearly a year occurred as the Scottish Maritime Museum went through protracted negotiations with the slipway owners for access to their land to enable the removal of the clipper.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, CSCOAL utilised the delay by shipping the clipper's timber rudder to South Australia as the [[Pathfinder (RAF)|'pathfinder']] to explore and test Customs and Quarantine-related issues with respect to exporting from the UK, and importing into Australia.  The rudder arrived in Adelaide in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/our-news/our-news-articles/80-2012-news/800-rudder-arrives.html|title=Rudder Arrives - 17 December 2012 |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship |publisher= CSCOAL |date=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rudder had been built at [[Fletchers Slip]] in South Australia after the original was lost in a storm in South Australian waters in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/the-ship/the-rudder.html|title=The Rudder |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship |publisher= CSCOAL |date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunderland-based SCARF threatened legal action towards CSCOAL, and built a wooden replica rudder as a protest.

The access agreement between the Scottish Maritime Museum and the slipway owners was resolved in March 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;trans&quot;/&gt; Immediately CSCOAL sent a project manager, Richard Smith, to Scotland to manage the activity that commenced a couple of weeks later of disassembling the cradle, and reassembling it beneath and around the clipper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityofadelaide.org.au/our-news/our-news-articles/107-2013-news/802-work-starts-in-scotland.html|title=Work starts in Scotland - 9 April 2013 |work=City of Adelaide - the Splendid Clipper Ship |publisher= CSCOAL |date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual transport of ''City of Adelaide'' from Scotland to South Australia started in September 2013, when the clipper on her cradle was transferred using [[self-propelled modular transporter]]s to a barge for transport to [[Chatham, Kent]]. On 20 September 2013 ''City of Adelaide'' left the Irvine River aboard the barge towed by the tug ''Dutch Pioneer'', and entered open water, commencing her journey south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Historic clipper City of Adelaide 'floats again' for first time since 1991|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24009434|accessdate=8 September 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''City of Adelaide'' arrived at [[Chatham Docks]] on 25 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityofadelaide.org.au/our-news/our-news-articles/107-2013-news/815-city-of-adelaide-arrives-at-chatham-25-september-2013.html City of Adelaide arrives at Chatham - 25 September 2013 ] CSCOAL press release. Retrieved 3 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the South Australian media reported that the departure to Australia could not be confirmed. A [[Australian federal election, 2013|federal election]] on 7 September had led to a change in government, and in the meantime the funding to cover the journey to Australia had not been approved. CSCOAL were briefly left &quot;in limbo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/historic-city-of-adelaide-clipper-ship-journey-home-to-sa-in-limbo-over-heritage-assessment/story-fnii5yv7-1226730337252 |title=Historic City of Adelaide clipper ship journey home to SA in limbo over heritage assessment |work=Herald Sun |date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CSCOAL arranged for the vessel to be towed upstream to Greenwich, and moored near ''Cutty Sark'', a few days ahead of a ceremony on 18 October at which HRH the Duke of Edinburgh formally renamed ''Carrick'' as ''City of Adelaide''.&lt;ref name=ceremony&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/local/all-news/prince-philip-renames-sunderland-s-historic-adelaide-clipper-ahead-of-trip-down-under-1-6165787 |title=Prince Philip renames Sunderland’s historic Adelaide clipper ahead of trip Down Under |work=Sunderland Echo |date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day prior the ceremony, the Australian Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment [[Simon Birmingham]], announced the Australian Government had approved the grant of A$850,000 enabling transport arrangements to be made to move the ship from the UK to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Government confirms it will provide $850,000 for the City of Adelaide clipper ship's journey to Largs North|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/federal-government-confirms-it-will-provide-850000-for-the-city-of-adelaide-clipper-ship8217s-journey-to-largs-north/story-fnii5yv4-1226741806534|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=Portside Messenger|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of SCARF staged a protest on the day of the ceremony, and stated that they were seeking an export ban which would prevent removal of the ship from the UK.&lt;ref name = ceremony /&gt;

After arriving at Berth 18 in the [[Port River]] on 3 February, ''City of Adelaide'' was craned from ''Palanpur'' onto the 800&amp;nbsp;tonne barge ''Bradley''. This was a lengthy operation due to the need to &quot;skid&quot; the 450&amp;nbsp;tonne vessel and her 100&amp;nbsp;tonne cradle across the deck of ''Palanpur'' between the ship's cranes before she could be off-loaded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portside2014-02-05&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/messenger/west-beaches/new-time-of-arrival-for-city-of-adelaide-at-temporary-home-in-dock-one-at-port-adelaide/story-fni9llx9-1226817878608 | title = New time of arrival for City of Adelaide at temporary home in Dock One at Port Adelaide | newspaper = Adelaide Now | date = 5 February 2014 | accessdate = 6 February 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/messenger/west-beaches/city-of-adelaide-clipper-finally-finds-safe-harbour/story-fni9llx9-1226819993894 | title = City of Adelaide clipper finally finds safe harbour | newspaper = Adelaide Now | date = 6 February 2014 | accessdate = 7 February 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
