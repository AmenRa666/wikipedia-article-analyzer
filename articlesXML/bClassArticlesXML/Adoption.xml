[[File:Children at New York Foundling cph.3a23917.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sister Irene]] of New York Foundling Hospital with children. Sister Irene is among the pioneers of modern adoption, establishing a system to board out children rather than institutionalize them.]]
'''Adoption''' is a process whereby a person assumes the [[parenting]] of another, usually a child, and or animal from that person's biological or legal parent or parents, and, in so doing, permanently transfers all [[rights]] and responsibilities, along with [[filiation]], from the biological parent or parents. Unlike [[guardianship]] or other systems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a permanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either through legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption; where others have tried to achieve adoption through less formal means, notably via contracts that specified [[inheritance]] rights and [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental responsibilities]] without an accompanying transfer of [[filiation]]. Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive [[statutes]] and regulations.

==History==

===Antiquity===
;Adoption for the well-born
[[File:Traianus Glyptothek Munich 336.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Trajan]] became emperor of Rome through adoption by the previous emperor [[Nerva]], and was in turn succeeded by his own adopted son [[Hadrian]].   Adoption was a customary practice of the Roman empire that enabled peaceful transitions of power]]
While the modern form of adoption emerged in the United States, forms of the practice appeared throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Melosh, ''[http://www.dadpeter.co.uk: the American Way of Adoption]'' page 10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Code of Hammurabi]], for example, details the rights of adopters and the responsibilities of adopted individuals at length. The practice of [[adoption in ancient Rome]] is well documented in the [[Codex Justinianus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp Code of Hammurabi]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/535institutes.html Codex Justinianus]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Markedly different from the modern period, ancient adoption practices put emphasis on the political and economic interests of the adopter,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Psychology of Adoption&quot;&gt;Brodzinsky and Schecter (editors), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7WQp2uEnogoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA274,M1 The Psychology of Adoption]'', 1990, page 274&lt;/ref&gt; providing a legal tool that strengthened political ties between wealthy families and created male heirs to manage estates.&lt;ref&gt;H. David Kirk, Adoptive Kinship: A Modern Institution in Need of Reform, 1985, page xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary Kathleen Benet 1976, page 14&quot;&gt;Mary Kathleen Benet, The Politics of Adoption, 1976, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of adoption by the aristocracy is well documented; many of Rome's emperors were adopted sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary Kathleen Benet 1976, page 14&quot;/&gt;

Infant adoption during Antiquity appears rare.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Psychology of Adoption&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1D29F0yyQC The Kindness of Strangers]'', 1998, page 74, 115&lt;/ref&gt; [[child abandonment|Abandoned children]] were often picked up for slavery&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1D29F0yyQC The Kindness of Strangers]'', 1998, page 62-63&lt;/ref&gt; and composed a significant percentage of the Empire's slave supply.&lt;ref&gt;W. Scheidel, The Roman Slave Supply, May 2007, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1D29F0yyQC The Kindness of Strangers]'', 1998, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman legal records indicate that foundlings were occasionally taken in by families and raised as a son or daughter. Although not normally adopted under Roman Law, the children, called ''[[alumni]]'', were reared in an arrangement similar to guardianship, being considered the property of the father who abandoned them.&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1D29F0yyQC The Kindness of Strangers]'', 1998, page 53-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient civilizations, notably India and China, used some form of adoption as well. Evidence suggests the goal of this practice was to ensure the continuity of cultural and religious practices; in contrast to the Western idea of extending family lines. In [[History of India|ancient India]], secondary sonship, clearly denounced by the [[Rigveda]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Tiwari, The Hindu Law of Adoption, Central Indian Law Quarterly, ''[http://www.cili.in/article/view/2164/1452 Vol 18, 2005]''&lt;/ref&gt; continued, in a limited and highly ritualistic form, so that an adopter might have the necessary [[funerary rites]] performed by a son.&lt;ref&gt;Vinita Bhargava, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9z0GsuuhLDUC Adoption in India: Policies and Experiences]'', 2005, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; China had a similar idea of adoption with males adopted solely to perform the duties of ancestor worship.&lt;ref&gt;W. Menski, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s7ohU5v8Lu8C Comparative Law in a Global Context: The Legal Systems of Asia and Africa]'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of adopting the children of family members and close friends was common among the [[Polynesian culture|cultures of Polynesia]] including [[Ancient Hawaii|Hawaii]] where the custom was referred to as ''[[hānai]]''.

===Middle Ages to modern period===
;Adoption and commoners

[[File:Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller 003.jpg|left|thumb| ''At the monastery gate'' (''Am Klostertor'') by [[Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller]]]]
The nobility of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Celts|Celtic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] cultures that dominated Europe after the decline of the [[Roman Empire]] denounced the practice of adoption.&lt;ref&gt;S. Finley-Croswhite, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_199708/ai_n8758613/print?tag=artBody;col1 Review of Blood Ties and Fictive Ties, Canadian Journal of History], August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In [[medieval]] society, [[bloodline]]s were paramount; a ruling dynasty lacking a natural-born [[heir apparent]] was replaced, a stark contrast to Roman traditions. The evolution of European law reflects this aversion to adoption. English [[Common Law]], for instance, did not permit adoption since it contradicted the customary rules of inheritance. In the same vein, France's [[Napoleonic Code]] made adoption difficult, requiring adopters to be over the age of 50, sterile, older than the adopted person by at least fifteen years, and to have fostered the adoptee for at least six years.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Brodzinsky and Schecter (editors), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7WQp2uEnogoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA274,M1 The Psychology of Adoption], 1990, page 274&lt;/ref&gt;  Some adoptions continued to occur, however, but became informal, based on ad hoc contracts. For example, in the year 737, in a charter from the town of [[Lucca]], three adoptees were made heirs to an estate. Like other contemporary arrangements, the agreement stressed the responsibility of the adopted rather than adopter, focusing on the fact that, under the contract, the adoptive father was meant to be cared for in his old age; an idea that is similar to the conceptions of adoption under Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1D29F0yyQC The Kindness of Strangers]'', 1998, page 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe's cultural makeover marked a period of significant innovation for adoption. Without support from the nobility, the practice gradually shifted toward abandoned children. Abandonment levels rose with the fall of the empire and many of the foundlings were left on the doorstep of the [[Catholic Church|Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Kindness of Strangers&quot;&gt;John Boswell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1D29F0yyQC The Kindness of Strangers], 1998, page 184&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the clergy reacted by drafting rules to govern the exposing, selling, and rearing of abandoned children. The Church's innovation, however, was the practice of [[oblation]], whereby children were dedicated to lay life within monastic institutions and reared within a [[monastery]]. This created the first system in European history in which abandoned children did not have legal, social, or moral disadvantages. As a result, many of Europe's abandoned and orphaned children became [[alumni]] of the Church, which in turn took the role of adopter. Oblation marks the beginning of a shift toward [[institutionalization]], eventually bringing about the establishment of the [[foundling hospital]] and [[orphanage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Kindness of Strangers&quot;/&gt;

As the idea of institutional care gained acceptance, formal rules appeared about how to place children into families: boys could become apprenticed to an [[artisan]] and girls might be married off under the institution's authority.&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1D29F0yyQC The Kindness of Strangers]'', 1998, page 420&lt;/ref&gt;  Institutions informally adopted out children as well, a mechanism treated as a way to obtain cheap [[Child labor|labor]], demonstrated by the fact that when the adopted died, their bodies were returned by the family to the institution for burial.&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MR1D29F0yyQC The Kindness of Strangers]'', 1998, page 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

This system of [[apprenticeship]] and informal adoption extended into the 19th century, today seen as a transitional phase for adoption history. Under the direction of social welfare activists, orphan asylums began to promote adoptions based on sentiment rather than work; children were placed out under agreements to provide care for them as family members instead of under contracts for apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Carp, Editor, Adoption in America, article by: Susan Porter, A Good Home, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gVnx_ymDu6wC&amp;printsec=frontcover A Good Home]'', page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of this model is believed to have contributed to the enactment of the first modern adoption law in 1851 by the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]], unique in that it codified the ideal of the &quot;best interests of the child.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Carp, Editor, Adoption in America, article by: Susan Porter, A Good Home, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gVnx_ymDu6wC&amp;printsec=frontcover A Good Home]'', page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Topic: Timeline&quot;&gt;Ellen Herman, Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, [http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/timeline.html Topic: Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;   Despite its intent, though, in practice, the system operated much the same as earlier incarnations. The experience of the [[Boston Female Asylum]] (BFA) is a good example, which had up to 30% of its charges adopted out by 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Carp, Editor, Adoption in America, article by: Susan Porter, A Good Home, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gVnx_ymDu6wC&amp;printsec=frontcover A Good Home]'', page 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Officials of the BFA noted that, although the asylum promoted otherwise, adoptive parents did not distinguish between indenture and adoption; &quot;We believe,&quot; the asylum officials said, &quot;that often, when children of a younger age are taken to be adopted, the adoption is only another name for service.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Carp, Editor, Adoption in America, article by: Susan Porter, A Good Home, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gVnx_ymDu6wC&amp;printsec=frontcover A Good Home]'', page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period===
;Adopting to create a family

The next stage of adoption's evolution fell to the emerging nation of the United States. Rapid immigration and the [[American Civil War]] resulted in unprecedented overcrowding of orphanages and foundling homes in the mid-nineteenth century. [[Charles Loring Brace]], a Protestant minister became appalled by the legions of homeless [[waif]]s roaming the streets of New York City. Brace considered the abandoned youth, particularly Catholics, to be the most dangerous element challenging the city's order.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Herman, Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, [http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/archive/BraceDCNY.htm Topic: Charles Loring Brace, The Dangerous Classes of New York and Twenty Years' Work Among Them, 1872]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loring Brace, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gKg4ZsexZPIC The Dangerous Classes of New York and Twenty Years' Work Among Them], 1872&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:CharlesLoringBrace.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Charles Loring Brace]]]]
His solution was outlined in ''The Best Method of Disposing of Our Pauper and Vagrant Children'' (1859) which started the [[Orphan Train]] movement. The orphan trains eventually shipped an estimated 200,000 children from the urban centers of the East to the nation's rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Herman, Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, [http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/people/brace.html Topic: Charles Loring Brace]&lt;/ref&gt; The children were generally [[indentured]], rather than adopted, to families who took them in.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen O'Connor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMUlOcn61q4C Orphan Trains], Page 95&lt;/ref&gt; As in times past, some children were raised as members of the family while others were used as farm laborers and household servants.&lt;ref&gt;Orphan Train Heritage Society of America, [http://www.orphantrainriders.com/riders11.html Riders' Stories]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Orphan Train William Thomas.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William and his brother Thomas. They rode the Orphan Train in 1880 at the ages of 11 and 9, respectively. William was taken into a good home. Thomas was exploited for labor and abused. The brothers eventually made their way back to New York and reunited.]]
The sheer size of the displacement—the largest migration of children in history—and the degree of exploitation that occurred, gave rise to new agencies and a series of laws that promoted adoption arrangements rather than indenture. The hallmark of the period is [[Minnesota]]'s adoption law of 1917 which mandated investigation of all placements and limited record access to those involved in the adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Carp (Editor), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gVnx_ymDu6wC E. Adoption in America: Historical Perspectives], page 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Herman, Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, [http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/homestudies.htm Topic: Home Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, the [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive]] movement swept the United States with a critical goal of ending the prevailing orphanage system. The culmination of such efforts came with the First White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children called by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;M. Gottlieb, The Foundling, 2001, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; where it was declared that the nuclear family represented &quot;the highest and finest product of civilization&quot; and was best able to serve as primary caretaker for the abandoned and orphaned.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wayne Carp (Editor), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gVnx_ymDu6wC Adoption in America: Historical Perspectives], page 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Herman, Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, [http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/placingout.html Topic: Placing Out]&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-institutional forces gathered momentum. As late as 1923, only two percent of children without parental care were in adoptive homes, with the balance in foster arrangements and orphanages. Less than forty years later, nearly one-third were in an adoptive home.&lt;ref&gt;Bernadine Barr, &quot;Spare Children, 1900–1945: Inmates of Orphanages as Subjects of Research in Medicine and in the Social Sciences in America&quot; (PhD diss., Stanford University, 1992), p. 32, figure 2.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the popularity of [[eugenic]] ideas in America put up obstacles to the growth of adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Herman, Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, [http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/eugenics.htm Topic: Eugenics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence and Pat
Starkey, [https://books.google.com/books?id=him8GwThlAUC Child Welfare and Social Action in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries], 2001 page 223&lt;/ref&gt; There were grave concerns about the genetic quality of illegitimate and indigent children, perhaps best exemplified by the influential writings of [[Henry H. Goddard]] who protested against adopting children of unknown origin, saying,

{{quotation|Now it happens that some people are interested in the welfare and high development of the human race; but leaving aside those exceptional people, all fathers and mothers are interested in the welfare of their own families. The dearest thing to the parental heart is to have the children marry well and rear a noble family. How short-sighted it is then for such a family to take into its midst a child whose pedigree is absolutely unknown; or, where, if it were partially known, the probabilities are strong that it would show poor and diseased stock, and that if a marriage should take place between that individual and any member of the family the offspring would be degenerates.&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Goddard, [http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/archive/GoddardWCA.htm Excerpt from Wanted: A Child to Adopt]&lt;/ref&gt;}} The period 1945 to 1974, the [[Baby Scoop Era|baby scoop era]], saw rapid growth and acceptance of adoption as a means to build a family.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wayne Carp (Editor), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gVnx_ymDu6wC Adoption in America: Historical Perspectives], page 181&lt;/ref&gt; Illegitimate births rose three-fold after World War II, as [[Sexual revolution|sexual mores]] changed. Simultaneously, the scientific community began to stress the dominance of nurture over genetics, chipping away at eugenic stigmas.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Mosher and Christine A. Bachrach, [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2800496.html Understanding U.S. Fertility: Continuity and Change in the National Survey of Family Growth, 1988–1995], Family Planning Perspectives Volume 28, Number 1, January/February 1996, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Melosh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mM_meNTALDkC Strangers and Kin: the American Way of Adoption], page 106&lt;/ref&gt; In this environment, adoption became the obvious solution for both unwed mothers and infertile couples.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Melosh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mM_meNTALDkC Strangers and Kin: the American Way of Adoption], page 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together, these trends resulted in a new American model for adoption. Following its Roman predecessor, Americans severed the rights of the original parents while making adopters the new parents in the eyes of the law. Two innovations were added: 1) adoption was meant to ensure the &quot;best interests of the child;&quot; the seeds of this idea can be traced to the first American adoption law in [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Topic: Timeline&quot;/&gt; and 2) adoption became infused with secrecy, eventually resulting in the sealing of adoption and original birth records by 1945. The origin of the move toward secrecy began with Charles Loring Brace who introduced it to prevent children from the Orphan Trains from returning to or being reclaimed by their parents. Brace feared the impact of the parents' poverty, in general, and their Catholic religion, in particular, on the youth. This tradition of secrecy was carried on by the later Progressive reformers when drafting of American laws.&lt;ref&gt;E. Wayne Carp, Family Matters: Secrecy and Disclosure in the History of Adoption, Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of adoptions in the United States peaked in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;National Council for Adoption, Adoption Fact Book, 2000, page 42, Table 11&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain what caused the subsequent decline. Likely contributing factors in the 1960s and 1970s include a decline in the fertility rate, associated with the introduction of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], the completion of legalization of [[birth control|artificial birth control]] methods, the introduction of [[Title X|federal funding]] to make [[family planning]] services available to the young and low income, and the legalization of abortion. In addition, the years of the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a dramatic change in society's view of [[illegitimacy]] and in the legal rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Supreme Court Cases from Justia &amp;amp; Oyez|url=http://supreme.justia.com/constitution/amendment-14/90-illegitimacy.html|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of those born outside of wedlock. In response, [[family preservation]] efforts grew&lt;ref&gt;M. Gottlieb, The Foundling, 2001, page 106&lt;/ref&gt; so that few children born out of wedlock today are adopted. Ironically, adoption is far more visible and discussed in society today, yet it is less common.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Herman, Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, [http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/adoptionstatistics.htm Topic: Adoption Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The American model of adoption eventually proliferated globally. [[England and Wales]] established their first formal adoption law in 1926. The [[Netherlands]] passed its law in 1956. [[Sweden]] made adoptees full members of the family in 1959. [[West Germany]] enacted its first laws in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Adamec and William Pierce, The Encyclopedia of Adoption, 2nd Edition, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Asian powers opened their orphanage systems to adoption, influenced as they were by Western ideas following colonial rule and military occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Herman, Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, [http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/internationaladoption.htm Topic: International Adoption]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although adoption is today practiced globally, the United States has the largest number of children adopted per 100 live births. The table below provides a snapshot of Western adoption rates. Adoption in the United States still occurs at nearly three times those of its peers although the number of children awaiting adoption has held steady in recent years, hovering between 133,000 and 129,000 during the period 2002 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/resource/trends-in-foster-care-and-adoption U.S. Trends in Foster Care and Adoption]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary adoption==

===Forms of adoption===
Contemporary adoption practices can be open or closed.
* [[Open adoption]] allows identifying information to be communicated between adoptive and biological parents and, perhaps, interaction between kin and the adopted person.&lt;ref&gt;What is Open Adoption? http://adoption.com/wiki/What_is_Open_Adoption%3F&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, it is the outgrowth of laws that maintain an adoptee's right to unaltered birth certificates and/or adoption records, but such access is not universal (it is possible in a few jurisdictions—including the UK and six states in the United States).&lt;ref name=&quot;Donaldson&quot;&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07316/833100-84.stm Retrieved 29 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unsealedinitiative.org/html/articles.html Accessed: 2 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://apostille.us/news/bill_looks_to_open_adoption_records.shtml Accessed: 2 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://adoption.about.com/od/adoptionrights/a/openingrecords.htm Accessed: 2 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Open adoption can be an informal arrangement subject to termination by adoptive parents who have sole authority over the child. In some jurisdictions, the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a legally enforceable and binding agreement concerning visitation, exchange of information, or other interaction regarding the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Postadoption Contact Agreements Between Birth and Adoptive Families |year=2005 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Children's Bureau |url=http://childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/cooperative.cfm |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2009, 24 U.S. states allowed legally enforceable open adoption contract agreements to be included in the adoption finalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Postadoption Contact Agreements Between Birth and Adoptive Families: Summary of State Laws |year=2009 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, Children's Bureau |url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/cooperativeall.pdf |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The practice of [[closed adoption]] (aka confidential or secret adoption),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allforchildren.org/pregnant/choose-adoptive-family.php&lt;/ref&gt; which has not been the norm for most of modern history,&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Herman, Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, [http://www.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/confidentiality.htm Topic: Confidentiality]&lt;/ref&gt; seals all identifying information, maintaining it as secret and preventing disclosure of the adoptive parents', biological kins', and adoptees' identities. Nevertheless, closed adoption may allow the transmittal of non-identifying information such as medical history and religious and ethnic background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethany.org/A55798/bethanyWWW.nsf/0/BA94676902EC1CDE85256CE10073B4E8 Bethany Christian Services]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, as a result of [[safe haven law]]s passed by some U.S. states, secret adoption is seeing renewed influence. In so-called &quot;safe-haven&quot; states, infants can be left, anonymously, at hospitals, fire departments, or police stations within a few days of birth, a practice criticized by some adoption advocacy organizations as being retrograde and dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopdumpingkids.com SECA Organization]&lt;/ref&gt; Closed adoption, lack of medical history and the broken thread of family continuity can have a detrimental impact on an adoptee's psychological and physical health. The lack of openness, honesty and family connections in adoption can be detrimental to the psychological well being of adoptees and of their descendants.

===How adoptions originate===
[[File:Entrance to the New York Foundling Home.jpg|thumb|right|The [[The New York Foundling|New York Foundling Home]] is among North America's oldest adoption agencies]]

Adoptions can occur either between related family members, or unrelated individuals. Historically, most adoptions occurred within a family. The most recent data from the U.S. indicates about half of adoptions are currently between related individuals.&lt;ref&gt;National Council For Adoption, Adoption Factbook, 2000, Table 11&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of this is a &quot;stepparent adoption&quot;, where the new partner of a parent may legally adopt a child from the parent's previous relationship. Intra-family adoption can also occur through surrender, as a result of parental death, or when the child cannot otherwise be cared for and a family member agrees to take over.

[[Infertility]] is the main reason parents seek to adopt children they are not related to. One study shows this accounted for 80% of unrelated infant adoptions and half of adoptions through foster care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/q0nh2715217r1287/ M. Berry, Preparation, Support and Satisfaction of Adoptive Families in Agency and Independent Adoptions, at pg. 166, Table 2, Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal, Vol. 13, No. 2 (April 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates suggest that 11–24% of Americans who cannot conceive or carry to term attempt to build a family through adoption, and that the overall rate of ever-married American women who adopt is about 1.4%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2800496.html William D. Mosher and Christine A. Bachrach, Understanding U.S. Fertility: Continuity and Change in the National Survey of Family Growth, 1988–1995 Family Planning Perspectives Volume 28, Number 1, January/February 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_027.pdf U.S. Center for Disease Control, &quot;Adoption Experience of Women and Men and Demand for Children to Adopt in the U.S. page 19, August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons people adopt are numerous although not well documented. These may include wanting to cement a new family following divorce or death of one parent, compassion motivated by religious or philosophical conviction, to avoid contributing to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] out of the belief that it is more responsible to care for otherwise parent-less children than to reproduce, to ensure that inheritable diseases (e.g., [[Tay-Sachs disease]]) are not passed on, and health concerns relating to pregnancy and childbirth. Although there are a range of possible reasons, the most recent study of experiences of women who adopt suggests they are most likely to be 40–44 years of age, currently married, have impaired fertility, and childless.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_027.pdf U.S. Center for Disease Control, &quot;Adoption Experience of Women and Men and Demand for Children to Adopt in the U.S., page 8, August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrelated adoptions may occur through the following mechanisms:
* Private [[domestic adoption]]s: under this arrangement, charities and for-profit organizations act as intermediaries, bringing together prospective adoptive parents and families who want to place a child, all parties being residents of the same country. Alternatively, prospective adoptive parents sometimes avoid intermediaries and connect with women directly, often with a written contract; this is not permitted in some jurisdictions. Private domestic adoption accounts for a significant portion of all adoptions; in the United States, for example, nearly 45% of adoptions are estimated to have been arranged privately.&lt;ref name=&quot;childwelfare.gov&quot;/&gt;[[File:&quot;Надія і житло для дітей&quot; в Україні.jpg|thumb|Children associated with ''Hope and Homes for Children'', a foster care program in [[Ukraine]]]]
* [[Foster care adoption]]: this is a type of domestic adoption where a child is initially placed in public care. Its importance as an avenue for adoption varies by country. Of the 127,500 adoptions in the U.S. in 2000&lt;ref name=&quot;childwelfare.gov&quot;&gt;[https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/s_adopted.pdf#page=6&amp;view=Findings:%20Children%20Adopted US Child Welfare Information Gateway: How Many Children Were Adopted in 2000 and 2001?]&lt;/ref&gt; about 51,000 or 40% were through the foster care system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/stats_research/afcars/trends.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926180012/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/stats_research/afcars/tar/report1/ar0199.htm |archivedate=26 September 2006 |df=dmy }} US Child Welfare Information Gateway: Trends in Foster Care and Adoption&lt;/ref&gt; The main online agency used by the Children's Bureau&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb Children's Bureau | Administration for Children and Families&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; to offer kids available for adoption in the foster care is AdoptUSKids.org.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adoptuskids.org/ AdoptUSKids&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International adoption]]: involves the placing of a child for adoption outside that child's country of birth. This can occur through both public and private agencies. In some countries, such as Sweden, these adoptions account for the majority of cases (see above Table). The U.S. example, however, indicates there is wide variation by country since adoptions from abroad account for less than 15% of its cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;childwelfare.gov&quot;/&gt; More than 60,000 Russian children have been adopted in the United States since 1992,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-adv/advertisers/russia/articles/society/20090624/who_will_adopt_the_orphans.html Who Will Adopt the Orphans?]&quot;. The Washington Post.&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar number of Chinese children were adopted from 1995 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/04/03/adopted_chinese_orphans_often_have_special_needs/ Adopted Chinese orphans often have special needs]&quot;. The Boston Globe. 3 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of different countries vary in their willingness to allow international adoptions. Recognizing the difficulties and challenges associated with international adoption, and in an effort to protect those involved from the corruption and exploitation which sometimes accompanies it, the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] developed the [[Hague Adoption Convention]], which came into force on 1 May 1995 and has been ratified by 85 countries as of November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Countries ratifying or acceding to the Hague Convention: Available: http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=69 Accessed: 20 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Embryo donation|Embryo adoption]]: based on the donation of embryos remaining after one couple's [[in vitro fertilization]] treatments have been completed; embryos are given to another individual or couple, followed by the placement of those embryos into the recipient woman's uterus, to facilitate pregnancy and childbirth. In the United States, embryo adoption is governed by property law rather than by the court systems, in contrast to traditional adoption.
* Common law adoption: this is an adoption which has not been recognized beforehand by the [[court of law|courts]], but where a parent, without resorting to any formal [[legal process]], leaves his or her children with a friend or relative for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;GVB&quot;&gt;''The International Law on the Rights of the Child'' (book),Geraldine Van Bueren, 1998, p.95, ISBN 90-411-1091-7, web: [https://books.google.com/books?id=xEAmkaqn8lMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95 Books-Google-81MC].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JG&quot;&gt;''The best interests of the child: the least detrimental'' ''alternative'' (book), Joseph Goldstein, 1996, p.16, web:[https://books.google.com/books?id=cTLomwSIaHkC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16 Books-Google-HkC].
&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of a designated term of (voluntary) [[co-habitation]], as witnessed by the public, the adoption is then considered binding, in some courts of law, even though not initially sanctioned by the court. The particular terms of a common-law adoption are defined by each legal [[jurisdiction]]. For example, the US state of California recognizes [[common law]] relationships after co-habitation of 2 years. The practice is called &quot;private fostering&quot; in Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEC&quot;&gt;[http://www.privatefostering.org.uk/ Somebody Else's Child]&lt;/ref&gt;

===How adoptions can disrupt===
{{main article|Disruption (adoption)}}
[[Disruption (adoption)|Disruption]] refers to the termination of an adoption. This includes adoptions that end prior to legal finalization and those that end after that point (in U.S. law, the latter cases are referred to as having been [[dissolution (law)|dissolved]]). The Disruption process is usually initiated by adoptive parents via a [[court]] [[petition]] and is analogous to divorce proceedings. It is a legal avenue unique to adoptive parents as disruption/dissolution does not apply to biological kin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adoption Disruption and Dissolution&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Child Welfare Information Gateway, [http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/s_disrup.pdf Adoption Disruption and Dissolution], December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ad hoc'' studies, performed in the U.S., however, suggest that between 10 and 25 percent of adoptions disrupt before they are legally finalized and from 1 to 10 percent are dissolved after legal finalization. The wide range of values reflects the paucity of information on the subject and demographic factors such as age; it is known that older children are more prone to having their adoptions disrupted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adoption Disruption and Dissolution&quot;/&gt;

===Adoption by same-sex couples in the U.S.===

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;In Estonia a law will come into force in 2016.&lt;/small&gt;]]
As of May 2012, adoption by same-sex couples was legal in at least some jurisdictions of about twenty states in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf IGLA, &quot;State-sponsored Homophobia&quot;, May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parenting and development of adoptees==

===Parenting===
The biological relationship between a parent and child is important, and the separation of the two has led to concerns about adoption. The traditional view of adoptive parenting received empirical support from a [[Princeton University]] study of 6,000 adoptive, step, and foster families in the United States and South Africa from 1968 to 1985; the study indicated that food expenditures in households with mothers of non-biological children (when controlled for income, household size, hours worked, age, etc.) were significantly less for adoptees, step-children, and foster children, causing the researchers to speculate that, instinctually, people are less interested in sustaining the genetic lines of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Case | first1 = A.| last2 = Lin | first2 = I. F.| last3 = McLanahan | first3 = S.| title = How Hungry is the Selfish Gene?| journal = The Economic Journal| volume = 110| issue = 466| pages = 781–804| year = 2000| doi = 10.1111/1468-0297.00565| url = http://www.princeton.edu/~accase/downloads/How_Hungry_Is_the_Selfish_Gene.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory is supported in another more qualitative study where in adoptive relationships marked by sameness in likes, personality, and appearance, both adult adoptees and adoptive parents report being happier with the adoption.&lt;ref&gt;L. Raynor, The Adopted Child Comes of Age, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies provide evidence that adoptive relationships can form along other lines. A study evaluating the level of parental investment indicates strength in adoptive families, suggesting that parents who adopt invest more time in their children than other parents and concludes, &quot;...adoptive parents enrich their children's lives to compensate for the lack of biological ties and the extra challenges of adoption.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Laura |title=Adoptive Parents, Adaptive Parents: Evaluating the Importance of Biological Ties for Parental Investment|work=American Sociological Review |publisher=American Sociological Review |url=http://www.asanet.org/galleries/default-file/Feb07ASRAdoption.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=3 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221194844/http://www.asanet.org/galleries/default-file/Feb07ASRAdoption.pdf |archivedate = 21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent study found that adoptive families invested more heavily in their adopted children, for example, by providing further education and financial support. Noting that adoptees seemed to be more likely to experience problems such as drug addiction, the study speculated that adoptive parents might invest more in adoptees not because they favor them, but because they are more likely than genetic children to need the help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Gibson | first1 = K.| title = Differential parental investment in families with both adopted and genetic children| journal = [[Evolution and Human Behavior]]| volume = 30| issue = 3| pages = 184–189| year = 2009| doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists' findings regarding the importance of early mother-infant bonding created some concern about whether parents who adopt older infants or toddlers after birth have missed some crucial period for the child's development. However, research on [[The Mental and Social Life of Babies]] suggested that the &quot;parent-infant system,&quot; rather than a bond between biologically related individuals, is an evolved fit between innate behavior patterns of all human infants and equally evolved responses of human adults to those infant behaviors. Thus nature &quot;ensures some initial flexibility with respect to the particular adults who take on the parental role.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaye|first=K|title=The Mental and Social Life of Babies|year=1982|publisher=Univ. Chicago Press|isbn=0226428486|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the foundational issues, the unique questions posed for adoptive parents are varied. They include how to respond to stereotypes, answering questions about heritage, and how best to maintain connections with biological kin when in an open adoption.&lt;ref&gt;A. Adesman and C. Adamec, Parenting Your Adopted Child, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  One author suggests a common question adoptive parents have is: &quot;Will we love the child even though he/she is not our biological child?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michaels, Ruth, and Florence Rondell. The Adoption Family Book I: You and Your Child. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  A specific concern for many parents is accommodating an adoptee in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adoptionfilm.com/video.html Adoption: An American Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar lessons like &quot;draw your [[family tree]]&quot; or &quot;trace your eye color back through your parents and grandparents to see where your genes come from&quot; could be hurtful to children who were adopted and do not know this biological information. Numerous suggestions have been made to substitute new lessons, e.g., focusing on &quot;family orchards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.familyhelper.net/ad/adteach.html Robin Hillborn, Teacher's Guide to Adoption, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Adopting older children presents other parenting issues.&lt;ref&gt;Grade School: Understanding Child Development and the Impact of Adoption http://adoption.com/wiki/Grade_School:_Understanding_Child_Development_and_the_Impact_of_Adoption&lt;/ref&gt; Some children from foster care have histories of maltreatment, such as physical and psychological neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse, and are at risk of developing psychiatric problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gauthier, Stollak, Messe, &amp; Arnoff, (1996)&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gauthier | first1 = L. | last2 = Stollak | first2 = G. | last3 = Messe | first3 = L. | last4 = Arnoff | first4 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Recall of childhood neglect and physical abuse as differential predictors of current psychological functioning | url = | journal = Child Abuse and Neglect | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 549–559 | doi=10.1016/0145-2134(96)00043-9 | pmid=8832112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Malinosky-Rummell &amp; Hansen, (1993)&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Malinosky-Rummell | first1 = R. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = D.J. | year = 1993 | title = Long term consequences of childhood physical abuse | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 114 | issue = 1| pages = 68–69 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.114.1.68 | pmid=8346329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such children are at risk of developing a disorganized attachment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons-Ruth &amp; Jacobvitz, (1999)&quot;&gt;Lyons-Ruth K. &amp; Jacobvitz, D.

Concerning developmental milestones, studies from the Colorado Adoption Project examined [[Heritability|genetic influences]] on adoptee maturation, concluding that cognitive abilities of adoptees reflect those of their adoptive parents in early childhood but show little similarity by adolescence, resembling instead those of their biological parents and to the same extent as peers in non-adoptive families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nature 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plomin | first1 = R. | last2 = Fulker | first2 = D.W. | last3 = Corley | first3 = R. | last4 = DeFries | first4 = J.C. | year = 1997 | title = Nature, nurture, and cognitive development from 1–16 years: A parent-offspring adoption study | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 8 | issue = 6| pages = 442–447 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00458.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar mechanisms appear to be at work in the physical development of adoptees. Danish and American researchers conducting studies on the genetic contribution to [[body mass index]] found correlations between an adoptee's weight class and his biological parents' BMI while finding no relationship with the adoptive family environment. Moreover, about one-half of inter-individual differences were due to individual non-shared influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;&gt;AJ Stunkard, An adoption study of human obesity, [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/314/4/193 The New England Journal of Medicine] Volume 314:193–198, 23 January 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;International journal of obesity&quot;&gt;Vogler, G.P., Influences of genes and shared family environment on adult body mass index assessed in an adoption study by a comprehensive path model, [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=3406929 International journal of obesity], 1995, vol. 19, no1, pp. 40–45&lt;/ref&gt;

These differences in development appear to play out in the way young adoptees deal with major life events. In the case of parental divorce, adoptees have been found to respond differently from children who have not been adopted. While the general population experienced more behavioral problems, substance use, lower school achievement, and impaired social competence after parental divorce, the adoptee population appeared to be unaffected in terms of their outside relationships, specifically in their school or social abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Psychological Association&quot;&gt;Thomas O'Conner, Are Associations Between Parental Divorce and Children's Adjustment Genetically Mediated?, [http://www.apa.org/journals/features/dev364429.pdf American Psychological Association] 2000, Vol. 36 No.4 429–437&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on the original parents===
Several factors affect the decision to release or raise the child. White adolescents tend to give up their babies to non-relatives, whereas black adolescents are more likely to receive support from their own community in raising the child and also in the form of informal adoption by relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Furstenburg, F.F. &amp; Brooks-Gunn, J. (1985). Teenage childbearing: Causes, consequences, and remedies. In L. Aiken and D. Mechanic (Eds.), Applications of social science to clinical medicine and health policy (pp. 307–334). New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Leynes and by Festinger and Young, Berkman, and Rehr found that for pregnant adolescents, the decision to release the child for adoption depended on the attitude toward adoption held by the adolescent's mother.&lt;ref&gt;as cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Kallen | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Griffore | first2 = R.J. | last3 = Popovich | first3 = S. | last4 = Powell | first4 = V. | year = 1990 | title = Adolescent mothers and their mothers view adoption | url = | journal = Family Relations | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 311–316 | doi=10.2307/584877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that pregnant adolescents whose mothers had a higher level of education were more likely to release their babies for adoption. Research suggests that women who choose to release their babies for adoption are more likely to be younger, enrolled in school, and have lived in a two-parent household at age 10, than those who kept and raised their babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donnelly | first1 = B.W. | last2 = Voydanoff | first2 = P. | year = 1996 | title = Parenting versus placing for adoption: Consequences for adolescent mothers | url = | journal = Family Relations | volume = 45 | issue = 4| pages = 427–434 | doi=10.2307/585172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is limited research on the consequences of adoption for the original parents, and the findings have been mixed. One study found that those who released their babies for adoption were less comfortable with their decision than those who kept their babies. However, levels of comfort over both groups were high, and those who released their child were similar to those who kept their child in ratings of life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and positive future outlook for schooling, employment, finances, and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = D. | last2 = Namerow | first2 = P.B. | last3 = Bauer | first3 = U. | year = 1992 | title = Short-term consequences of parenting versus adoption among young unmarried women | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 54 | issue = 1| pages = 80–90 | doi=10.2307/353277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent research found that adolescent mothers who chose to release their babies for adoption were more likely to experience feelings of sorrow and regret over their decision than those who kept their babies. However, these feelings decreased significantly from one year after birth to the end of the second year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donnelly, B.W. &amp; Voydanoff, P&quot;&gt;Donnelly, B.W. &amp; Voydanoff, P.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research found that in a sample of mothers who had released their children for adoption four to 12 years prior, every participant had frequent thoughts of their lost child. For most, thoughts were both negative and positive in that they produced both feelings of sadness and joy. Those who experienced the greatest portion of positive thoughts were those who had open, rather than closed or time-limited mediated adoptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fravel | first1 = D.L. | last2 = McRoy | first2 = R.G. | last3 = Grotevant | first3 = H.D. | year = 2000 | title = Birthmother perceptions of the psychologically present adopted child: Adoption openness and boundary ambiguity | url = | journal = Family Relations | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 425–433 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2000.00425.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study that compared mothers who released their children to those who raised them, mothers who released their children were more likely to delay their next pregnancy, to delay marriage, and to complete job training. However, both groups reached lower levels of education than their peers who were never pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaughlin | first1 = S.D. | last2 = Manninen | first2 = D.L. | last3 = Winges | first3 = L.D. | year = 1988 | title = Do adolescents who relinquish their children fare better or worse than those who raise them? | url = | journal = Family Planning Perspectives | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 25–32 | doi=10.2307/2135594}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found similar consequences for choosing to release a child for adoption. Adolescent mothers who released their children were more likely to reach a higher level of education and to be employed than those who kept their children. They also waited longer before having their next child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donnelly, B.W. &amp; Voydanoff, P&quot;/&gt; Most of the research that exists on adoption effects on the natural parents was conducted with samples of adolescents, or with women who were adolescents when carrying their babies—little data exists for natural parents from other populations. Furthermore, there is a lack of longitudinal data that may elucidate long-term social and psychological consequences for natural parents who choose to release their children for adoption

==Development of adoptees==
Previous research on adoption has led to assumptions that indicate that there is a heightened risk in terms of psychological development and social relationships for adoptees. Yet, such assumptions have been clarified as flawed due to methodological failures. But more recent studies have been supportive in indicating more accurate information and results about the similarities, differences and overall lifestyles of adoptees.&lt;ref&gt;L. Borders, et. Adult Adoptees and Their Friends, National Council of Family Relations, 2000, Vol. 49, No. 4,&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence about the development of adoptees can be supported in newer studies. It can be said that adoptees, in some respect, tend to develop differently from the general population. This can be seen in many aspects of life, but usually can be found as a greater risk around the time of adolescence. For example, it has been found that many adoptees experience difficulty in establishing a sense of identity.&lt;ref name=Beauchesne&gt;Beauchesne, Lise M. (1997). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/213/ As if born to: The social construction of a deficit identity position for adopted persons]'' (D.S.W. dissertation) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===
There are many ways in which the concept of identity can be defined. It is true in all cases that identity construction is an ongoing process of development, change and maintenance of identifying with the self. Research has shown that adolescence is a time of identity progression rather than regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meeus|first1=Wim|title=The Study of Adolescent Formation 2000-2010: A Review of Longitunal Research|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|volume=21|issue=1|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; One's identity tends to lack stability in the beginning years of life but gains a more stable sense in later periods of childhood and adolescence. Typically associated with a time of experimentation, there are endless factors that go in to the construction of one's identity. As well as being many factors, there are many types of identities one can associate with. Some categories of identity include gender, sexuality, class, racial and religious, etc. For transracial and [[International adoption|international]] adoptees, tension is generally found in the categories of racial, ethnic and national identification. Because of this,the strength and functionality of family relationships play a huge role in its development and outcome of identity construction. Transracial and transnational adoptees tend to develop feelings of a lack of acceptance because of such racial, ethnic, and cultural differences. Therefore, exposing transracial and transnational adoptees to their &quot;cultures of origin&quot; is important in order to better develop a sense of identity and appreciation for cultural diversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orphan Sunday&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patton-Imani|first1=Sandra|title=Orphan Sunday: Narratives of Salvation in Transnational Adoption|journal=Dialog: A Journey of Theology|date=2012|volume=51|issue=4|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity construction and reconstruction for transnational adoptees the instant they are adopted. For example, based upon specific laws and regulations of the United States, the Child Citizen Act of 2000 makes sure to grant immediate U.S. citizenship to adoptees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orphan Sunday&quot; /&gt; Although this act is specific to particular laws created by the United States, it can be understood that such a notion reconstructs a sense of identity for adoptees as a United States citizen. Transnational adoptees also have to evaluate their racial, ethnic and cultural differences that are incognizant with their adoption family. Therefore, these factors may explain how tension is created with transracial and transnational adoptees.

Identity is defined both by what one is and what one is not. Adoptees born into one family lose an identity and then borrow one from the adopting family.
The formation of identity is a complicated process and there are many factors that affect its outcome. From an perspective of looking at issues in adoption circumstances, the people involved and affected by adoption (the biological parent, the adoptive parent and the adoptee) can be known as the &quot;triad members and state&quot;.
Adoption may threaten triad members' sense of identity. Triad members often express feelings related to confused identity and identity crises because of differences between the triad relationships.
Adoption, for some, precludes a complete or integrated sense of self. Triad members may experience themselves as incomplete, deficient, or unfinished. They state that they lack feelings of well-being, integration, or solidity associated with a fully developed identity.&lt;ref&gt;24. Kaplan, Deborah N Silverstein and Sharon. Lifelong Issues in Adoption.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===

Family plays a vital role in identity formation. This is not only true in childhood but also in adolescence. Identity (gender/sexual/ethnic/religious/family) is still forming during adolescence and family holds a vital key to this.
The research seems to be unanimous; a stable, secure, loving, honest and supportive family in which all members feel safe to explore their identity is necessary for the formation of a sound identity. Transracial and [[International adoption|International]] adoptions are some factors that play a significant role in the identity construction of adoptees. Many tensions arise from relationships built between the adoptee(s) and their family. These include being &quot;different&quot; from the parent(s), developing a positive racial identity, and dealing with racial/ethnic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Fern L.|last2=Mickelson|first2=Stacie|last3=Lopez Davila|first3=Mariana|title=Transracial Foster Care and Adoption: Issues and Realities|journal=New England Journal of Public Policy|date=22 September 2013|volume=25|issue=1|page=2|ref=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that multicultural and transnational youth tend to identify with their parents origin of culture and ethnicity rather than their residing location, yet it is sometimes hard to balance an identity between the two because school environments tend to lack diversity and acknowledgment regarding such topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=Stephanie|last2=Loomis|first2=Colleen|last3=Akkari|first3=Abdeljalil|title=Intercultural immigrant youth identities in contexts of family, friends, and school|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|date=May 2012|volume=16|page=63|doi=10.1080/13676261.2012.693593|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13676261.2012.693593|accessdate=9 December 2014|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tensions also tend to create questions for the adoptee, as well as the family, to contemplate. Some common questions include what will happen if the family is more naïve to the ways of socially constructed life? Will tensions arise if this is the case? What if the very people that are supposed to be modeling a sound identity are in fact riddled with insecurities? Ginni Snodgrass answers these questions in the following way.
The secrecy in an adoptive family and the denial that the adoptive family is different builds dysfunction into it. &quot;...&amp;nbsp;social workers and insecure adoptive parents have structured a family relationship that is based on dishonesty, evasions and exploitation. To believe that good relationships will develop on such a foundation is psychologically unsound&quot; (Lawrence). Secrecy erects barriers to forming a healthy identity.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, Ginni D. Research and Studies on Adoptees. Statistics on the effects of Adoption. Appendix A. s.l. : George Fox University, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research says that the dysfunction, untruths and evasiveness that can be present in adoptive families not only makes identity formation impossible, but also directly works against it. What effect on identity formation is present if the adoptee knows they are adopted but has no information about their biological parents? Silverstein and Kaplan's research states that adoptees lacking medical, genetic, religious, and historical information are plagued by questions such as &quot;Who am I?&quot; &quot;Why was I born?&quot; &quot;What is my purpose?&quot; This lack of identity may lead adoptees, particularly in adolescent years, to seek out ways to belong in a more extreme fashion than many of their non-adopted peers. Adolescent adoptees are overrepresented among those who join sub-cultures, run away, become pregnant, or totally reject their families.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Deborah N Silverstein and Sharon. Lifelong Issues in A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adoption, and it's&lt;!-- sic --&gt; Associated Therapy Issues. A Literature Review discussing the impact of adoption on Self-worth, Identity and the Primary Relationships of the Adoptee and both the Biological and Adoptive Parents. Christine Peers 11/7/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning developmental milestones, studies from the Colorado Adoption Project examined [[Heritability|genetic influences]] on adoptee maturation, concluding that cognitive abilities of adoptees reflect those of their adoptive parents in early childhood but show little similarity by adolescence, resembling instead those of their biological parents and to the same extent as peers in non-adoptive families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nature 1997&quot;/&gt;

Similar mechanisms appear to be at work in the physical development of adoptees. Danish and American researchers conducting studies on the genetic contribution to [[body mass index]] found correlations between an adoptee's weight class and his biological parents' BMI while finding no relationship with the adoptive family environment. Moreover, about one-half of inter-individual differences were due to individual non-shared influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;International journal of obesity&quot;/&gt;

These differences in development appear to play out in the way young adoptees deal with major life events. In the case of parental divorce, adoptees have been found to respond differently from children who have not been adopted. While the general population experienced more behavioral problems, substance use, lower school achievement, and impaired social competence after parental divorce, the adoptee population appeared to be unaffected in terms of their outside relationships, specifically in their school or social abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;American Psychological Association&quot;/&gt;

The adoptee population does, however, seem to be more at risk for certain behavioral issues. Researchers from the University of Minnesota studied adolescents who had been adopted and found that adoptees were twice as likely as non-adopted people to suffer from [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] (with an 8% rate in the general population).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Arline, [http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1367897 Psychiatric Times], 26 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide risks were also significantly greater than the general population. Swedish researchers found both international and domestic adoptees undertook suicide at much higher rates than non-adopted peers; with international adoptees and female international adoptees, in particular, at highest risk.&lt;ref&gt;Annika von Borczyskowski, Suicidal behavior in national and international adult adoptees, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/y73646n507593n76/ Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology] Volume 41, Number 2 / February, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, work on adult adoptees has found that the additional risks faced by adoptees are largely confined to adolescence. Young adult adoptees were shown to be alike with adults from biological families and scored better than adults raised in alternative family types including single parent and step-families.&lt;ref&gt;William Feigelman, Comparisons with Persons Raised in Conventional Families, ''Marriage &amp; Family Review'' 1540-9635, Volume 25, Issue 3, 1997, Pages 199&amp;nbsp;– 223&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, while adult adoptees showed more variability than their non-adopted peers on a range of psychosocial measures, adult adoptees exhibited more similarities than differences with adults who had not been adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Border | first1 = L. DiAnne | year = 2000 | title = Adult Adoptees and Their Friends | journal = [[Family Relations (journal)|Family Relations]] | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 407–418 | jstor=585836 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2000.00407.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many cases of remediation or the reversibility of early trauma. For example, in one of the earliest studies conducted, Professor Goldfarb in England concluded that some children adjust well socially and emotionally despite their negative experiences of institutional deprivation in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb, W. (1955). Emotional and intellectual consequences of psychologic deprivation in infancy: A Re-evaluation. In P. Hoch &amp; J. Zubin (Eds.), Psychopathology of Childhood (pp. 105–119). NY: Grune &amp; Stratton.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers also found that prolonged institutionalization does not necessarily lead to emotional problems or character defects in all children. This suggests that there will always be some children who fare well, who are resilient, regardless of their experiences in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Pringel, M. L., &amp; Bossio, V. (1960). Early, prolonged separation and emotional adjustment. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 37–48&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, much of the research on psychological outcomes for adoptees draws from clinical populations. This suggests that conclusions such that adoptees are more likely to have behavioral problems such as ODD and ADHD may be biased. Since the proportion of adoptees that seek mental health treatment is small, psychological outcomes for adoptees compared to those for the general population are more similar than some researchers propose.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, L. (2012). Adoption. In Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Retrieved from http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on adoptees===
Adoption gives many children great opportunities that they may have never otherwise received. Such opportunities include loving homes and environments, parents who are able to provide and care for all their financial needs as well as access to education. While these are all positive factors that will enhance the life of the adopted child, many do not realize that there are negative effects adopted children can experience both mentally and emotionally.
According to studies from Princeton University, adoptees (especially those coming from closed adoptions) may suffer from a wide range of mental effects at all stages of life. One of the largest issues that an adoptee may deal with is the formation of their identity. It is believed that children who are adopted may not feel as though they fit in with their adoptive families knowing that their adoptive parents are not the people who gave birth to them. Especially in adolescence, many adopted children begin to question where certain personality traits, likes or dislike, and physical characteristics come from. What characteristics come from the biological family and which come from the adoptive family? Adoptees struggle with whom they are or whom they could become because they do not know or understand where everything about them comes from. For many, this uncertainty can be unsettling and uncomfortable. They may begin to question everything about themselves. 
Adopted children also often find it hard to form comfortable and meaningful relationships. These relationships can be friendly, familial or romantic. Because many adoptees feel that their biological parents left them, they may be afraid to form new relationships in fear that those involved may &quot;leave&quot; them as well. This can lead to holding back and withdrawing from relationships when they feel like they are becoming too attached as well as not forming relationships at all. The fear of being left or forgotten is what often holds adoptees back from creating such relationships. Many adoptees feel that they can never truly relate to or trust anybody because their family experiences can be so vastly different from those of people who have not been adopted. It is because of such fears that so many adoptees find it hard to create relationships in their lives.
Another common feeling that many people who are adopted deal with is a feeling of guilt. This guilt is felt towards both their birth families as well as their adoptive families. They may feel guilty towards their birth family because in many ways, they have accepted their adoptive family as their own and would not want their birth family to be upset or jealous. Many adoptees call their adoptive parents &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; and refer to adoptive siblings as such, which adoptees feel may hurt their biological families, should they find out. The sense of guilt towards adoptive parents comes from curiosity about biological families. Adoptees often feel that any curiosity about their origins and their birth families may hurt their adoptive one. They believe that the adoptive family will feel a sense of betrayal for wanting to know about where they came from, especially if the adoption allows for access to such information. Adoptees may also fear that their adoptive family may love them less because of their curiosity. 
When adopted children grow into young adults, many worry about their health. For many adopted children, their adoptive families are given little to none of their medical history, especially if the adoption was international. This can be due to lack of information on the part of the biological family, type of adoption or circumstance in which the adoptee was found (for example being left at an orphanage in a foreign country). Simple trips to the doctor or dentist, for something as small as a check up, can bring about great worry because there is so many unknowns to ones health when the person is adopted. Anxiety over lack of medical history may become worse for those who are seeking to get married and start a family. If one of the parents is unaware of medical history, having a child becomes much more difficult. The risks of being unable to conceive, or the child being born with certain health issues are higher because parental medical history is unknown.

===Public perception of adoption===
[[File:Anne of Green Gables.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Actors at the [[Anne of Green Gables]] Museum on [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada. Since its first publication in 1908, the story of the orphaned Anne, and how the Cuthberts took her in, has been widely popular in the English-speaking world and, later, Japan.]]
In Western culture, many see that the common image of a family being that of a heterosexual couple with biological children. This idea places alternative family forms outside the norm. As a consequence, research indicates, disparaging views of adoptive families exist, along with doubts concerning the strength of their family bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Adoption, Family Ideology, and Social Stigma: Bias in Community Attitudes, Adoption Research, and Practice|first=Katarina|last=Wegar|journal=Family Relations|volume=49|issue=4|pages=363–370|publisher=National Council on Family Relations | doi = 10.2307/585831| jstor = 585831| doi_brokendate = 2015-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/353920| jstor = 353920| title = Perception of Adoption as Social Stigma: Motivation for Search and Reunion| journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family| volume = 57| issue = 3| pages = 653| year = 1995| last1 = March | first1 = K. }} pg. 654.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent adoption attitudes survey completed by the Evan Donaldson Institute provides further evidence of this stigma. Nearly one-third of the surveyed population believed adoptees are less-well adjusted, more prone to medical issues, and predisposed to drug and alcohol problems. Additionally, 40–45% thought adoptees were more likely to have behavior problems and trouble at school. In contrast, the same study indicated adoptive parents were viewed favorably, with nearly 90% describing them as &quot;lucky, advantaged, and unselfish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;National Adoption Attitudes Survey, June 2002, Evan Donaldson Institute, page 20 and 38.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of people state that their primary source of information about adoption comes from friends and family and the news media. Nevertheless, most people report the media provides them a favorable view of adoption; 72% indicated receiving positive impressions.&lt;ref&gt;National Adoption Attitudes Survey, June 2002, Evan Donaldson Institute, page 47&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, still substantial criticism of the media's adoption coverage.

==Reform and reunion trends==
[[File:OpenRecords2.png|thumb|right|upright|Open Records emblem used in Adoptee Rights Protest, New Orleans, 2008, artist: D. Martin]]

Adoption practices have changed significantly over the course of the 20th century, with each new movement labeled, in some way, as reform.&lt;ref&gt;Adoption History Project (University of Oregon),[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/adoptionhistbrief.htm Topic History in Brief]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, efforts to improve adoption became associated with opening records and encouraging family preservation. These ideas arose from suggestions that the secrecy inherent in modern adoption may influence the process of forming an [[identity (social science)|identity]],&lt;ref name=&quot;primal-page.com&quot;&gt;[http://primal-page.com/verrier.htm Book Review: The Primal Wound by Nancy N. Verrier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 2003: Does Adoption Affect the Adolescent Eriksonian Task of Identity Formation? Available: http://www.cs.brown.edu/~jadrian/docs/papers/old/20030212%20Miles%20-%20Adoptive%20Identity.pdf Retrieved: 30 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; create confusion regarding [[genealogy]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bastards.org/activism/support.htm Why Adoptive Parents Support Open Records for Adult Adoptees&lt;/ref&gt; and provide little in the way of medical history.

'''Family preservation:''' As concerns over illegitimacy began to decline in the early 1970s, social-welfare agencies began to emphasize that, if possible, mothers and children should be kept together.&lt;ref&gt;Adoption History Project (University of Oregon), [http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/illegitimacy.htm Topic Illegtimacy]&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., this was clearly illustrated by the shift in policy of the New York Foundling Home, an adoption-institution that is among the country's oldest and one that had pioneered sealed records. It established three new principles including &quot;to prevent placements of children...,&quot; reflecting the belief that children would be better served by staying with their biological families, a striking shift in policy that remains in force today.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gottlieb, The Foundling, 2001, pg. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open records:''' Movements to unseal adoption records for adopted citizens proliferated along with increased acceptance of [[illegitimacy]]. In the United States, Jean Paton founded Orphan Voyage in 1954, and Florence Fisher founded the Adoptees' Liberty Movement Association (ALMA) in 1971, calling sealed records &quot;an affront to human dignity.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Adoption History Project [http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/confidentiality.htm Topic Confidentiality]&lt;/ref&gt; While in 1975, Emma May Vilardi created the first mutual-consent registry, the [[International Soundex Reunion Registry]] (ISRR), allowing those separated by adoption to locate one another.&lt;ref&gt;ISRR&amp;nbsp;– International Soundex Reunion Registry [http://www.isrr.net/history.html Reunion Registry]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lee Campbell and other birthmothers established CUB (Concerned United Birthparents). Similar ideas were taking hold globally with grass-roots organizations like Parent Finders in Canada and Jigsaw in Australia. In 1975, England and Wales opened records on moral grounds.&lt;ref&gt;R. Rushbrooke, The proportion of adoptees who have received their birth records in England and Wales, Population Trends (104), Summer 2001, pp 26–34.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1979, representatives of 32 organizations from 33 states, Canada and Mexico gathered in Washington, DC to establish the [[American Adoption Congress]] (AAC) passing a unanimous resolution: &quot;Open Records complete with all identifying information for all members of the adoption triad, birthparents, adoptive parents and adoptee at the adoptee's [[age of majority]] (18 or 19, depending on state) or earlier if all members of the triad agree.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;TRIADOPTION Archives [http://www.triadoption.com/Misc/AAC%201979%20Resolution.pdf TRIADOPTION Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; Later years saw the evolution of more militant organizations such as [[Bastard Nation]] (founded in 1996), groups that helped overturn sealed records in Alabama, Delaware, New Hampshire, Oregon, Tennessee, and Maine.&lt;ref&gt;USA Today, [http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080213/1a_adoptionxx.art.htm As adoptees seek roots, states unsealing records], 13 February 2008.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bastard Nation, [http://www.bastards.org/activism/local/nh/ Bastard Nation – New Hampshire]&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, groups such as Origins USA (founded in 1997) started to actively speak about family preservation and the rights of mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Origins USA position papers Available: http://originsusa.memberlodge.org/Default.aspx?pageId=24588 Accessed: 27 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The intellectual tone of these recent reform movements was influenced by the publishing of ''The Primal Wound'' by [[Nancy Verrier]]. &quot;Primal wound&quot; is described as the &quot;devastation which the infant feels because of separation from its birth mother. It is the deep and consequential feeling of abandonment which the baby adoptee feels after the adoption and which may continue for the rest of his life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;primal-page.com&quot;/&gt;

===Reunion===
[[File:AdopteeReunion.jpg|thumb|left|Writer Lesley Lathrop (left), an adoptee, at a reunion]]

Estimates for the extent of search behavior by adoptees have proven elusive; studies show significant variation.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter and Bertocci, &quot;The Meaning of the Search&quot; in Brodzinsky and Schechter, Psychology of Adoption,&quot; 1990, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In part, the problem stems from the small adoptee population which makes random surveying difficult, if not impossible.

Nevertheless, some indication of the level of search interest by adoptees can be gleaned from the case of England and Wales which opened adoptees' birth records in 1975. The UK Office for National Statistics has projected that 33% of all adoptees would eventually request a copy of their original birth records, exceeding original forecasts made in 1975 when it was believed that only a small fraction of the adoptee population would request their records. The projection is known to underestimate the true search rate, however, since many adoptees of the era get their birth records by other means.&lt;ref&gt;R. Rushbrooke, The proportion of adoptees who have received their birth records in England and Wales, Population Trends (104), UK Office for National Statistics, Summer 2001, pages 26–34&lt;/ref&gt;

The research literature states adoptees give four reasons for desiring reunion: 1) they wish for a more complete genealogy, 2) they are curious about events leading to their conception, birth, and relinquishment, 3) they hope to pass on information to their children, and 4) they have a need for a detailed biological background, including medical information. It is speculated by adoption researchers, however, that the reasons given are incomplete: although such information could be communicated by a third-party, interviews with adoptees, who sought reunion, found they expressed a need to actually meet biological relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;cite jstor|353920&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/353920| jstor = 353920| title = Perception of Adoption as Social Stigma: Motivation for Search and Reunion| journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family| volume = 57| issue = 3| pages = 653| year = 1995| last1 = March | first1 = K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears the desire for reunion is linked to the adoptee's interaction with and acceptance within the community. Internally focused theories suggest some adoptees possess ambiguities in their sense of self, impairing their ability to present a consistent identity. Reunion helps resolve the lack of self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/dissertations/AAINN60675/ K. March, &quot;The stranger who bore me: Adoptee-birth mother interactions,&quot; Dissertation, McMaster University, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Externally focused theories, in contrast, suggest that reunion is a way for adoptees to overcome social stigma. First proposed by Goffman, the theory has four parts: 1) adoptees perceive the absence of biological ties as distinguishing their adoptive family from others, 2) this understanding is strengthened by experiences where non-adoptees suggest adoptive ties are weaker than blood ties, 3) together, these factors engender, in some adoptees, a sense of social exclusion, and 4) these adoptees react by searching for a blood tie that reinforces their membership in the community. The externally focused rationale for reunion suggests adoptees may be well adjusted and happy within their adoptive families, but will search as an attempt to resolve experiences of social stigma.&lt;ref name=&quot;cite jstor|353920&quot;/&gt;

Some adoptees reject the idea of reunion. It is unclear, though, what differentiates adoptees who search from those who do not. One paper summarizes the research, stating, &quot;...attempts to draw distinctions between the searcher and non-searcher are no more conclusive or generalizable than attempts to substantiate...differences between adoptees and nonadoptees.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schechter and Bertocci, &quot;The Meaning of the Search&quot; in Brodzinsky and Schechter, Psychology of Adoption,&quot; 1990, pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, reunions can bring a variety of issues for adoptees and parents. Nevertheless, most reunion results appear to be positive. In the largest study to date (based on the responses of 1,007 adoptees and relinquishing parents), 90% responded that reunion was a beneficial experience. This does not, however, imply ongoing relationships were formed between adoptee and parent nor that this was the goal.&lt;ref&gt;R. Sullivan and E. Lathrop, &quot;Openness in adoption: retrospective lessons and prospective choices,&quot; Children and Youth Services Review Vol. 26 Issue 4, April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book &quot;Adoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child&quot; by Judith and Martin Land provides insight into the mind of an adoptee from childhood through to adulthood and the emotions invoked when reunification with their birth mothers is desired.

===Controversial adoption practices===
{{See also|Adoption fraud}}
Reform and family preservation efforts have also been strongly associated with the perceived misuse of adoption. In some cases, parents' rights have been terminated when their ethnic or socio-economic group has been deemed unfit by society. Some of these practices were generally accepted but have later been considered abusive; others were uncontroversially reprehensible.

Forced adoption based on ethnicity occurred during World War II. In German occupied Poland, it is estimated that 200,000 Polish children with purportedly Aryan traits were [[Kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany|removed from their families]] and given to German or Austrian couples,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/edf71f50-c208-11de-be3a-00144feab49a.html Searching for missing relatives in Poland]&quot;. [[Financial Times]]. 30 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and only 25,000 returned to their families after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gitta Sereny]], [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/children.html &quot;Stolen Children&quot;], rpt. in ''[[Jewish Virtual Library]]'' ([[American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise]]). Accessed 15 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stolen Generation]] of [[Aboriginal Peoples|Aboriginal people]] in Australia were affected by similar policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/sorry-day-stolen-generations|title=Sorry Day and the Stolen Generations|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were [[Native Americans in the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/IAP.html|title=The Adoption History Project|publisher=Department of History, University of Oregon|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[First Nations]] of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1307460755710|title=First Nations in Canada

These practices have become significant social and political issues in recent years, and in many cases the policies have changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EiPWZm49bLYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=%22adoption+fraud+is%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QzmCaEeXWA&amp;sig=oPRgvXDBhsY5rHDPlMPfXAyj0-k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_7YCTfLtOsbinQeGjJTlDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22adoption%20fraud%20is%22&amp;f=false |title=Yes, You Can Adopt!: A Comprehensive Guide to Adoption|publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adoptimist.com/adoption-blog/internet-adoption-scams-russian-adoption-ban|title=Internet Adoption Scams and the Russian Adoption Ban|last=Bernardo|first=Sanford M.|date=31 December 2012|publisher=Adoptimist|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, for example, now has the 1978 [[Indian Child Welfare Act]], which allows the tribe and family of a Native American child to be involved in adoption decisions, with preference being given to adoption within the child's tribe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicwa.org/Indian_Child_Welfare_Act/ National Indian Child Welfare Association: the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s through the 1970s, a period called the [[Baby Scoop Era|baby scoop era]], adoption practices that involved coercion were directed against unwed mothers, as described for the US in ''[[The Girls Who Went Away]].''

More recently the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship in Argentina from 1976 to 1983]] is known to have given hundreds of babies born to women captives who were then murdered to be brought up by military families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abuelas.org.ar/english/history.htm Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo]'s website {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption terminology===
{{Main article|Language of adoption}}

The '''language of adoption''' is changing and evolving, and since the 1970s has been a controversial issue tied closely to adoption reform efforts. The controversy arises over the use of terms which, while designed to be more appealing or less offensive to some persons affected by adoption, may simultaneously cause offense or insult to others. This controversy illustrates the problems in adoption, as well as the fact that coining new words and phrases to describe ancient social practices will not necessarily alter the feelings and experiences of those affected by them. Two of the contrasting sets of terms are commonly referred to as '''positive adoption language''' (PAL) (sometimes called ''respectful adoption language (RAL)''), and '''honest adoption language''' (HAL).

====Positive adoptive language (PAL)====
In the 1970s, as adoption search and support organizations developed, there were challenges to the language in common use at the time. As books like ''Adoption Triangle'' by Sorosky, Pannor and Baran were published, and support groups formed like CUB (Concerned United Birthparents), a major shift from &quot;natural parent&quot; to &quot;birthparent&quot;&lt;ref name=Birthparent&gt;[http://www.sacredhealing.com/triadoption/Misc./Origin%20of%20the%20Term%20Birthparent.pdf Birthparent Legacy Term] TRIADOPTION® Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/birthparents.htm Birth Parents] The Adoption History Project&lt;/ref&gt; occurred. Along with the change in times and social attitudes came additional examination of the language used in adoption.

Social workers and other professionals in the field of adoption began changing terms of use to reflect what was being expressed by the parties involved. In 1979, Marietta Spencer wrote &quot;The Terminology of Adoption&quot; for The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/archive/CwlaAT.htm Adoption Terminology] Child Welfare League of American 1980s&lt;/ref&gt; which was the basis for her later work &quot;Constructive Adoption Terminology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.adoption.com/articles/a-few-words-on-words-in-adoption.html Adoption Language] by Brenda Romanchik&lt;/ref&gt; This influenced Pat Johnston's &quot;Positive Adoption Language&quot; (PAL) and &quot;Respectful Adoption Language&quot; (RAL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perspectivespress.com/pjpal.html Speaking Positively: Using Respectful Adoption Language], by Patricia Irwin Johnston&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms contained in &quot;Positive Adoption Language&quot; include the terms &quot;birth mother&quot; (to replace the terms &quot;natural mother&quot; and &quot;real mother&quot;), and &quot;placing&quot; (to replace the term &quot;surrender&quot;). These kinds of recommendations encouraged people to be more aware of their use of adoption terminology.

====Honest adoption language (HAL)====
&quot;Honest Adoption Language&quot; refers to a set of terms that proponents say reflect the point of view that: (1) family relationships (social, emotional, psychological or physical) that existed prior to the legal adoption often continue past this point or endure in some form despite long periods of separation, and that (2) mothers who have &quot;voluntarily surrendered&quot; children to adoption (as opposed to involuntary terminations through court-authorized child-welfare proceedings) seldom view it as a choice that was freely made, but instead describe scenarios of powerlessness, lack of resources, and overall lack of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Logan, J. | year = 1996 | title = Birth Mothers and Their Mental Health: Uncharted Territory | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Work | volume = 26 | pages = 609–625 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.bjsw.a011137 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Wells, S. | year = 1993 | title = What do Birthmothers Want? | url = | journal = [[Adoption &amp; Fostering (journal)|Adoption and Fostering]] | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 22–26 | doi=10.1177/030857599301700405}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also reflects the point of view that the term &quot;birth mother&quot; is derogatory in implying that the woman has ceased being a mother after the physical act of giving birth. Proponents of HAL liken this to the mother being treated as a &quot;breeder&quot; or &quot;incubator&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundandlostsupport.com/birthmothermeansbreeder.html &quot;Why Birthmother Means Breeder,&quot;] by Diane Turski&lt;/ref&gt; Terms included in HAL include terms that were used before PAL, including &quot;natural mother,&quot; &quot;first mother,&quot; and &quot;surrendered for adoption.&quot;

====Inclusive adoption language====
There are supporters of various lists, developed over many decades, and there are persons who find them lacking, created to support an agenda, or furthering division. All terminology can be used to demean or diminish, uplift or embrace. In addressing the linguistic problem of naming, Edna Andrews says that using &quot;inclusive&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot; language is based upon the concept that &quot;language represents thought, and may even control thought.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cs&quot;&gt;Cultural Sensitivity and Political Correctness: The Linguistic Problem of Naming, Edna Andrews, ''American Speech'', Vol. 71, No. 4 (Winter, 1996), pp.389–404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of [[inclusive language]] defend it as inoffensive-language usage whose goal is multi-fold:

# The rights, opportunities, and freedoms of certain people are restricted because they are reduced to [[stereotype]]s.
# Stereotyping is mostly implicit, unconscious, and facilitated by the availability of pejorative labels and terms.
# Rendering the labels and terms socially unacceptable, people then must consciously think about ''how'' they describe someone unlike themselves.
# When labeling is a conscious activity, the described person's ''individual'' merits become apparent, rather than his or her stereotype.

A common problem is that terms chosen by an identity group, as acceptable descriptors of themselves, can be used in negative ways by detractors. This compromises the integrity of the language and turns what was intended to be positive into negative or vice versa, thus often devaluing acceptability, meaning and use.

Language at its best honors the self-referencing choices of the persons involved, uses inclusive terms and phrases, and is sensitive to the feelings of the primary parties. Language evolves with social attitudes and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adoptivefamilies.com/pdf/PositiveLanguage.pdf PAL 1992] OURS 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holtinternational.org/adoption/language.shtml Holt 1997] Holt International 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural variations==
{{Main article|Cultural variations in adoption}}

Attitudes and laws regarding adoption vary greatly. Whereas all cultures make arrangements whereby children whose birth parents are unavailable to rear them can be brought up by others, not all cultures have the concept of adoption, that is treating unrelated children as equivalent to biological children of the adoptive parents. Under Islamic Law, for example, adopted children must keep their original surname to be identified with blood relations,&lt;ref&gt;Sayyid Muhammad Rivzi, &quot;Adoption in Islam,&quot; [http://www.jaffari.org/files/literature/Adoption%20in%20Islam.pdf], 9 April 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; and, traditionally, observe [[hijab]] (the covering of women in the presence of non-family) in their adoptive households. In Egypt, these cultural distinctions have led to making adoption illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Lister and Mary Rogers, &quot;Egypt says adoptive moms were human smugglers,&quot; [http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/03/23/egypt.adoption.trial/index.html?eref=rss_world#cnnSTCText CNN], 23 March 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption as a human right==
As a reaction against the bans and hurdles affecting international adoption, scholars Elizabeth Bartholet and Paulo Barrozo claim that every child has a right to a family as a matter of basic human rights.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This claim devalues heritage or &quot;cultural&quot; claims and emphasizes the child's existence as a human being rather than a &quot;property&quot; of specific nations or, for example, abusive caregivers.

==Homecoming Day==
In some countries, such as the United States, &quot;Homecoming Day&quot; is the day when an adoptee is officially united with their new adoptive family.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In some adoptive families, this day marks an especially important event and is celebrated annually from thereafter. The term [[Gotcha Day]] is also used to refer to this day.
