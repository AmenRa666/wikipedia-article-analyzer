'''Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University''', popularly known as '''Virginia Tech''', is a public, [[land-grant university|land-grant]], research [[university]] with a main campus in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]], educational facilities in six regions statewide, and a study-abroad site in Switzerland. The commonwealth's third-largest university, Virginia Tech offers 225 undergraduate and graduate degree programs to some 30,600 students and manages a research portfolio of $513 million, the largest of any university in Virginia.&lt;ref name=NSF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site?method=rankingBySource&amp;ds=herd |title=NCSES:Academic Institution Profiles:Rankings by total R&amp;D expenditures |publisher=National Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university fulfills its land-grant mission of transforming knowledge to practice through technological leadership and by fueling economic growth and job creation locally, regionally, and across Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts&quot; /&gt;

The Virginia Tech Board of Visitors, which serves as the university's governing body, comprises 13{{nbsp}}members who are appointed by the governor of Virginia; the president of the state's Board of Agriculture and Consumer Services serves ex-officio as the 14th{{nbsp}}voting member. Serving as non-voting representatives are the presidents of the university's Faculty Senate and Staff Senate, who serve ex-officio, and an undergraduate student and a graduate student selected through a competitive review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Visitors, Virginia Tech |url=http://www.bov.vt.edu/ |publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's endowment, which is managed by the [[Virginia Tech Foundation]], topped $817 million as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vt.edu/about/factbook/financial-overview.html|title=Factbook: Financial Overview|publisher=[[Virginia Tech Foundation]]|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:VT Burruss Hall.jpg|thumb|200px|Virginia Tech's Burruss Hall]]

In 1872, with federal funds provided by the [[Morrill Act of 1862]], the [[Virginia General Assembly]] purchased the facilities of [[Preston and Olin Institute]], a small [[Methodist]] school in Southwest Virginia's rural [[Montgomery County, Virginia|Montgomery County]]. That same year, {{convert|250|acre}} of the [[Solitude (Blacksburg, Virginia)|Solitude Farm]] including the house and several farm buildings on the estate were acquired for $21,250&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vt.edu/about/buildings/Solitude.html|title=Solitude|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vaNRHPnom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Montgomery/150-0100-0003_Solitude_1989_Final_Nomination.pdf|format=PDF|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Solitude |last=Worsham|first=Gibson|date=January 1988|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commonwealth incorporated a new institution on the site, a state-supported [[land-grant]] [[military academy#Private academies|military institute]] named '''Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kinnear|first=Duncan Lyle|title=A Short History of Virginia Tech, 1850–1974: Pre-Founding 1850–1872|publisher= Virginia Tech |url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/125th/kinnear/prefound.htm|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College reorganizations===
Under the 1891–1907 presidency of [[John M. McBryde]], the school organized its academic programs into a traditional four-year college. The evolution of the school's programs led to a name change in 1896 to '''Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute'''. The &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical College&quot; portion of the name was popularly omitted almost immediately; in 1944, the name was officially changed to '''Virginia Polytechnic Institute''' ('''VPI''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A School of Many Names |url=https://www.unirel.vt.edu/history/historical_digest/index.html |publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, VPI changed a policy of compulsory participation in the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]] from four years to two years. In 1931, VPI began teaching classes at the Norfolk Division of the [[College of William and Mary]] (now [[Old Dominion University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/exhibits/odu75thanniversary/norfolkdivision.htm|title=Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary|publisher=[[Old Dominion University]]|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program eventually developed into a two-year engineering program that allowed students to transfer to VPI for their final two years of degree work.

In 1943, VPI merged with nearby Radford State Teachers College, which became VPI's women's division; the merger was dissolved in 1964. Today, [[Radford University]] enrolls more than 9,900 students and offers more than 150 undergraduate and graduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are, Radford University|url=http://radford.edu/content/radfordcore/home/about.html|publisher=[[Radford University]]|accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post World War II===
VPI President [[T. Marshall Hahn]], whose tenure ran from 1962 to 1974,&lt;ref name=&quot;TH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Life &amp; Times of Virginia Tech presidents: Thomas Marshall Hahn Jr., 1962–74 |publisher=Virginia Tech|url=http://www.president.vt.edu/presidents/Hahn.html|deadurl=no|accessdate=September 11, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111164906/http://www.president.vt.edu/lt_hahn.php|archivedate=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was responsible for many of the programs and policies that transformed VPI from a small, predominately male, military school into a major co-educational research university. The student body increased by roughly 1,000 students each year, new dormitories and academic buildings were constructed, faculty members were added – in 1966, for instance, more than 100 new professors joined the faculty – and research budgets were increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;TH&quot; /&gt; During Hahn's tenure, not only did the university graduate its first Rhodes Scholar, W.W. Lewis, Class of 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kinnear|first=Duncan Lyle|title=A Short History of Virginia Tech: The Hahn Administration 1962–1974|publisher = Virginia Tech|url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/125th/kinnear/hahn.htm|accessdate =September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the requirement for male students to participate in the Corps of Cadets for two years was dropped. Beginning in the fall 1973, women could participate in the corps, making Virginia Tech among the nation's first schools to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of the Corps of Cadets |url=https://www.vtcc.vt.edu/about/history.html|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, the state legislature allowed VPI university status and gave it the present legal name, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. In the early 1990s, university administration authorized the official use of &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; as equivalent to the full legal name; it has been used as the first-reference name for the school's athletic teams since the 1970s.  However, diplomas and transcripts still spell out the formal name. Similarly, the abbreviation &quot;VT&quot; is far more common today than either VPI or VPI&amp;SU.

===Twenty-first century===

The early decades of this century have seen expansion across the university's institutions in both physical and population sizes. Former President [[Charles W. Steger|Charles Steger]] brought Virginia Tech an allopathic medical school in 2007. The [[Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute]] was created with a strategic partnership with the [[Carilion Clinic]] and the Governor of Virginia. These years also brought about the rapid development of the university's professional schools of graduate education, and business programs. Virginia Tech brought in over a half-billion in research expenditures in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutVT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=About Virginia Tech|url=http://www.vt.edu/about/|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007 shooting====

{{main article|Virginia Tech shooting}}
On April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech student [[Seung-Hui Cho]] fatally shot 32 faculty members and students, wounding 17 others before killing himself on campus. The massacre is the deadliest [[mass shooting]] on a college campus, surpassing [[Charles Whitman]]'s rampage at the [[University of Texas]] in 1966. Although it was at the time the deadliest mass shooting committed by a lone gunman in U.S. history, it has since been surpassed by the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18140540/|title=Fact File: Deadliest shootings in the U.S.|accessdate=September 15, 2008 |work=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/12/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting/index.html|title=49 killed in Florida nightclub terror attack|first=Ralph Ellis, Ashley Fantz, Faith Karimi and Eliott C.

{{Main article|Virginia Tech campus}}
The [[Virginia Tech campus]] is located in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]]. The central campus is roughly bordered by Prices Fork Road to the northwest, Plantation Drive to the west, Main Street to the east, and US 460 Bypass to the south, though it has several thousand acres beyond the central campus.

[[File:Eggleston and Owens Halls Virginia Tech.JPG|thumb|right|Eggleston and Owens Halls.]]In the center of the Blacksburg campus lies the Drillfield, a large oval field running northeast to southwest, encircled by a one-way street known as Drillfield Drive. The Drillfield's name, coined in 1926 after the completion of Virginia Tech's first real stadium, stems from its use by the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]] to conduct military drills. A waterway, Stroubles Creek, runs beneath the Drillfield on the south side. A three-sided conduit for the creek that retains the natural bed of the creek was installed in 1934, and, in 1971, the first two asphalt walks were added. The urban legend that the Drillfield is sinking at the rate of an inch per year, however, has no basis in fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cox|first=Clara B.|url=http://www.vtmag.vt.edu/winter08/feature1.html|title=The Drillfield: At the heart of campus|publisher=Virginia Tech|magazine=VirginiaTech Magazine|date=Winter 2008|volume=30|number=2|accessdate=September 11, 2015| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140314204313/http://www.vtmag.vt.edu/winter08/feature1.html|archivedate=March 14, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Owens|first=Cody|url=http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/virginia_tech/article_9ec48152-572e-5c05-99b9-c7ee4e391b66.html|title=Sinking Drillfield rumors exposed|date=February 11, 2013|newspaper=[[Collegiate Times]]|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2014, three dirt paths were paved as part of the university's master plan to improve the landscaping and pathways, add seating areas, and enhance path entrances around the Drillfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Spieldenner|title=Dirt paths on Drillfield to be paved|url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2014/08/080514-vpa-drillfieldpaths.html|date=August 5, 2014|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the northwestern side of the Drillfield stands the majority of the university's academic and administrative buildings, including Burruss and McBryde halls. On the southeastern side of the Drillfield stands the majority of the residential buildings, including students' residence halls, dining halls, and War Memorial Gym. Newman Library is located on the eastern side of campus and connects to Torgersen Bridge, which spans the main road into campus, Alumni Mall. North of the Drillfield and northwest of Alumni Mall lies the Upper Quad, known to many students as military campus. The Upper Quad is home to the Corps of Cadets' barracks.

On the main campus in Blacksburg, the majority of the buildings incorporate [[Hokie Stone]] as a building material. In the 1990s, a Virginia Tech Board of Visitors committee expressed an intent that henceforth Hokie Stone should be used in all buildings constructed on the central campus. In 2010, the board of visitors passed a resolution making that sentiment official university policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vt.edu/about/traditions/hokie-stone.html|title=All About Hokie Stone|publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hokie Stone is generally gray, shaded by hues of brown and pink. The limestone is mined from various quarries in Southwest Virginia, Tennessee, and Alabama – one of which has been operated by the university since the 1950s. However, while it is true that the majority of buildings on campus incorporate Hokie Stone into their design, there are a few notable exceptions. For example, all buildings on the Upper Quad, including Lane Hall, are constructed of red brick. Also, a number of academic buildings were not constructed using Hokie Stone, as they were built before the institution of the rule mandating its use in all new university buildings.

===Agricultural Research and Extension Centers===
Virginia Tech has several agricultural research and extension centers located throughout the Commonwealth dedicated to improving agricultural practices and the quality of life of Virginia citizens. The Virginia Tech Agricultural Research and Extension Centers are: Alson H. Smith, Jr., Eastern Shore, Eastern Virginia, Hampton Roads, Middleburg, Reynolds Homestead, Shenandoah Valley, Southern Piedmont, Southwest Virginia, Tidewater, and Virginia Seafood.

===Power plant===
Distinguished by a towering 180-foot-high radial brick smokestack, the university's Central Steam Power Plant generates an annual steam output greater than 943 billion BTUs and provides campus buildings with a portion of their heat, hot water, and electricity needs. Nearly 90 percent of campus buildings are connected to the plant through an extensive network of underground tunnels—the main access point is on the Drillfield—and more than {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} of steam lines and piping provide heat to more than 6.8 million square feet of campus buildings. Only personnel with [[Confined space|confined-space]] training are permitted to enter the tunnel system, comprising {{convert|2.76|mi}} of inaccessible tunnel and {{convert|11.07|mi}} of piping; {{convert|3.78|mi}} of direct-bury piping in the ground; and {{convert|2.2|mi}} of accessible tunnel and {{convert|12.27|mi}} of piping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conde|first=Rommelyn|title=Energizer: The power plant that powers Tech|url=http://www.vtmag.vt.edu/sum12/energizer.html |magazine=VirginiaTech Magazine|volume=34|number=4|date=Summer 2004|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

===Residential life===
[[File:Virginia Tech Main Eggleston Hall.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Autumn is when the leaves turn orange and maroon, Virginia Tech's colors.]]
More than 9,000 Virginia Tech students reside on campus. A majority of the residential halls are located on the southwestern side of the Drillfield. Currently, there are twenty-nine residential halls housing undergraduate and graduate students.

The university has on-campus housing for graduate and professional students who are single; the housing may not accommodate families and spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://graduateschool.vt.edu/admitted/liveinbburg.html#housing|title=Virginia Tech Graduate School: Living in Blacksburg|publisher=Virginia Tech |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219182209/http://graduateschool.vt.edu/admitted/liveinbburg.html|archivedate=February 19, 2012|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All freshman are required to live on-campus. In order to live on-campus, students must fill out the Virginia Tech Housing and Dining Contract, which is a legally binding contract. The contract requires all students who live on-campus to purchase a major meal plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCDining&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dining.vt.edu/plans_policies/major_plans.html|title=Major Dining Plans {{!}} Dining Services {{!}} Virginia Tech|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Virginia Tech|access-date=|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be an example of [[Tying (commerce)|tying]].

Rasche Hall and its counterpart on the Upper Quad, Brodie Hall, were demolished in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Rasche has since been replaced by a new building, Pearson Hall, for the Corps of Cadets, while the replacement for Brodie is still under construction and is as of yet unnamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spieldenner|first1=Bob|last2=Foy|first2=Bill |url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2015/06/060815-vpa-brodiedemolition.html|title=Brodie Hall demolition begins this week|date=June 8, 2015 |publisher=Virginia Tech|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson Hall was completed November 2015. The late completion worsened a housing shortage caused by a large incoming freshman class.  Thomas Hall, another residence hall on the Upper Quad, is scheduled for demolition in 2016.

===Corps of Cadets===
[[File:Virginia Tech Corps marching.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]] marching]]
{{Main article|Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets}}

Until 1932, every able-bodied male was required to participate for four years in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets. The requirement was changed to two years until 1964, when participation became voluntary. Virginia Tech remains one of three public universities in the country ([[Texas A&amp;M]] and [[North Georgia College and State University]] are the others) with both an active corps of cadets and &quot;civilian&quot; lifestyle on its campus.

More than 1,000 cadets reside within the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Community, also known as the cadet barracks within the corps. The corps community is located in the historical Upper Quad, which features some of the oldest buildings on campus, with original structures dating back as far as the late 19th century.

===Dining===

Virginia Tech has five meal plans to choose from, as well as dining dollars or cash. Three of the meal plans are major meal plans. All major meal plans have a $1067 base cost, used to pay for the operation of the dining halls, with the rest of the cost being used as a debit account for food spending. However, to make up for the base cost, major meal plan holders get a 50% discount at all dining halls except D2, which has a 67% discount. These meal plans, ranging from smallest to largest, are the Major Flex Plan, the Mega Flex Plan, and the Premium Flex Plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCDining&quot; /&gt;

===Greek system===
Virginia Tech hosts a number of fraternities and sororities across four governing councils.

== Athletics ==
{{Main article|Virginia Tech Hokies}}
[[File:VT logo.svg|thumb|right|260px|Stylized &quot;VT&quot; logo]]

Virginia Tech teams are known as the Hokies. They compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports since the 2004–05 season. The Hokies previously competed in the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] from 2000–01 to 2003–04 (which its football program began competing as an associate member from 1991–92 to 1999–2000); the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] (A-10) from 1995–96 to 1999–2000; and the [[Metro Conference]] from 1978–79 to 1994–95. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

The [[HokieBird]] is a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]-like creature whose form has evolved from the original school mascot of the [[Fighting Gobbler]]. While the modern HokieBird still resembles a Fighting Gobbler, the word &quot;Hokie&quot; has all but replaced Fighting Gobbler in terms of colloquial use. The term originated from the ''[[Old Hokie]]'' spirit yell, in which there was no particular meaning indicated for the word.

The stylized '''VT''' (the abbreviation for '''Virginia Tech''') is used primarily by the athletic department as a symbol for Virginia Tech athletic teams. The &quot;athletic VT&quot; symbol is trademarked by the university and appears frequently on licensed merchandise.

During the early years of VPI, a rivalry developed between it and [[Virginia Military Institute]]. This rivalry developed into the original [[Military Classic of the South]] an annual football game between VMI and VPI usually held on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. That series ended after the 1984 season; VMI had elected to play at the [[Division I-AA]] level, now Division I FCS, after the NCAA's 1978 divisional split for football, and the schools' wide disparity in size had led to a similar imbalance in results. Another long-standing and important rivalry is between Virginia Tech and the [[University of Virginia]]. The [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry]] strengthened in concurrence with both UVA's and Tech's growth during the 1960s and 1970s and this is now the Hokies' primary program-wide athletic rivalry. The two schools compete in football for the Governor's &quot;Commonwealth Cup&quot; each season.

Virginia Tech's [[fight song]], ''[[Tech Triumph]]'', was written in 1919 and remains in use today. ''Tech Triumph'' is played at sporting events by both the Virginia Tech band, [[The Marching Virginians]], and the Corps of Cadets' band, the [[Highty Tighties]]. The ''[[Old Hokie]]'' spirit yell, written in 1896 and used to this day, is familiar to many Virginia Tech fans. This chant is also where the word Hoki (since modified to &quot;Hokie&quot;) originally appeared.

Williams spent the previous six seasons as the head coach at Marquette University, where he compiled a 139-69 record and led the Golden Eagles to five NCAA appearances, including a trip to the regional finals in the 2012-13 season, the same season that the team won the Big East Conference's regular season title. During Williams's tenure, Marquette tallied a 69-39 record in the Big East Conference, and six Marquette players made it to the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buzz Williams named new Hokie coach|url=http://www.hokiesports.com/mbasketball/recaps/20140321aaa.html|date=March 24, 2014 |website=HokieSports.com |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia Tech's men's basketball team had seen a resurgence of fan support since the arrival of coach [[Seth Greenberg]] in 2003–04 and the university's entry into the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] in 2004–05. Prior to Coach Greenberg's arrival in Blacksburg, the men's basketball team had not had a winning season since the 1995–96 season, when they received a bid to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]]. In addition, the team did not make the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East]] tournament in its first three seasons in the conference.

in 2003–04, Greenberg's squad made the Big East tournament. A year later, in their first season in the ACC, the Hokies scored their first postseason berth in nine years when they made the [[National Invitational Tournament|NIT]] in 2004–05. In the [[2006-07 Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball team|2006–07 season]], Greenberg's Hokies finished with a 10–6 record in the ACC and a 22–12 record overall, earning their first NCAA tournament berth in 11 years, reaching the NCAA second round before losing to [[Southern Illinois University|Southern Illinois]].

===Basketball (women's)===
Virginia Tech's women's basketball team, led by coach [[Dennis Wolff]], is in a rebuilding phase as it competes in the ACC. Under former coach [[Beth Dunkenberger]] it was a fixture in postseason play, having received a berth to the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] each season from 2003 to 2006. Virginia Tech's women have been in postseason play every year since the 1997–98 season, [[Bonnie Henrickson]]'s first season as the head coach of the Hokies, earning seven NCAA berths and three [[National Invitational Tournament|NIT]] appearances during that stretch.

Both basketball teams play their home games in [[Cassell Coliseum]].

Virginia Tech's football team plays home games in [[Lane Stadium]]. With a capacity of 66,233, Lane is relatively small in comparison to many other top FBS stadiums, yet it is still considered to be one of the loudest stadiums in the country. In 2005, it was recognized by [[rivals.com]] as having the best home-field advantage in college football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lavender|first=David|title=No place like home|date=August 21, 2005|website=[[Rivals.com]]|url=https://www.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=1014&amp;CID=444097|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Beamer]] was the Hokies' head coach from 1987 to 2015, and was the winningest active head coach in FBS football with 280 wins following the 2015 season. Beamer's teams were known for solid [[special teams]] play (called &quot;Beamer Ball&quot;) and for tough defenses headed by defensive coordinator [[Bud Foster]].

The Hokies currently hold the longest bowl streak in the country, having participated in bowl games in each of the last 23 seasons. Coach Beamer ended his tenure as head coach with a win in the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, LA, where the Bowl streak began in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeLassus|first=David|title=Current Consecutive Bowl Appearances|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/bowls/current_consecutive.php|accessdate=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1995 season, the Hokies have finished with a top-10 ranking five times, won seven conference championships (three [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East]] and four [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]]), and played once for the national championship, losing to [[1999 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] 46–29 in the [[2000 Sugar Bowl]]. Annually, Virginia Tech plays its traditional rival, the [[Virginia Cavaliers football|University of Virginia]], for the [[Commonwealth Cup (Virginia)|Commonwealth Cup]], a game which Virginia Tech has won 14 times in the 15 seasons since 1999.
