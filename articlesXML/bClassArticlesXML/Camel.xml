A '''camel''' is an [[even-toed ungulate]] within the genus '''''Camelus''''', bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as &quot;humps&quot; on its back. The three surviving species of camel are the [[dromedary]], or one-humped camel (''C. dromedarius''), which inhabits the [[Middle East]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]; the [[Bactrian camel|Bactrian]], or two-humped camel (''C. bactrianus''), which inhabits [[Central Asia]]; and the critically endagered [[wild Bactrian camel]] (''C. ferus'') that has limited populations in remote areas of [[northwest China]] and [[Mongolia]]. Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated; they provide [[camel milk|milk]], meat, [[camel hair|hair]] for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are [[working animal]]s with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.

The term ''camel'' is derived via [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (''&lt;span lang=&quot;la&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;camelus&lt;/span&gt;'' and &lt;span lang=&quot;el&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;κάμηλος ''kamēlos''&lt;/span&gt; respectively) from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''&lt;span lang=&quot;he&quot;&gt;gāmāl&lt;/span&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The New Oxford American Dictionary|edition=2nd|title=camel|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Herper | first = Douglas | title = camel | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | accessdate = 28 November 2012| url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Camel&quot; is also used more broadly to describe any of the seven camel-like mammals in the family [[Camelid]]ae: the three true camels and the four New World camelids: the [[llama]], [[alpaca]], [[guanaco]], and [[vicuña]] of South America.&lt;ref name=wordnik&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | publisher = wordnik | title = llama | encyclopedia = Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia | accessdate = 28 November 2012 | url = http://www.wordnik.com/words/llama }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bornstein10&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1751-0147-52-S1-S17 | issn = 1751-0147 | volume = 52 | issue = Suppl 1 | page = S17 | last = Bornstein | first = Set | title = Important ectoparasites of Alpaca (Vicugna pacos) | journal = Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica | accessdate = 28 November 2012 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.actavetscand.com/content/52/S1/S17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male dromedary camel has in its throat an organ called a [[dulla (organ)|dulla]], a large, inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] to assert dominance and attract females.

===Ecological and behavioral adaptations===
Camels do not directly store water in their humps as was once commonly believed. The humps are actually reservoirs of fatty tissue: concentrating [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] in their humps minimizes the insulating effect fat would have if distributed over the rest of their bodies, helping camels survive in hot climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice |first=Jocelyn |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/jan/05-20-things-you-didnt-know-about-fat |title=20 Things You Didn't Know About...

This [[lipolysis|fat metabolization]], while releasing energy, causes water to evaporate from the lungs during [[breathing|respiration]] (as oxygen is required for the metabolic process): overall, there is a net decrease in water.&lt;ref name=vannjones&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djur.cob.lu.se/Djurartiklar/Kamel.html|title=What secrets lie within the camel's hump?|first=Kerstin|last=Vann Jones|publisher=Lund University|location=Sweden|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rastogi71&gt;{{cite book | publisher = New Age International | isbn = 9788122412796 | last = Rastogi | first = S.

Camels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand long periods of time without any external source of water.&lt;ref name=roberts86 /&gt; Unlike other mammals, their [[red blood cell]]s are oval rather than circular in shape.

Camels are able to withstand changes in [[body temperature]] and water consumption that would kill most other animals. Their temperature ranges from {{convert|34|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} at dawn and steadily increases to {{convert|40|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} by sunset, before they cool off at night again.&lt;ref name=roberts86 /&gt; Maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals; to assist this, camels have a [[rete mirabile]], a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Nature's Giants&quot;&gt;[[Inside Nature's Giants]].  Channel 4 (UK) documentary. Transmitted 30 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Camels rarely sweat, even when ambient temperatures reach {{convert|49|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=nationalgeo-dromedary&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabian (Dromedary) Camel|accessdate=25 November 2012|publisher=National Geographic Society|work=National Geographic|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/dromedary-camel/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat; the [[heat of vaporization]] therefore comes from body heat rather than ambient heat. Camels can withstand losing 25% of their body weight to sweating, whereas most other mammals can withstand only about 12–14% dehydration before [[Congestive heart failure|cardiac failure]] results from circulatory disturbance.&lt;ref name=mares99/&gt;

When the camel exhales, [[water vapor]] becomes trapped in their [[nostrils]] and is reabsorbed into the body as a means to conserve water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/12/travel/a-pilgrimage-to-a-mystic-s-hermitage-in-algeria.html |title=A Pilgrimage To A Mystic's Hermitage In Algeria|newspaper=The New York Times |date=12 July 1981 |accessdate=7 March 2009| first=Paul | last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camels eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies' hydrated state without the need for drinking.&lt;ref name=fao94&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0690e/t0690e09.htm|title=A manual for primary animal health care worker|chapter=Camels, llamas and alpacas|year=1994|issn=1020-5187|series=FAO Animal Health Manual|publisher=FAO Agriculture and Consumer Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camels' mouths have a thick leathery lining, allowing them to chew thorny desert plants. Long eyelashes and ear hairs, together with nostrils that can close, form a barrier against sand. If sand gets lodged in their eyes, they can dislodge it using their [[Nicitating membrane|transparent third eyelid]].

Camels' [[immune system]] differs from those of other mammals. Normally, the Y-shaped [[antibody]] molecules consist of two heavy (or long) chains along the length of the Y, and two light (or short) chains at each tip of the Y. Camels, in addition to these, also have antibodies made of only two heavy chains, a trait that makes them smaller and more durable. These &quot;heavy-chain-only&quot; antibodies, discovered in 1993, are thought to have developed 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago, after camelids split from ruminants and pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koenig |first1=R. |title=VETERINARY MEDICINE: 'Camelized' Antibodies Make Waves |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5855 |page=1373 |year=2007 |pmid=18048665 |doi=10.1126/science.318.5855.1373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions concerning camel domestication in [[Mesopotamia]] are often related to mentions of camels in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

Martin Heide's 2010 work on the domestication of the camel tentatively concludes that the bactrian camel was domesticated by at least the middle of the third millennium somewhere east of the [[Zagros Mountains]], then moving into Mesopotamia, and suggests that mentions of camels &quot;in the patriarchal narratives may refer, at least in some places, to the Bactrian camel.&quot; while noting that the camel is not mentioned in relationship to Canaan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heide | first1 = Martin | year = 2011 | title = The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible | url = | journal = Ugarit-Forschungen | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 367–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] by Lidar Sapir-Hen and Erez Ben-Yosef discovered what may be the earliest domestic camel bones found in Israel or even outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BC. This garnered considerable media coverage as it was described as evidence that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasson|first=Nir|title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=Haaretz|date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sapir-Hen 2013 277–285&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapir-Hen|first=Lidar|author2=Erez Ben-Yosef|title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley|journal=Tel Aviv|year=2013|volume=40|pages=277–285|url=http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2014|doi=10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of camels in Mesopotamia but not in Israel is not a new idea. According to an article in [[Time Magazine]], the historian [[Richard Bulliet]] wrote in his 1975 book &quot;The Camel and the Wheel&quot; that &quot;the occasional mention of camels in patriarchal narratives does not mean that the domestic camels were common in the Holy Land at that period.&quot;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|last=Dias|first=Elizabeth|title=The Mystery of the Bible’s Phantom Camels|url=http://world.time.com/2014/02/11/the-mystery-of-the-bibles-phantom-camels/|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=Time|date=Feb 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologist [[William F. Albright]] writing even earlier saw camels in the Bible as an anachronism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heide | first1 = Martin | year = 2011 | title = The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible | url = | journal = Ugarit-Forschungen | volume = 42 | issue = | page = 368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The official report by Sapir-Hen and Ben-Joseph notes that &quot;The introduction of the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) as a pack animal to the southern Levant signifies a crucial juncture in the history of the region; it substantially facilitated trade across the vast deserts of Arabia, promoting both economic and social change (e.g., Kohler 1984; Borowski 1998: 112-116; Jasmin 2005). This, together with the depiction of camels in the Patriarchal narrative, has generated extensive discussion regarding the date of the earliest domestic camel in the southern Levant (and beyond) (e.g., Albright 1949: 207; Epstein 1971: 558-584; Bulliet 1975; Zarins 1989; Köhler-Rollefson 1993; Uerpmann and Uerpmann 2002; Jasmin 2005; 2006; Heide 2010; Rosen and Saidel 2010; Grigson 2012). Most scholars today agree that the dromedary was exploited as a pack animal sometime in the early Iron Age (not before the 12th century BCE)&quot; and concludes that &quot;Current data from copper smelting sites of the Aravah Valley enable us to pinpoint the introduction of domestic camels to the southern Levant more precisely based on stratigraphic contexts associated with an extensive suite of radiocarbon dates. The data indicate that this event occurred not earlier than the last third of the 10th century BCE and most probably during this time. The coincidence of this event with a major reorganization of the copper industry of the region—attributed to the results of the campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I—raises the possibility that the two were connected, and that camels were introduced as part of the efforts to improve efficiency by facilitating trade.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sapir-Hen 2013 277–285&quot;/&gt;

By at least 1200 BC, the first camel saddles had appeared, and [[Bactrian camels]] could be ridden. The first saddle was positioned to the back of the camel, and control of the Bactrian camel was exercised by means of a stick. However, between 500–100 BC, Bactrian camels attained military use. New saddles, which were inflexible and bent, were put over the humps and divided the rider's weight over the animal. In the seventh century BC, the military Arabian saddle appeared, which improved the saddle design again slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Fagan|editor-first=Brian M|editor-link = Brian M.

When his arrangements were complete, he gave his troops orders to slay all the other Lydians who came in their way without mercy, but to spare Croesus and not kill him, even if he should be seized and offer resistance. The reason why Cyrus opposed his camels to the enemy's horse was because the horse has a natural dread of the camel, and cannot abide either the sight or the smell of that animal. By this stratagem he hoped to make Croesus's horse useless to him, the horse being what he chiefly depended on for victory.

Camel meat is [[halal]] for [[Islam|Muslims]]. However, according to some [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic schools of thought]], a state of impurity is brought on by the consumption of it.

|Sunni Ahadith on drinking camel milk and urine
|A Sahih Hadith found in [[Sahih Bukhari]] says - ''Narrated Anas: The climate of Medina did not suit some people, so the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered them to follow his shepherd, i.e. his camels, and drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). So they followed the shepherd that is the camels and drank their milk and urine till their bodies became healthy. Then they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When the news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) he sent some people in their pursuit. When they were brought, he cut their hands and feet and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron. Qataadah narrated me narrated from Muhammad bin sireen that it was before the revelation of [[hudud]]. ( حَدَّثَنَا مُوسَى بْنُ إِسْمَاعِيلَ، حَدَّثَنَا هَمَّامٌ، عَنْ قَتَادَةَ، عَنْ أَنَسٍ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ أَنَّ نَاسًا، اجْتَوَوْا فِي الْمَدِينَةِ فَأَمَرَهُمُ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنْ يَلْحَقُوا بِرَاعِيهِ ـ يَعْنِي الإِبِلَ ـ فَيَشْرَبُوا مِنْ أَلْبَانِهَا وَأَبْوَالِهَا، فَلَحِقُوا بِرَاعِيهِ فَشَرِبُوا مِنْ أَلْبَانِهَا وَأَبْوَالِهَا، حَتَّى صَلَحَتْ أَبْدَانُهُمْ فَقَتَلُوا الرَّاعِيَ وَسَاقُوا الإِبِلَ، فَبَلَغَ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَبَعَثَ فِي طَلَبِهِمْ، فَجِيءَ بِهِمْ فَقَطَعَ أَيْدِيَهُمْ وَأَرْجُلَهُمْ، وَسَمَرَ أَعْيُنَهُمْ. قَالَ قَتَادَةُ فَحَدَّثَنِي مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ سِيرِينَ أَنَّ ذَلِكَ كَانَ قَبْلَ أَنْ تَنْزِلَ الْحُدُودُ.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnah.com/bukhari/76/9 : Sahih al-Bukhari 5686 : Book 76, Hadith 9 : Vol. 7, Book 71, Hadith 590]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A Sahih Hadith found in [[Sahih Bukhari]] says - ''Narrated Anas: Some people from `Uraina tribe came to Medina and its climate did not suit them, so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (p.b.u.h) allowed them to go to the herd of camels (given as Zakat) and they drank their milk and urine (as medicine) but they killed the shepherd and drove away all the camels. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent (men) in their pursuit to catch them, and they were brought, and he had their hands and feet cut, and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron and they were left in the Harra (a stony place at Medina) biting the stones. (Sree Hadith No. 234, Vol. 1)'' ( حَدَّثَنَا مُسَدَّدٌ، حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى، عَنْ شُعْبَةَ، حَدَّثَنَا قَتَادَةُ، عَنْ أَنَسٍ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ أَنَّ نَاسًا، مِنْ عُرَيْنَةَ اجْتَوَوُا الْمَدِينَةَ، فَرَخَّصَ لَهُمْ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنْ يَأْتُوا إِبِلَ الصَّدَقَةِ فَيَشْرَبُوا مِنْ أَلْبَانِهَا وَأَبْوَالِهَا، فَقَتَلُوا الرَّاعِيَ وَاسْتَاقُوا الذَّوْدَ، فَأَرْسَلَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَأُتِيَ بِهِمْ، فَقَطَّعَ أَيْدِيَهُمْ وَأَرْجُلَهُمْ وَسَمَرَ أَعْيُنَهُمْ، وَتَرَكَهُمْ بِالْحَرَّةِ يَعَضُّونَ الْحِجَارَةَ. تَابَعَهُ أَبُو قِلاَبَةَ وَحُمَيْدٌ وَثَابِتٌ عَنْ أَنَسٍ.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnah.com/bukhari/24/102 : Sahih al-Bukhari 1501 : Book 24, Hadith 102 : Vol. 2, Book 24, Hadith 577]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A Sahih Hadith found in [[Sahih Bukhari]] says - '' Narrated Abu Qilaba: That he was sitting behind `Umar bin `Abdul `Aziz and the people mentioned and mentioned (about at-Qasama) and they said (various things), and said that the Caliphs had permitted it. `Umar bin `Abdul `Aziz turned towards Abu Qilaba who was behind him and said. &quot;What do you say, O `Abdullah bin Zaid?&quot; or said, &quot;What do you say, O Abu Qilaba?&quot; Abu Qilaba said, &quot;I do not know that killing a person is lawful in Islam except in three cases: a married person committing illegal sexual intercourse, one who has murdered somebody unlawfully, or one who wages war against Allah and His Apostle.&quot; 'Anbasa said, &quot;Anas narrated to us such-and-such.&quot; Abu Qilaba said, &quot;Anas narrated to me in this concern, saying, some people came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and they spoke to him saying, 'The climate of this land does not suit us.'

They complained about that to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and he said: &quot;Why don't you go out with our herdsmen and drink the milk and urine of the camels?&quot; They said: &quot;Yes (we will do that).&quot; They went out and drank some of the (camels') milk and urine, and they recovered.

The [[Australian feral camel|largest population of feral camels is in Australia]]. There are around 700,000 feral dromedary camels in central parts of [[Australia]], descended from those introduced as a method of transport in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=cnn10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dolby10 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saalfeld|first1=W.K.|last2=Edwards|first2=GP|issn=1832-6684 |year=2008 |title=Managing the impacts of feral camels in Australia: a new way of doing business|chapter=Ecology of feral camels in Australia |format=DKCRC Report 47 |publisher=Desert Knowledge Cooperative Research Centre |location=Alice Springs |isbn=1-74158-094-3 |url=http://www.desertknowledgecrc.com.au/resource/DKCRC-Report-47-Managing-the-impacts-of-feral-camels-in-Australia_A-new-way-of-doing-business.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This population is growing about 8% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pople | first1 = A.

A small population of introduced camels, dromedaries and Bactrians, wandered through [[Southwest United States]] after having been imported in the 1800s as part of the [[U.S. Camel Corps]] experiment. When the project ended, they were used as draft animals in mines and escaped or were released. Twenty-five U.S. camels were bought and imported to Canada during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name=mantz06/&gt;
