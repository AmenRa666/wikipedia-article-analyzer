'''Africa–China relations''' refers to the historical, political, economic, military, social and cultural connections between [[China]] and the [[Africa|African continent]].

Little is known about ancient relations between China and the African continent, though there is some evidence of early trade connections. Highlights of medieval contacts were the 14th century journey of [[Ibn Battuta]], the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar and traveler, to parts of China;&lt;ref name=Ooi&gt;{{cite book |last=Gin Ooi |first=Keat |title=Southeast Asia: a historical encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor|origyear=2004 |year=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1-57607-770-5 |page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt; the visit of [[Sa'id of Mogadishu]], the [[Somali people|Somali]] scholar and explorer to China;&lt;ref&gt;Between the Middle Ages and modernity: individual and community in the early By Charles H.

Modern political and economic relations commenced in the era of [[Mao Zedong]], the first leader of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], following the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Starting in the 21st century, the modern state of the [[People's Republic of China]] has built increasingly strong economic ties with [[List of African countries|Africa]].  There are an estimated one million Chinese citizens residing in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Africa and China: More than minerals|url=http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21574012-chinese-trade-africa-keeps-growing-fears-neocolonialism-are-overdone-more|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, it has been estimated that 200,000 Africans are working in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;LowendGlobalization&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/99879575/How-Africans-Pursue-Low-End-Globalization-in-Hong-Kong-and-Mainland-China-Journal-of-Current-Chinese-Affairs | title=How Africans Pursue Low-End Globalization in Hong Kong and Mainland China | publisher=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs | year=2012 | accessdate=July 15, 2012 | author=Mathews, Gordon and Yang Yang}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}}

Trade between China and Africa increased by 700% during the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mondediplo.com/2005/05/11chinafrica ''China's trade safari in Africa''] - ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'', May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and China is currently Africa's largest trading partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903392904576510271838147248.html |title= In Africa, U.S. Watches China's Rise|author= Peter Wonacott|date=2011-09-02|accessdate= 2012-07-19|work= [[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Forum on China-Africa Cooperation]] (FOCAC) was established in October 2000 as an official forum to strengthen the relationship. A few [[Western world|Western countries]], such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], have raised concerns over the political, economic and military roles China is playing in the African continent.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasizes China's developmental engagements with Africa, while also stating that China and Africa are making &quot;joint efforts to maintain the lawful rights of developing countries and push forward the creation of a new, fair and just political and economic order in the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ziliao/3602/3604/t18059.htm &quot;China-Africa Relations&quot;], Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, April 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical relations ==
[[File:ShenDuGiraffePainting.jpg|thumb|A [[giraffe]] brought from [[Somalia]] in the twelfth year of Yongle (AD 1415).]]
China and Africa have a [[history of trade]] relations, sometimes through third parties, dating back as far as 202 BC and AD 220.&lt;ref&gt;Snow 1988, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of Africa in Chinese sources was in the ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang|Yu-yang-tsa-tsu]]'' by [[Duan Chengshi|Tuan Ch'eng-shih]] (died 863), a compendium of general knowledge where he wrote about the ''land of Po-pa-li'' (referring to [[Somalia]]).

Archaeological excavations at [[Mogadishu]], Somalia and [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], [[Tanzania]] have recovered many coins from [[China]]. The majority of the [[Ancient Chinese coinage|Chinese coins]] date to the [[Song Dynasty]], although the [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] are also represented, according to [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the 14th century, [[Morocco|Moroccan]] traveler and scholar [[Ibn Battuta]] made a long journey to Africa and Asia. He reached China in April 1345 after a stay in [[India]] before serving as an envoy of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Tughlaq]] of the [[Tughlaq dynasty|Indian Tughlaq dynasty]] to China.&lt;ref name=Ooi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Nine.html |title=Ibn Battuta's Trip: Part Nine - Malaysia and China (1345–1346) |accessdate=2009-03-19 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418073126/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Nine.html |archivedate=April 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangorschools.net/hs/SR/IbnBattutta.html |title=Ibn Battuta and Zheng He, the tourist and the admiral |accessdate=2009-03-19 |work= }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;China is the safest, best regulated of countries for a traveler. A man may go by himself on a nine-month journey, carrying with him a large sum of money, without any fear. Silk is used for clothing even by poor monks and beggars. Its porcelains are the finest of all makes of pottery and its hens are bigger than geese in our country.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ming Dynasty]] voyages of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[admiral]] [[Zheng He]] and his fleet, which rounded the coast of [[Somalia]] and followed the coast down to the [[Mozambique Channel]]. The goal of those expeditions was to spread [[Chinese culture]] and signal Chinese strength. Zheng brought gifts and granted titles from the Ming emperor to the local rulers, with the aim of establishing a large number of [[List of tributaries of Imperial China#Ming dynasty|tributary states]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CCTV&quot;/&gt; In October 1415, Chinese explorer and admiral [[Zheng He]] reached the eastern coast of Africa and sent the first of two giraffes as gifts to the Chinese [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Snow 1998, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some other accounts that mention Chinese ships sinking near [[Lamu Island]] in [[Kenya]] in 1415. Survivors are said to have settled in the island and married local women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Charles |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The East African Protectorate |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1966 |publisher=Routledge |location= |language= |isbn=0-7146-1661-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=11 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ke.china-embassy.org/eng/sbgx/t202741.htm |title=Kenyan girl with Chinese blood steals limelight |accessdate=2009-04-03 |work=Chinese Embassy in Kenya |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508162350/http://ke.china-embassy.org/eng/sbgx/t202741.htm |archivedate=2013-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists have found Chinese porcelains made during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) in Kenyan villages; however, these were believed to have been brought over by [[Zheng He]] during his 15th century ocean voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=People's Daily|date=2006-11-03|accessdate=2009-03-30|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200611/03/eng20061103_317869.html|title=Children of the master voyager?}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Lamu Island]] off the Kenyan coast, local [[oral tradition]] maintains that 20 shipwrecked Chinese sailors, possibly part of Zheng's fleet, washed up on shore there hundreds of years ago. Given permission to settle by local tribes after having killed a dangerous python, they [[Religious conversion#Conversion to Islam|converted]] to [[Islam]] and married local women. Now, they are believed to have just six descendants left there; in 2002, DNA tests conducted on one of the women confirmed that she was of Chinese descent.

[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] also published an article by Frank Viviano in July 2005, he visited [[Pate Island]] during the time he stayed on Lamu, ceramic fragments had been found around Lamu which the administrative officer of the local Swahili history museum claimed were of Chinese origin, specifically from [[Zheng He]]'s voyage to east Africa. The eyes of the Pate people resembled Chinese and Famao and Wei were some of the names among them which were speculated to be of Chinese origin. Their ancestors were said to be from indigenous women who intermarried with Chinese Ming sailors when they were shipwrecked. Two places on Pate were called &quot;Old Shanga&quot;, and &quot;New Shanga&quot;, which the Chinese sailors had named. A local guide who claimed descent from the Chinese showed Frank a graveyard made out of coral on the island, indicating that they were the graves of the Chinese sailors, which the author described as &quot;virtually identical&quot;, to Chinese Ming dynasty tombs, complete with &quot;half-moon domes&quot; and &quot;terraced entries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/asia/china/zheng-he-text/6|title=China's Great Armada, Admiral Zheng He|author=Frank Viviano|newspaper=NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC|date=July 2005|page=6|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Melanie Yap and Daniel Leong Man in their book &quot;Colour, Confusions and Concessions: the History of Chinese in South Africa&quot;, Chu Ssu-pen, a Chinese mapmaker, in 1320 had southern Africa drawn on one of his maps. Ceramics found in Zimbabwe and South Africa dated back to [[Song dynasty]] China. Some tribes to Cape Town's north claimed descent from Chinese sailors during the 13th century, their physical appearance is similar to Chinese with paler skin and a Mandarin sounding tonal language. Their name for themselves is &quot;abandoned people&quot;, Awatwa in their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1828432,00.html|title=A Chinese Color War|author=Alex Perry|newspaper=TIME|date=August 1, 2008|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary relations ==

The establishment of modern Sino-African relations dates back to the late 1950s when China signed the first official bilateral trade agreement with [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Guinea]], [[Somalia]], [[Morocco]] and [[Sudan]]. [[Zhou Enlai]] made a ten-country tour to Africa between December 1963 and January 1964. Relations at that time were often reflective of [[Foreign relations of the People's Republic of China|China's foreign policy]] in general: China  &quot;began to cultivate ties and offer&amp;nbsp;... economic, technical and military support to African countries and liberation movements in an effort to encourage [[wars of national liberation]] and revolution as part of an international united front against both superpowers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Muekalia 2004, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diplomacy ===

[[File:China's permanent seat in the UN in Africa and the diplomatic game of &quot;two Chinas&quot; in Africa.jpg|thumb|right|China's permanent seat in the UN in Africa and the diplomatic game of &quot;two Chinas&quot; in Africa]]
Early modern bilateral relations were mainly affected by the [[Cold War]] and the [[communist]] ideology. China originally had close ties with the [[apartheid|anti-apartheid]] and [[liberation movement]], [[African National Congress]] (ANC), in [[South Africa]], but as China's relations with the [[Soviet Union]] worsened and the ANC moved closer to the Soviet Union, China shifted away from the ANC towards the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan-Africanist Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 2000, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; China adopted several principles, among them supporting the independence of African countries while investing in infrastructure projects. The [[Somali Democratic Republic]] established good relations with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War era. When Somalia sought to create a [[Greater Somalia]], it [[Ogaden War|declared war]] on [[Ethiopia]], with the aid of the [[Soviet Union]], Somalia took the [[Ogaden region]] in three months, but the Soviet Union shifted its support from Somalia to Ethiopia, and Ethiopia retook the Ogaden region. This angered [[Siad Barre]], and expelled all Soviets advisors and citizens from Somalia, but Somalia maintained good relations with China, which [[Sino-Soviet Split|segrated]] with the traditional [[Marxism–Leninism|Russian Communism]]. During the [[Cold War]] a few smaller nations also entered in alliances with China, such as [[Burundi]] under [[Michel Micombero]].

[[Political status of Taiwan|The question]] of [[Taiwan]] has been a key political issue for the People's Republic of China (PRC). In 1971, the support of African nations was crucial in the PRC joining the [[United Nations]] (UN), taking over the seat of the ROC on Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eg.china-embassy.org/eng/zagx/t274327.htm |title=From &quot;brothers&quot; to &quot;partners&quot;: China, Africa building strategic ties|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Arab Republic of Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while many African countries such as Algeria, Egypt and [[Zambia]] have stressed their support to &quot;one-China policy&quot;, others such [[Swaziland]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[The Gambia]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] are maintaining relations with [[Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/22427 |title=China woos Taiwan's African friends|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=afrol.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the quest of a permanent UN seat for Africa, [[Nigeria]], the largest African country, relies on Chinese support while [[Egypt]] looks to U.S. backing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/aumonitor/27913 |title=Africa and the UN Security Council Permanent Seats|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=pambazuka.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, around 40 African heads of state have visited the PRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/ziliao/3602/3604/t18059.htm |title=China-Africa Relations |accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=Ministry of ''Foreign Affairs'', the People's Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministerial meeting, [[Forum on China-Africa Cooperation]] (FOCAC), held in Beijing in October 2000 was the first collective dialogue between the PRC and African nations.

As for [[fish]] products, [[Namibia]] remains one of the main{{Quantify|date=March 2009}} providers.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;&lt;!-- Does &quot;large&quot; mean &quot;20%&quot; like it does for cotton or does it mean &quot;large&quot; like &quot;a majority&quot;? Very fuzzy wording in this paragraph. --&gt;

During the year 2011, trade between Africa and China increased a staggering 33% from the previous year to US $166 billion. This included Chinese imports from Africa equalling US $93 billion, consisting largely of mineral ores, petroleum, and agricultural products and Chinese exports to Africa totalling $93 billion, consisting largely of manufactured goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;China and Africa trade&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joc.com/global-trade/china-africa-trade-booms |title= China and Africa trade }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outlining the rapidly expanding trade between the African continent and China, trade between these two areas of the world increased further by over 22% year-over-year to US $80.5 billion during the first five months of the year 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;China and Africa trade&quot;/&gt; Imports from Africa were up 25.5% to $49.6 billion during these first five months of 2012 and exports of Chinese-made products, such as machinery, electrical and consumer goods and clothing/footwear increased 17.5% to reach $30.9 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;China and Africa trade&quot;/&gt; China remained Africa's largest trading partner during 2011 for the fourth consecutive year (starting in 2008).

The need to protect China's increased investments in Africa have driven a shift away from China's traditional non-interference in the internal matters of other countries to new diplomatic and military initiatives to try to resolve unrest in [[South Sudan]] and [[Mali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/04/24/chinas_african_adventure |title=China's African Adventure |last1=Johnson |first1=Keith |date=24 April 2014 |website=www.foreignpolicy.com |publisher=Graham Holdings Company |accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the December 2015 FOCAC meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged $60 billion over a three-year deal in loans and assistance to the African continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.reuters.com us-china-africa-idUSKBN0TN0MD20151204&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = China's Xi cheers African leaders with pledge of $60 billion for development|url = http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-africa-idUSKBN0TN0MD20151204|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-12-04|access-date = 2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China's effort is to support factories manufacturing goods for export.  Along with roads and ports, Nigerian President [[Muhammadu Buhari]] showed his desire to finish stalled railway projects along the coastline, specifically a 1400&amp;nbsp;km railway from [[Lagos]] to [[Calabar]] representing approximately 200,000 jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Buhari Meets With Chinese President Xi Jinping In South Africa|url = http://saharareporters.com/2015/12/04/buhari-meets-chinese-president-xi-jinping-south-africa|website = Sahara Reporters|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aid ===
China strongly supported [[African Independence Movements]] and gave aid to newly independent African nations in the 1960s and 1970s. Among the most notable early projects was the 1,860&amp;nbsp;km [[TAZARA Railway]], linking [[Zambia]] and [[Tanzania]], which China helped to finance and build from 1970 to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brautigam|Brautigam 2010]]: 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;   Some 50,000 Chinese engineers and workers sent to the continent to complete the project. By 1978, China was giving aid to more African countries than the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brautigam|Brautigam 2010]]: 42&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health care ===
China has been engaged in a kind of &quot;[[health]] diplomacy&quot; towards Africa since the 1960s. [[Health care]] development and medical assistance have been one of the main successful areas of cooperation.&lt;!-- Is &quot;cooperation&quot; the right word here?  Seems more like &quot;aid&quot; or &quot;assistance&quot;. --&gt; Between the early 1960s and 2005, more than 15,000 [[Health care in China|Chinese doctors]] have been sent to Africa to help treat different cases{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;!-- &quot;cases&quot; of what? --&gt; in more than 47 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=3901 |title=China's soft power in Africa: From the &quot;Beijing Consensus&quot; to health diplomacy|accessdate=2009-03-14 |last=Thompson |first=Drew |work=jamestown.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical teams, known as ''yiliaodui'', have treated more than 170 million patients during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/health/187358.htm |title=Medical Teams Continue to Help Africa |accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=china.org.cn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the member nations of G8, formed the United Nations-backed [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] with an initial budget of $10 billion. In 2007, another additional $1.1 billion was approved in [[Kunming]], China, of which 66% was dedicated to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA481365&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |title=China, U.S. and Africa: Competition or Cooperation?|accessdate=2009-03-14 |publisher=The Defense Technical Information Center p.17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of the same year, China promised the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to build 31 hospital units and 145 smaller health care centers, a project due to be completed in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/21/news/letter.php |title=The Chinese and Congo take a giant leap of faith|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=iht.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/congo/2008/0701coppercolony.htm |title=Copper Colony in Congo|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=Le Monde diplomatique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
Military cooperation goes back to the Cold War period when China was keen to help [[Decolonization of Africa#Timeline|African liberation movements]]. Apart from some traditional allies such as [[Somalia]] and [[Uganda]], China also had military ties with [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned countries]] such as Egypt. Military equipment worth $142 million was sold to African countries between 1955 and 1977.&lt;ref name=MondeDiplo/&gt; Two decades after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], military relations are now{{Update after|2010|11}} based on business interests rather than ideology.

More recently, China has sent troops to the continent to participate in [[peacekeeping]].  In 2004, China deployed around 1,500 military personnel under the UN umbrella, dispatched between [[Liberia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MondeDiplo&quot; /&gt; though only since 2011 has it sent infantry troops describable (arguably) as 'combat' forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://complex.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/15/chinas_combat_troops_in_africa|title = China's Combat Troops in Africa|date = July 15, 2013|accessdate = 31 August 2014|website = The Complex|publisher = |last = Reed|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China also has [[military attaché]]s 14 attachés in 14 different African countries as of 2007, while there are 18 African countries who maintain their attachés in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/china/if08ad02.html |title=Military backs China's Africa adventure|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=Asia Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from peacemaking, China provides military training and equipment to a few countries, though this does not require military forces to be deployed.  During the December 2015 FOCAC meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, Chinese President Xi Jinping restated &quot;China strongly believes Africa belongs to the African people and African problems should be handled by the African people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.reuters.com us-china-africa-idUSKBN0TN0MD20151204&quot;/&gt;  China's latest military efforts are to combat terrorist radicalism, and not the local African conflicts.

An increasing number of African countries have shifted their source of supply from traditional providers such as [[Russia]] to China due in part to the competitive prices offered by Chinese suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upiasia.com/Security/2008/12/19/russian_chinese_weapons_compete_in_africa/5472/ |title=Russian, Chinese weapons compete in Africa|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=upiasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arms sales by China to some African states have troubled Western critics who point out some buyers like [[Sudan]] are accused of war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7503428.stm |title=China 'is fuelling war in Darfur'|accessdate=2009-03-14 |publisher=BBC | date=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to critics, [[Carter Ham]], a former US Army General in charge of [[U.S. Africa Command]], spoke in favor of the benefits and potential cooperation between China and the US in the African military sphere, offering as examples Chinese supplied patrol boats to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo|DRC]] military and building by Chinese contractors of a military institute in Tanzania as Chinese hardware that could be combined with US training to form joint assistance for African militaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africom.mil/Newsroom/Article/8639/transcript-general-ham-discusses--34-africom-persp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Meetings/Meeting%20Transcripts/161112HamQA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===
[[File:Liuxueksheng.jpg|thumb|Foreign students at [[Huazhong Agricultural University]], [[Wuhan]]]]
Africa is a host of three Chinese cultural centers. The first overseas Chinese center was opened in [[Mauritius]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/culture/2009-02/17/content_17288743.htm |title=Out of Africa|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=China Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other followed in Egypt and [[Benin]]. The [[Confucius Institute]], which focuses on the promotion of the [[Chinese language]] and [[Culture of China|culture]], has 20 centers distributed around 13 African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/4406/2009/02/17/1122s454769.htm |title=Confucius Institute Bridges Friendship between China and Africa|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=cri.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, little is known about early African immigration to China. Due to recent developments in relations,{{Ambiguous|date=July 2011}}&lt;!-- There needs to be an explanation of the immigration laws here, I think --&gt; many{{Quantify|date=March 2009}} have been relocating for better opportunities. Places dubbed 'Little Africa' and 'Chocolate city' are increasingly receiving new immigrants, mostly Nigerians. Most of the African immigrants are concentrated in the area of [[Guangzhou]] with an estimated number of 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/02/09/090209fa_fact_osnos |authorlink=Evan Osnos|date=2009-02-09|author=Evan Osnos|title=The Promised Land|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there are around 10,000 illegal African immigrants in China and police crackdowns have intensified since early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/china-and-its-neighbors/090219/chinas-little-africa-under-pressure |title=China's 'Little Africa' is under pressure |accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=globalpost.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228140945/https://www.globalpost.com:80/dispatch/china-and-its-neighbors/090219/chinas-little-africa-under-pressure |archivedate=2009-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, early Chinese immigration to the African continent is slightly better documented. In 1724, a few Chinese convicts were brought as labourers to [[South Africa]] from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]) by the colonial [[Dutch Empire]]. In the early 19th century, another wave of immigrants came to South Africa as workers brought by the [[British people|British]] to work in agriculture, infrastructure building and mining.&lt;ref name=migration&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=690 |title=China and Africa: Stronger Economic Ties Mean More Migration|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=Migration Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been an increasing presence of [[Chinatowns in Africa|Chinese in Africa]] with one estimate numbering Chinese nationals at one million.

== Criticism ==
There are a variety of critical perspectives scrutinizing the Chinese role in the relationship focused on the balance of the power relationship and human rights. Western countries have been the main source of accusations that China is a [[neo-colonialism|neo-colonist]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3642345/Why-China-is-trying-to-colonise-Africa.html |title=Why China is trying to colonise Africa |accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=telegraph.co.uk | location=London | first=David | last=Blair | date=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/HK03Cb04.html |title=China as Africa's 'angel in white'|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=Asia Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to such criticism, China issued the ''Nine Principles to Encourage and Standardise Enterprises' Overseas Investment'', a charter and guide of conduct to Chinese companies operating abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/archives/acts/forestfortrees-sautman.pdf |title=The Forest for the Trees: Trade, Investment and the China-in-Africa Discourse |accessdate=2009-03-14 |format=pdf |work=Barry Sautman, Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology Yan Hairong, University of Hong Kong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The China-Zimbabwe relationship drew the attention of such critics. China was accused of supplying Zimbabwe with jet fighters, vehicles and other military equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/18/china.armstrade |title=Chinese ship carries arms cargo to Mugabe regime|accessdate=2009-03-14 |format= |work=guardian.co.uk | location=London | first=David | last=Beresford | date=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; China declared in 2007 that it was dropping all kinds of assistance and limiting assistance to [[humanitarian aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1561824/China-is-to-withdraw-backing-for-Mugabe.html |title=China is to withdraw backing for Mugabe|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=telegraph.co.uk | location=London | first=Richard | last=Spencer | date=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, the Chinese diplomacy asked Mugabe &quot;to behave&quot; though critics see that as a way for China to protect its own interests in this country should a regime change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/2461693/Robert-Mugabe-forced-into-talks-with-opposition-after-China-told-him-to-behave.html |title=Robert Mugabe forced into talks with opposition after China told him 'to behave'|accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=telegraph.co.uk | location=London | first=Ian | last=Evans | date=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another high-profile event involving critics of China in Africa was in the run-up to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].  Human rights groups criticized China for its supportive relationship with the government of Sudan, which is accused of mass killings in [[Darfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3847 |title=Why China Won't Save Darfur|accessdate=2009-03-14 |format= |work=Foreign Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080501faessay87306/andrew-s-natsios/beyond-darfur.html |title=Beyond Darfur -  Sudan's Slide Toward Civil War |accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=Foreign Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt; China is Sudan's largest economic partner, with a 40% share in their oil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Business_and_Human_Rights/The_Big_4/page.do?id=1081006&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=26 |title=The &quot;Big 4&quot; – How oil revenues are connected to Khartoum |accessdate=2009-03-14 |format= |work=Amnesty International USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also sells Sudan small arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2008/gb20080314_430126.htm?chan=globalbiz_asia+index+page_economics+%2Bamp%3B+policy |title=Oil for China, Guns for Darfur |accessdate=2009-03-14 |format= |work=businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt; China has threatened to veto [[UN Security Council]] actions to combat the Darfur crisis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/wr2k5/darfur/3.htm |title=The United Nations and Darfur |accessdate=2009-03-14 |work=Human Rights Watch }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has argued that, &quot;As the Darfur issue is not an internal affair of China, nor was it caused by China, to link the two together is utterly unreasonable, irresponsible and unfair.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D7B8BB0F-B5D3-40DA-8123-C7A7AA6A3FDC.htmm |title=China: Darfur-Olympic link 'unfair'|accessdate=2009-03-14 |format= |work=aljazeera.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms are economic in nature including the claim that African markets are harmed by low-cost Chinese-made products, which put great competitive pressure on local industries and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpc.edu/~gpcglobe/Forms/ChinainAfrica.pdf |title=China in Africa - Is China Gaining Control of Africa's Resources |accessdate=2009-03-14 |format=pdf |work=Golobal Researcher }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some argue that PRC's involvement currently benefits primarily the elites, there have been instances of economic trickle-down effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fes-sambia.org/media/publications/FES_China_Africa_Report%20_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
