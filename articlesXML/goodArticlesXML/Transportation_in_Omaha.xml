'''Transportation in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]''', includes most major modes, such as [[pedestrian]], [[bicycle]], [[automobile]], [[bus]], [[train]] and [[airplane]]. While early transportation consisted of [[ferry|ferries]], [[stagecoach]]es, [[steamboat]]s, [[street railroad]]s, and [[railroad]]s, the city's transportation systems have evolved to include the [[Interstate Highway System]], parklike [[Boulevards in Omaha|boulevards]] and a variety of bicycle and pedestrian [[Trails in Omaha|trails]]. The historic head of several important [[emigrant]] [[trail]]s and the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], its center as a national transportation hub earned Omaha the nickname &quot;Gate City of the West&quot; as early as the 1860s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mullens, P.A. 1901 p 24&quot;&gt;Mullens, P.A. (1901) ''Biographical Sketches of Edward Creighton and John A. Creighton.'' Creighton University. p 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a tumultuous pioneer period characterized by its centrality in proximity to the [[Western United States]], transportation in Omaha demanded the construction of massive warehouses where frontier settlers could stock up and communities west of Omaha got food and supplies to build themselves with. Riverboats and stagecoaches jammed the riverside city with a variety of newcomers, prospectors and shady characters. Early Omaha also landed the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] headquarters, leading to its important place in national railroad lore.

After quickly growing into a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic transportation system was highlighted by several miles of successful [[horsecar]] tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) of [[cable car]] service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including [[Dundee, Nebraska|Dundee]], [[Benson, Nebraska|Benson]] and [[Kountze Place]]. In the early 1880s an extensive [[boulevard]] system was built to create a [[park]]-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The [[Trans-Mississippi Exposition]] in 1889 led to the construction of many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent [[Burlington Station (Omaha, Nebraska)|Burlington Station]].

In the 1930s the city's transportation system was marred by violent protests. Transit workers wanted to unionize, and with the main company's management against any effort to change Omaha's reputation as a non-unionized city. After the introduction of [[bus]]es in the early 1950s, streetcars were closed down, and in the last years of the decade the city began construction on its components in the [[Interstate Highway System]].

Today Omaha's transportation system is growing with the city, and [[trail]]s for bicycles and pedestrians, as well as [[public transportation]], [[highway]]s and parkways, and other innovations are being developed. The city has a section of the [[Lincoln Highway]] listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and there are more than {{convert|100|mi|km}} of [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate]] and [[freeway]] lanes, more than any other area in the state of Nebraska.&lt;ref name=&quot;omaha.com&quot;&gt;O'Connor, M.

==Pioneer period==
[[File:TranscontinentalPoster.jpg|right|thumb|A period [[Union Pacific]] poster advertising their route from [[Omaha]].]]

Omaha was not projected to become a great city or bigger than its neighbor across the [[Missouri River]], [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. In 1856 a land speculator reported to his [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] concerns that, 
:&quot;C. Bluffs is steadily growing down towards the river and someday it will be one great city on both sides the river with Rail Road &amp; foot &amp; Carriage Bridges connecting the two â€“ and this is now the hope and talk of the Bluffers.&quot; - J. Barker, 1856.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omahahistory.org/BestofBarkers.pdf &quot;Best of the Barker Letters.&quot;] Douglas County Historical Society. Retrieved 9/26/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1859 [[Abraham Lincoln]] visited land he had invested in Council Bluffs, and while there did not consider it worth the time to cross the river to the village of Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Cottrell. (1997) p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water traffic===
{{further|Port of Omaha}}
In 1804, fifty years before the city of Omaha was founded, the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] first arrived via the Missouri River. The 1806 [[Fort Lisa (Nebraska)|Fort Lisa]] and 1820 [[Cabanne's Trading Post]] were important [[fur trading]] outposts located in proximity to the river, along with earlier [[Fontenelle's Post]] in [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]]. The [[Engineer Cantonment]] was built by Captain [[Stephen Watts Kearny]]'s [[Yellowstone Expedition]] in 1819. The Expedition's craft, the ''[[Western Engineer]]'', was the first steamboat to successfully venture up the Missouri River to the Omaha-Council Bluffs area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omahariverfront.com/articles2003/20030603_rvrhistory.htm &quot;184 Years of Lost American History is Emerging from Local Missouri River Soil&quot;]. OmahaRiverFront.com. Retrieved 9/25/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Missouri was the reason Omaha was founded, and continued to be important to the city's growth for many years. In 1853 [[William D. Brown]] had the first vision for the city, leading him to found the [[Lone Tree Ferry]] crossing the [[Missouri River]] from [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. Later the [[Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company]] hired [[Alfred D. Jones]] to [[plat]] Omaha City, which was among the first settlements in the [[Nebraska Territory]]. Along with the Lone Tree Ferry Landing in [[Downtown Omaha]], other ferries were established in the Omaha area at [[Florence, Nebraska|Florence]], [[Saratoga, Nebraska|Saratoga]] and [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]]. Large steamboats would carry provisions up the Missouri from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], stocking the warehouses in [[Jobbers Canyon]] and loading the trains of the Union Pacific and at the [[Omaha Quartermaster Depot]], which in turn supplied the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[Department of the Platte]].

The ''Banner State'' was the first steamboat to land materials for building the city in early 1854, before the city was formally founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamboats.org/history-education/capt-william-rodney-massie.html &quot;History of Captain William Massey&quot;] Steamboats.org. Retrieved 9/25/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1879 Captain [[Joseph La Barge]] was the principal figure among the Missouri steamboat captains in the early years of the city. According to [[J. Sterling Morton]], the golden era for steamboating on the Missouri was from 1855 to 1860, just before the advent of the railroads.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, J. and Watkins, A. (1918) [http://www.rootsweb.com/~neresour/OLLibrary/MWHNE/mwhne086.htm &quot;Old Trading Post - Bellevue in 1856,&quot;] ''History of Nebraska from the Earliest Explorations of the Trans-Mississippi Region''. Lincoln, NE: Western Publishing and Engraving Company. p. 86. Retrieved 7/15/07.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857, 174 steamboats carrying 13,000 tons of freight tied up at Omaha wharves. When Omaha became the outfitting center for [[Colorado]] [[gold]] seekers headed for [[Pikes Peak]] in 1859, 268 steamboats arrived at Omaha between March and November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omahahistory.org/Education_Timeline3.htm &quot;Omaha Timeline&quot;] Omaha Public Library. Retrieved 9/25/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

With railroads becoming the dominant form of long-range shipping and passenger travel in the early 1870s, riverboats like those in Omaha became obsolete. However, as late at 1949 the steamship ''Avalon'' was letting passengers in Omaha, before becoming one of the famous St. Louis steamboats in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belleoflouisville.org/history.php &quot;History - Belle of Louisville.&quot;] Retrieved 9/25/07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicomaha.com/chap17.htm &quot;Chapter XVII: Romance of Omaha.&quot;] ''Omaha World-Herald.

{{main|Railroads in Omaha}}

In 1863, ground was broke near [[River City Star|Miller's Landing]] on the Missouri River for the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. Along with local financier [[Edward Creighton]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mullens, P.A. 1901 p 24&quot;/&gt; [[George Francis Train]] was the promoter who was mostly responsible for the city landing the railroad. He was made rich from its convenient placement near land that he owned (near [[Deer Park (Omaha, Nebraska)|Deer Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D.L. (2002) ''A dirty, wicked town: Tales of 19th century Omaha.'' Caxton Press. p 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] has been headquartered in Omaha since its inception in 1867. In 1872, Union Pacific opened the first [railroad] bridge across the Missouri to Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, L.H. and Cottrell, B.J. (1997) ''The Gate City: A history of Omaha.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trails===
In the 1860s and 1870s, the city became a major [[outfitting]] center for the major trails that went across Nebraska, including the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], [[California Trail|California]] and [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]] [[Trail]]s. [[Jobbers Canyon]] was built in [[Downtown Omaha]] for the purpose of outfitting these migrants. Stagecoach lines had arrived by 1858, including the [[Local Stage Coach Company]] in 1857, and the [[Western Stage Company]] which began its easterly and westerly routes in Omaha. The [[Pony Express]] and [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]] lines maintained offices in the city.

===Streets===
{{main|List of streets in Omaha, Nebraska}}

Omaha had terrible streets through the late 1880s, which caused many residents to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the [[Government of Omaha|city government]] was caused by property owners throughout the city who did not want to pay for improvements. On rainy days [[stagecoach]]es would sink up to their [[hubcaps]], and residents wore [[knee]]-high boots to wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Cottrell. (1997) p 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transportation===
In 1867 [[Ezra Millard]], [[Andrew J. Hanscom]], and [[Augustus Kountze]] formed the [[Omaha Horse Railway Company]] to provide [[horsecar]] service in the city. By the late 1870s the line had five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) of track, 10 cars, 70 horses, 20 employees and 495,000 passengers annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larsen and Cottrell. 1997 p 106&quot;&gt;Larsen and Cottrell. (1997) p 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Omaha Cable Tramway Company]] was the city's only [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]], and started in 1884 and ended in 1895 after consolidating with the Horse Railway as the [[Omaha Street Railway Company]]. In 1896 the new company disbanded as competitors moved in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omahahistory.org/Education_Timeline6.htm &quot;Omaha Timeline.&quot;] Douglas County Historical Society.

{{further|Boulevards in Omaha}}

In 1880 only a quarter mile of Omaha's estimated {{convert|118|mi|km}} of streets were paved. In 1883 Andrew Rosewater, brother of newspaper owner [[Edward Rosewater]], became city engineer and began an ambitious project to modernize city streets. By 1886 the city had {{convert|44|mi|km}} of paved streets, including [[asphaltum]], Colorado [[sandstone]], Sioux Falls [[granite]] and [[wood]]en blocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larsen and Cottrell. 1997 p 106&quot;/&gt;

In 1889 [[Horace W.S. Cleveland]] proposed that the city of Omaha develop a series of &quot;broad ornamental avenues, known as boulevards or parkways&quot; designed &quot;with a tasteful arrangement of trees and shrubbery at the sides and in the center&quot;, similar to the comprehensive plans of European cities in the mid-19th century. His plan was accepted by the city's Parks Commission, resulting in the construction of [[Omaha's Prettiest Mile Boulevard]] in 1892, and dozens of other boulevards in the through to the present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.omaha.ne.us/parks/Suburban%20Master%20Plan/2006%20Suburban%20Park%20Boulevards%20Design%20Standards.pdf &quot;Omaha's Suburban Park Plan&quot;].

While the [[Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge]] was the first railroad bridge across the river, the {{convert|1400|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Douglas Street Bridge]] opened in 1888 as the first road bridge. The [[East Omaha Bridge]] was originally opened in 1893, and rebuilt a decade later in 1903. The [[Mormon Bridge (Omaha)|Mormon Bridge]] was first attempted to be built across the river in 1932, and failed; it was finally successfully constructed in 1952. The [[South Omaha Bridge]] opened in 1936. The [[Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben]] operated the [[Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge|Douglas Street Bridge]] as a [[toll bridge]] from 1938 to 1947.  The bridge was removed in 1968. Traffic was carried by a new [[girder bridge]] built in 1966 for [[Interstate 480 (Iowa-Nebraska)|I-480]].{{clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omahapubliclibrary.org/earlyomaha/bridges/douglasbridge.html Douglas Street Bridge.] Omaha Public Library.

In 1889 Otto Baysdorfer built Omaha's first auto, an [[electric car]]. The &quot;Ottomobile&quot; was the first of nearly a dozen car manufacturers eventually started in Omaha. The Ottomobile weighed 265 pounds, had two cylinders, and could achieve a speed of 15&amp;nbsp;miles per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omahahistory.org/Education_Timeline7.htm &quot;Omaha Timeline,&quot;] Douglas County Historical Society. Retrieved 9/23/07.&lt;/ref&gt; An &quot;[[Auto Row]]&quot; developed along Farnam Street and featured dealers, garages, and parts stores.

The original [[Lincoln Highway (Omaha)|Lincoln Highway in Omaha]] was designated through Omaha in 1913. Crossing the [[Missouri River]] into Omaha on the old Douglas Street Bridge, it traveled west on Dodge Street, then meandered across the state following [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] lines. Some of these sections were built exclusively to accommodate the highway.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) [http://www.iup.edu/geography/faculty/lhpdf/resourceguide/CH12%20Lincoln%20Highway%20in%20Nebraska.pdf &quot;Chapter 12: Lincoln Highway in Nebraska,&quot;] ''The Lincoln Highway Resource Guide.'' p 157.

In 1930 49,128 autos were registered in Omaha; ten years later 65,489 were registered to drive on local streets.

After [[truck]]s became popular in the 1910s, the Omaha Stockyards grew exponentially. [[Cattle]], [[Pig|hogs]] and [[sheep]] were shipped cheaper by truck than by trains. In 1919 27% of livestock at the Stockyards was shipped by truck; by 1940's it rose to over 75%. In 1955 the Stockyards became the biggest livestock distribution center in the United States, and almost all of the cattle was shipped by truck.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J.

===Airport===
{{main|Eppley Airfield}}
The aforementioned Baysdorfer provided Omaha with another invention by successfully flying an [[airship]] in the city in 1889. In 1929 a bond was passed that would construct the [[Omaha Municipal Airport]] in [[East Omaha, Nebraska|East Omaha]]. This was thought to embody the city's hope for the future; however, air travel did not become popular in Omaha until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Cottrell. (1997) p 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The land was swampy and had to be filled in with silt taken from the bottom of [[Carter Lake (Iowa-Nebraska)|Carter Lake]]. Northwest Airlines started service between Minneapolis and Omaha in 1930.

In the late 1940s Eppley Airfield was completed. In 1959 the airport was named for [[Eugene C. Eppley]], the Omaha Eppley Hotel magnate. Eppley's estate donated $1 million to be used to convert the Omaha Municipal Airport into a jet port.&lt;ref&gt;(1959) &quot;Eppley Grant of $1 Million Gives Omaha Jet Field&quot;.

===Public transportation===
The [[Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company]] was founded in 1886 in order to span the [[Missouri River]].&lt;ref&gt;Orr, R. (1996) ''O&amp;CB: Streetcars of Omaha and Council Bluffs.'' p 154.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1880s the city had five [[government-granted monopoly|franchise]] companies providing transit services within city limits. They included the Omaha and Southwestern Street Railway Company, which provided services to [[Kountze Place]], [[Dundee, Nebraska|Dundee]], [[Bemis Park]] and the [[Gold Coast Historic District (Omaha, Nebraska)|Gold Coast]] neighborhoods. Short lines ran with limited purposes: one went only to a baseball field at the end of its line, while another ran to and from a park.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Cottrell. (1997) p 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1901 local businessman [[Gurdon W. Wattles]] consolidated several of the older horsecar and cable car companies to create the [[Omaha and Council Bluffs Streetcar Company]], which later became the [[Omaha Traction Company]]. After receiving a 30-year franchise from the city of Omaha, the company established a [[mass transit]] system that covered the entire city, including [[commuter train]]s and [[interurban]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, L.H. and Cottrell, B.J. (1997) ''The Gate City: A history of Omaha.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Traction Company strike====
Wattles was vehemently opposed to [[unionization]], and in 1909 fought [[Strike action|strikes]] in favor of unionization with hired [[policemen]] and rampant violence. By 1934 the [[Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees]] was organized in Omaha.

However, by April 1935 the fragile truce between pro-[[open shop]] management and pro-union forces broke. A long, violent strike ensued. [[Strikebreaker]]s were hired, and within four days the company rolled out heavily fortified streetcars, complete with windows covered by heavy wire and armed guards on board.  While few cars attracted passengers, the cars encountered little resistance. The company resisted calls for [[arbitration]] from the [[Omaha City Council]], and continued employing strikebreakers. In early May violence broke out, with rifle attacks, violent beatings and bombings across the city. In June riots broke out throughout the city with mobs burning streetcars, looting and two deaths. The city government lost control of the violence and called in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], which sent 1,800 troops while [[Governor of Nebraska|Governor]] [[Robert Leroy Cochran|Robert Cochran]] declared [[martial law]] and ordered the streetcars to stop running. After the governor intervened and Wattles allowed arbitration, a number of agreements were made. However, no changes occurred, and strikebreakers stayed on the job. The violence ended, court cases ensued, and the situation slowly faded away. The Omaha Traction Company never unionized.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen and Cottrell (1997) p 202-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omaha Belt Line===
{{main|Omaha Belt Line}}

The Omaha Belt Line was formed in 1883 by the [[Union Pacific]]; some shady dealings by [[Jay Gould]] brought the Belt Line into the control of the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] by 1885, when it was constructed with Union Pacific materials under the control of the MoPac. Stations along with Line included the [[Florence Depot]], [[Webster Street Station]] and the [[Ralston Station]]. Operated by that company until the early 1960s, today the Line is largely abandoned, with a section redeveloped into the recreational [[MoPac Trail]].

===Streets===
Starting in 1950 the city has continuously developed and redeveloped its major streets, particularly relying on them for east-west traffic. Major east-west thoroughfares in Omaha include [[Fort Street (Omaha Nebraska)|Fort]], [[Ames Avenue (Omaha, Nebraska)|Ames]], [[Maple Street (Omaha Nebraska)|Maple]], [[Blondo Street|Blondo]], [[Dodge Street|Dodge]], [[Pacific Street|Pacific]], [[Center Street (Omaha Nebraska)|Center]], [[L Street|L]], [[Q Street|Q]] and [[Harrison Street|Harrison]] streets. Major north-south thoroughfares in Omaha include [[North 24th Street|North]] and [[South Omaha Main Street Historic District|South]] 24th streets, 30th street, [[Saddle Creek Road (Omaha, Nebraska)|Saddle Creek Road]], and 72nd, 84th, 90th, and 120th streets. [[South 10th Street]] is important in South Omaha.

===Highways===
[[File:Omaha, Nebraska 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|thumb|250px|Early planned routes for Omaha's Interstate highways.]]
{{further|Interstate 80 in Nebraska}}

The first long segment of [[Interstate 80 in Nebraska]] to be opened was a fifty-mile section between Dodge Street in Omaha and the [[Lincoln, Nebraska|West Lincoln]] interchange in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;(1961) ''[http://www.nebraskatransportation.org/history/docs/1961-I-80-omaha-lincoln.pdf  Nebraska Interstate 80 Lincoln - Omaha].'' Nebraska Department of Roads. Retrieved 9/23/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the [[freeway]] in [[North Omaha]] in the 1970s faced many hurdles. Built immediately after the construction of I-480, this {{convert|4|mi|km|sing=on}} section was originally supposed to be designated as [[Interstate 580 (Nebraska)|Interstate 580]]. However, the city refused to invest the additional money the federal government required in order to gain the designation. Coupled with social unrest in the 1970s, the highway is blamed for causing a 30 percent housing loss and major increase in crime.&lt;ref&gt;(2001) [http://pio.neded.org/press/2001/01rel21.htm State's top community development projects honored]. Nebraska Department of Economic Development. Retrieved 4/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt; The freeway became the route of [[U.S. Highway 75]] and is known locally as the North Freeway.

Today, Omaha is well connected to the [[Interstate Highway System]]. The city has eleven [[highway exit]]s along Interstate 80. From that Interstate drivers can connect to [[Nebraska Highway 50]], [[U.S. Route 275|US 275]]/[[Nebraska Highway 92|NE 92]], [[Interstate 680 (Iowa-Nebraska)|I-680]] and [[Interstate 480 (Iowa-Nebraska)|I-480]]/[[U.S. Route 75|US 75]]. Continuing north, I-680 connects with [[I-29]] near [[Crescent, Iowa]] and reconnects with I-80 near [[Neola, Iowa]]; I-480 cuts through [[Downtown Omaha]] to connect with I-29 in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. The North Freeway also veers from I-480, and in 2005, the [[Nebraska Department of Roads]] began a project to bring the I-480/US 75 interchange up to Interstate standards.  Construction is expected to be complete in 2009, and it is unknown if the North Freeway will receive an Interstate designation upon completion of the project.

There are a number of important arterial roads throughout Omaha. [[U.S. Route 75]] comes south through Omaha from [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]] along North 30 Street, North Freeway, I-480 and Kennedy Freeway, exiting through [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]]. [[U.S. Route 6]] crosses into the city from Council Bluffs on I-480, also called the [[Gerald R. Ford]] Freeway in honor of the Omaha native son. It then follows Dodge Street, until it intersects South 204th Street, when it runs south towards [[Gretna, Nebraska|Gretna]]. [[Nebraska Highway 64]] assumes the route of the former Military Road northwest out of Omaha, following Maple Road and West Maple Road to converge with US 275 at [[Waterloo, Nebraska|Waterloo]]. US 275 becomes [[Nebraska Highway 92]] after crossing the [[South Omaha Veterans Memorial Bridge]], following Missouri Avenue, which then becomes &quot;L&quot; Street. At South 132nd Street, at which point it veers northeast to follow the old [[Mormon Trail]] along Industrial Road when it joins West Center Road, crossing the [[Platte River]] and continuing westward.

In 2005 a [[Lincoln Highway (Omaha)|portion of the Lincoln Highway in Omaha]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

====Traffic monitoring====
Beginning in fall 2007 there will be more than 30 [[traffic camera]]s operating on Omaha area freeways, including one at I-80 near Gretna and another on West Dodge near 120th Street. Operated by the [[Nebraska Department of Roads]], the sensors and cameras are not used to catch [[speeder]]s or for other [[traffic enforcement]]. The state also operates an extensive traffic operations center that utilizes the cameras to monitor Omaha traffic patterns. Similar to traffic monitoring centers in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] and [[North Platte, Nebraska|North Platte]], the one in Omaha is the biggest and has the greatest capability to provide traffic information.&lt;ref name=&quot;omaha.com&quot;/&gt;

===Public transportation===
[[File:South-omaha-bridge.jpg|thumb|450px|center|The [[South Omaha Veterans Memorial Bridge]] from the [[Nebraska]] side.]]

The Omaha Traction Company, which operated as the Street Railway Company, changed its name to the Omaha Transit Company when streetcar service ended in the city in 1952. After [[World War II]] Omahans preferred their automobiles and new highways. When the [[Urban Mass Transit Act]] of 1964 was passed, Omaha's private transit companies were not able to apply for federal [[subsidy|subsidies]] available to [[public transit]] operators. The Omaha Transit Company ceased operations on June 30, 1972, when the City of Omaha assumed authority for [[public transportation]] in the city. City Transit Lines, another private company in Omaha, went out of business on that day as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroareatransit.com/html/history.html &quot;History of MAT&quot;], Metro Area Transit. Retrieved 9/24/07.&lt;/ref&gt; The Metro Area Transit Authority was created by the [[Nebraska Legislature]], consisting of a five-member board appointed by the mayor and confirmed by Omaha's City Council and the [[Douglas County Commissioners]]. It acquired the assets of the Omaha Transit Company and selected assets of the City Transit Lines of Council Bluffs, along with more than $3,000,000 in federal funding. The Authority operates today as [[Metro Area Transit]], or MAT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroareatransit.com/html/savedmetro.html &quot;Saved Metro Area Transit.&quot;] MAT. Retrieved 9/25/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Authority supervises the level of service, miles and hours of operation within Omaha, and maintains individual service [[contract]]s with local authorities outside Omaha. Currently, MAT has three contracts, including the cities of Council Bluffs, Bellevue and the Tri-Communities of [[Ralston, Nebraska|Ralston]], [[LaVista, Nebraska|LaVista]] and [[Papillion, Nebraska|Papillion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroareatransit.com/html/history.html &quot;History,&quot;] Metro Area Transit. Retrieved 9/24/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

MAT recently completed three new [[transit center]]s, which function much like airport hubs. Located at [[Benson Park]], [[Westroads Mall]], and [[Metropolitan Community College (Nebraska)|Metro Community College]] in [[South Omaha]], they are designed to bolster the city's public busing needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livelyomaha.org/Civic_Omaha/Transit_Centers/Transit_Centers.html  &quot;Trio of Omaha Transit Centers Takes Shape&quot;]. Omaha By Design. Retrieved 9/25/07.&lt;/ref&gt; These join existing centers in [[Midtown Omaha|Midtown]] and [[North Omaha]].

====Light rail====
[[File:TRAX train downtown.jpg|thumb|200px|A train in [[Salt Lake City]] similar to what Omaha is considering.]]

In recent years the city of Omaha has grown exponentially, and with a renewed focus on [[public transit]], there have been plans for new [[streetcar]]s and [[light rail]] in the city, including a movement initiated by former mayor [[Hal Daub]], which in a 2003 City Council action, failed to reach approval by only one vote.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, E.C. and Kopiasz, G. (2007) &quot;Light Rail and Omaha: It Takes a Proactive Community to Build Light Rail: the Case for Omaha,&quot; ''New Colonist.'' May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The currently proposed streetcars would cost $55 million and run in a {{convert|3.5|mi|km|sing=on}} loop through [[Downtown Omaha]] and [[NoDo]]. It would cost about $2 million per year to operate and would serve almost 7,000 passengers in its first year. One route would run the cars from [[Creighton University]] near 20th and Webster streets, proceeding east to 10th Street, passing by the [[Qwest Center]] and moving south to Jackson Street in the [[Old Market (Omaha, Nebraska)|Old Market]]. After that it would then move west to 16th Street and then north to Farnam before returning to 10th Street.&lt;ref&gt;Beals, J. [http://omahacityweekly.com/article.php?id=2548 &quot;Streetcar Pool: Omaha moves closer to building a light-rail system&quot;]. ''Omaha City Weekly.'' Retrieved 9/25/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
[[File:Omaha-eppley.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Eppley Airfield]] terminal in Omaha.]]
{{main|Eppley Airfield}}

Today Eppley Airfield sits on {{convert|2650|acre|km2}} and handles approximately 400 flights a week. There are two [[concourse]]s that hold 20 [[gate]]s. The airport handled more than 4.4 million passengers in 2007, and as of September 2008, [[Southwest Airlines]] is the largest carrier handling approximately 24 percent of passengers. [[United Airlines|United]] is the second-largest carrier, handling approximately 19 percent of passengers. Currently, all regularly scheduled flights from Eppley Airfield terminate within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eppleyairfield.com/sf/default.htm &quot;Statistics and facts&quot;], Eppley Airfield. Retrieved 3/29/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Airline]]s serving Omaha include [[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]], [[Allegiant Air]], [[American Airlines|American]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]], and [[United Airlines|United]].

===Trails===
[[File:Chalco Lake and trail.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the [[Trails in Omaha]], located at the [[Chalco Hills Recreation Area]].]]
{{main|Trails in Omaha}}

Omaha was completely devoid of trails leading up to early 1989. That year the city began developing trails, and since then the city of Omaha has developed approximately {{convert|67|mi|km}} of paved recreational trails,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.omaha.ne.us/parks/ Parks and Recreation.] City of Omaha. Retrieved 9/20/07.&lt;/ref&gt; and another {{convert|35|mi|km}} of trails are scheduled for completion within the next eight years.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, D.L. (2001) ''[http://www.unomaha.edu/recadmin/trails/nebtrails.pdf Nebraska Rural Trails: Three Studies of Rail Impact.]'' University of Nebraska at Omaha. p 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paved and unpaved [[trail]]s and paths are used for [[recreation]]al and [[commuter]] purposes throughout the city. Popular among [[bicyclist]]s, [[Running|runners]], [[hiker]]s and recreational [[Pedestrian|walkers]], these trails are included in comprehensive plans for the city of Omaha, the [[Omaha metro area]], [[Douglas County, Nebraska|Douglas County]], and long-distance coordinated plans between the municipalities of southeast [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omahatrails.com/ &quot;Omaha Trails&quot;]. Retrieved 9/18/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Missouri River Pedestrian Bridge]] will connect Miller's Landing to Council Bluffs in 2009. A riverfront trail will run the length of the river from the South Omaha Bridge to [[N.P. Dodge Park]].

===Water traffic===
[[File:River City Star Paddlewheel.jpg|thumb||200px|left|The [[River City Star]].]]

An anomaly in the city's transportation is the [[River City Star]], a passenger excursion [[paddle steamer|paddleboat]] that sails between Omaha and Council Bluffs. The boat is docked at [[River City Star|Miller's Landing]] near the [[Qwest Center]], near mile marker 617 on the Missouri River.

[[Marina]]s for public usage are operated by the [[Omaha Parks and Recreation Department]]. [[Dodge Park]], located in [[North Omaha]], has 326 [[Slipway|slips]], while the new [[Riverfront Marina]] in Downtown Omaha has 31. [[Levi Carter Park]], which has a long history as a water haven, offers non-restricted boating for [[jet ski]]s, recreational [[boat]]ing and [[water ski]]ing. No wake boating allowed available at [[Lake Cunningham]], [[Standing Bear Lake]] or [[Zorinsky Lake]]; however, these lakes offer opportunities for sailing, fishing and pleasure boating. Cunningham Lake offers a small marina where rental boats are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.omaha.ne.us/parks/Marina/marinamaster.htm Marinas and boating]. City of Omaha. Retrieved 9/26/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Port of Omaha]] was located downtown where [[River City Star|Miller's Landing]] is now. In addition to handling outbound [[barge]] shipments of [[grain]], it also handled inbound shipments of [[steel]] and [[asphalt]].&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, L.H., Cottrell, B.J. and Dalstrom, H.A.
