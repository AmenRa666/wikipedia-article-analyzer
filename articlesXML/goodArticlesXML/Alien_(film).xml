'''''Alien''''' is a 1979 British-American [[science fiction film|science fiction]]-[[horror film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]], and starring [[Tom Skerritt]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Veronica Cartwright]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[John Hurt]], [[Ian Holm]] and [[Yaphet Kotto]]. The film's title refers to a highly aggressive extraterrestrial creature that stalks and kills the crew of a spaceship. [[Dan O'Bannon]] wrote the screenplay from a story he wrote with [[Ronald Shusett]], drawing influence from previous works of science fiction and horror. The film was produced by [[Gordon Carroll]], [[David Giler]] and [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]] through their [[Brandywine Productions]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. Giler and Hill made revisions and additions to the script. Shusett was executive producer. The eponymous [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] and its accompanying elements were designed by Swiss [[surrealism|surrealist]] artist [[H. R. Giger]], while concept artists [[Ron Cobb]] and [[Chris Foss]] designed the human aspects of the film. ''Alien'' launched the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]] and is chronologically the first of the main series, with the prequel series set in an earlier timeframe.

''Alien'' received both critical acclaim and box office success, receiving an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]],&lt;ref name=&quot;academy awards database&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Awards database|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |accessdate=September 6, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921143432/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp| archivedate= September 21, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allrovi awards&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=''Alien'': Awards |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/alien-v1503 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saturn Award]]s for [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] for Scott, and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Cartwright,&lt;ref name=&quot;past saturn awards&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Saturn Awards |publisher=The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, &amp; Horror Films |url=http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html |accessdate=September 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914184217/http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html |archivedate=September 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], along with numerous other award nominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb awards&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alien (1979) - Awards |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/awards |accessdate=September 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has remained highly praised in subsequent decades, being considered [[list of films considered the best|one of the greatest films of all time]]. In 2002, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb awards&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;national film registry&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nfpb about&quot; /&gt; In 2008, it was ranked as the seventh-best film in the science fiction genre by the [[American Film Institute]], and as the 33rd greatest film of all time by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFI poll&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Empire 500&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=''Empire's'' The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time |publisher=''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine |date=September 25, 2008 |url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/91.asp |accessdate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Alien'' spawned a media franchise of novels, comic books, video games, and toys. It also launched Weaver's acting career by providing her with her first lead role, and the story of her character [[Ellen Ripley]]'s encounters with the Alien creatures became the thematic thread that ran through the sequels ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992) and ''[[Alien: Resurrection]]'' (1997).&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert 2003 review&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Great Movies: Alien (1979) |publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |date=October 26, 2003 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031026/REVIEWS08/310260301/1023 |accessdate=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crossover with the ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' franchise produced the ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]'' series, which includes ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' (2004) and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007).

==Plot==
&lt;!-- NOTE: The plot summary serves as an overview of the film's events. As per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in a plot section should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
The commercial spacecraft ''Nostromo'' is on a return trip to Earth with a seven-member crew in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]]: Captain Dallas (Skerritt), Executive Officer Kane (Hurt), Navigator Lambert (Cartwright), Science Officer Ash (Holm), Warrant Officer [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]] (Weaver), and Engineers Parker (Kotto) and Brett (Stanton). Detecting a mysterious transmission, possibly a distress signal, from a nearby [[minor planet|planetoid]], the ship's computer, Mother, awakens the crew. Following standard company policy for such situations, the ''Nostromo'' lands on the planetoid, sustaining damage from the planetoid's dusty atmosphere in the process. Parker and Brett begin repairing the ship, while Dallas, Kane, and Lambert head out to investigate. They discover the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft. Inside, they find the remains of a large alien creature whose rib cage appears to have exploded from the inside.

On the ''Nostromo'', Ripley determines that the transmission is not a distress signal but a warning. In the alien ship, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of eggs. As he inspects one, a creature springs out and attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the ''Nostromo''. As acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing [[quarantine]] regulations, but Ash violates protocol by overriding Ripley's lock and letting them in. The crew unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. It detaches on its own and is found dead.

With the ship repaired, the crew lift off. Kane awakens with some memory loss but otherwise unharmed. However, during the crew's final meal before re-entering stasis, he chokes and convulses in pain before a small alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him, and escapes into the depths of the ship. Since attacking the creature with conventional weapons could result in its corrosive blood breaching the ship's hull, the crew attempts to locate and capture it with motion trackers, nets, [[Electroshock weapon|electric prods]], and [[flamethrowers]].

Brett follows the crew's cat, Jones, into an engine room and the now fully grown [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|alien]] (Badejo) attacks him and disappears with his body into the air shafts. After a heated discussion, the group devises a plan to jettison the creature out of the ship. Dallas enters the ''Nostromo''{{'s}} labyrinthine ventilation shafts, intending to force the alien into an [[airlock]], but it ambushes him. Lambert, realizing the alien is killing the crew one by one, implores the others to escape in the ship's shuttle. Now in command, Ripley explains that the shuttle will not support four people, and recommends that they continue with Dallas' plan of flushing the alien out.

Accessing Mother, Ripley discovers that Ash has secretly been ordered to return the alien to the crew's employers, who consider the crew expendable. When Ripley confronts Ash, he tries to choke her to death. Parker intervenes and knocks off Ash's head, revealing him to be an [[Android (robot)|android]]. Parker reanimates Ash's head, and Ripley interrogates him. They learn he was assigned to the ''Nostromo'' to convince the crew to capture the creature and return it for analysis, even at the expense of the human personnel. Ash taunts them about their chances of survival against the &quot;perfect organism.&quot;  Parker turns a flamethrower on Ash.

Ripley, Lambert and Parker agree to set the ''Nostromo'' to self-destruct and escape in the shuttle. However, Parker and Lambert are ambushed and killed by the alien while gathering life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle with Jones, but the alien blocks her path. She retreats and unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct sequence, then returns to retrieve Jones, finding the alien gone. She narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the ''Nostromo'' explodes.

As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers the alien is aboard the shuttle. She dons a spacesuit and opens the shuttle's airlock, causing [[explosive decompression]] which forces the alien into the shuttle's open doorway. She propels it into space by shooting it with a [[grappling hook]], but the gun catches in the closing door, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one of the engines but Ripley then activates them, blasting the alien into space. After recording the ship's final log entry, she places herself and Jones into stasis for the voyage home.

==Cast==
[[File:Alien (1979) - main cast.jpg|right|thumb|alt=The seven principal cast members of the film stand in front of a white backdrop, in costume and holding prop weapons from the film.|The principal cast members of ''Alien'' (left to right: Holm, Stanton, Weaver, Kotto, Skerritt, Cartwright, and Hurt)]]
* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Dallas, the captain of the ''Nostromo''.
:Skerritt had been approached early in the film's development but declined as it did not yet have a director and had a very low budget. Later, when Scott was attached as director and the budget had been doubled, Skerritt accepted the role of Dallas.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;truckers&quot; /&gt;
* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]], the [[warrant officer]] aboard the ''Nostromo''.
:Weaver, who had Broadway experience but was relatively unknown in film, impressed Scott, Giler, and Hill with her audition. She was the last actor to be cast for the film, and performed most of her [[screen test]]s in-studio as the sets were being built.&lt;ref name=&quot;truckers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 30&quot; /&gt; The role of Ripley was Weaver's first leading role in a motion picture, and earned her nominations for a [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]] and a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Role.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb awards&quot; /&gt;
* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Lambert, the ''Nostromo''{{'}}s [[navigator]].
:Cartwright had previous experience in horror and science fiction films, having acted as a child in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1978).&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 17&quot;&gt;Mcintee, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; She originally read for the role of Ripley, and was not informed that she had instead been cast as Lambert until she arrived in London for wardrobe.&lt;ref name=&quot;truckers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29-30&quot;&gt;McIntee, 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; She disliked the character's emotional weakness,&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 30&quot;&gt;McIntee, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; but nevertheless accepted the role: &quot;They convinced me that I was the audience's fears; I was a reflection of what the audience is feeling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;truckers&quot; /&gt; Cartwright won a [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;past saturn awards&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb awards&quot; /&gt;
* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Brett, the engineering technician.
:Stanton's first words to Scott during his audition were &quot;I don't like sci fi or monster movies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29&quot; /&gt; Scott was amused and convinced Stanton to take the role after reassuring him that ''Alien'' would actually be a [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] more akin to ''[[And Then There Were None (1974 film)|Ten Little Indians]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29&quot; /&gt;
* [[John Hurt]] as Kane, the [[executive officer]] who becomes the host for the Alien.
:Hurt was Scott's first choice for the role but was contracted on a film in South Africa during ''Alien''{{'}}s filming dates, so [[Jon Finch]] was cast as Kane instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 30&quot; /&gt; However, Finch became ill during the first day of shooting and was diagnosed with severe [[diabetes]], which had also exacerbated a case of [[acute bronchitis|bronchitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 32&quot; /&gt; Hurt was in London by this time, his South African project having fallen through, and he quickly replaced Finch.&lt;ref name=&quot;truckers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 32&quot; /&gt; His performance earned him a nomination for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]].&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb awards&quot; /&gt; 
* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Ash (Alien)|Ash]], the ship's science officer who is revealed to be an [[Android (robot)|android]].
:Holm, a character actor who by 1979 had already been in twenty films, was the most experienced actor cast for ''Alien'' (he was 46 at the time of filming).&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary&quot; /&gt;
* [[Yaphet Kotto]] as Parker, the chief engineer.
:Kotto, an [[African Americans|African American]], was chosen partly to add diversity to the cast and give the ''Nostromo'' crew an international flavor.&lt;ref name=&quot;truckers&quot; /&gt; Kotto was sent a script off the back of his recent success with ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', although it took some time and deliberation between Kotto and his agent before he was offered the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steve|first=Head|title=An Exclusive Interview with Yaphet Kotto.

* [[Bolaji Badejo]] as [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|The Alien]].
:[[Nigerians|Nigerian]] Badejo, while a 26-year-old design student, was discovered in a bar by a member of the casting team, who put him in touch with Ridley Scott.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 30&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;8th passenger&quot; /&gt; Scott believed that Badejo, at {{convert|6|ft|10|in|cm}} (7ft. inside the costume) and with a slender frame,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Clark|first=Frederick S. |last2= Jones|first2= Alan|date=1979 |title=Bolaji Bodejo: The Alien |url=http://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/interview-with-bolaji-badejo-1979/|journal=Cinefantastique |location=Oak Park, Illinois, USA |publisher=Frederick S.

While studying cinema at the [[University of Southern California]], [[Dan O'Bannon]] had made a science fiction comedy film with director [[John Carpenter]] and [[concept art]]ist [[Ron Cobb]] entitled ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot;&gt;&quot;Star Beast: Developing the Story&quot;, ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''.&lt;/ref&gt; The film included an alien which had been created using a spray-painted [[beach ball]], and the experience left O'Bannon &quot;really wanting to do an alien that looked ''real''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 20&quot; /&gt; A &quot;couple of years&quot; later he began working on a similar story that would focus more on horror: &quot;I knew I wanted to do a scary movie on a spaceship with a small number of astronauts&quot;, he later recalled, &quot;''Dark Star'' as a horror movie instead of a comedy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt; [[Ronald Shusett]], meanwhile, was working on an early version of what would eventually become ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 20&quot; /&gt; Impressed by ''Dark Star'', he contacted O'Bannon and the two agreed to collaborate on their projects, choosing to work on O'Bannon's film first as they believed it would be less costly to produce.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 20&quot; /&gt; O'Bannon had written twenty-nine pages of a script titled ''Memory'' comprising what would become the film's opening scenes: a crew of astronauts awaken to find that their voyage has been interrupted because they are receiving a signal from a mysterious planetoid. They investigate and their ship breaks down on the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 20&quot; /&gt; He did not yet, however, have a clear idea as to what the alien antagonist of the story would be.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;

O'Bannon soon accepted an offer to work on [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s film adaptation of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', a project which took him to Paris for six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 21&quot;&gt;McIntee, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose works gave him ideas for his science-fiction story including [[Chris Foss]], [[H. R. Giger]], and [[Jean Giraud|Jean &quot;Moebius&quot; Giraud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt; O'Bannon was impressed by Foss's covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work &quot;disturbing&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt; &quot;His paintings had a profound effect on me. I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt; After the ''Dune'' project collapsed O'Bannon returned to Los Angeles to live with Shusett and the two revived his ''Memory'' script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about [[gremlin]]s infiltrating a [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 bomber]] during [[World War II]], and set it on the spaceship as the second half of the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 21&quot; /&gt; The [[working title]] of the project was now ''Star Beast'', but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to ''Alien'' after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the script. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning as both a [[noun]] and [[adjective]].&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 21-22&quot;&gt;McIntee, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be implanted with an alien embryo that would later burst out of him, feeling that this was an interesting [[plot device]] by which the alien creature could get aboard the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 21&quot; /&gt;

{{Quote box| quote=Dan [O'Bannon] put his finger on the problem: what has to happen next is the creature has to get on the ship in an interesting way. I have no idea how, but if we could solve that, if it can't be that it just snuck in, then I think the whole movie will come into place. In the middle of the night, I woke up and I said, &quot;Dan I think I have an idea: the alien screws one of them [...] it jumps on his face and plants its seed!&quot; And Dan says, oh my god, we've got it, we've got the whole movie.|source=—Screenwriter Ron Shusett&lt;ref name=&quot;Alien evolution documentary&quot;&gt;{{cite video |title=Alien Evolution|medium=DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc. |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alien saga documentary&quot;&gt;{{cite video |title=Alien Saga|medium=DVD |publisher=Prometheus Entertainment |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=30em |quoted=1}}

In writing the script, O'Bannon drew inspiration from many previous works of science fiction and horror. He later stated that &quot;I didn't steal ''Alien'' from anybody. I stole it from ''everybody''!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 19&quot;&gt;McIntee, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951) inspired the idea of professional men being pursued by a deadly alien creature through a claustrophobic environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 19&quot; /&gt; ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956) gave O'Bannon the idea of a ship being warned not to land, and then the crew being killed one by one by a mysterious creature when they defy the warning.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 19&quot; /&gt; ''[[Planet of the Vampires]]'' (1965) contains a scene in which the heroes discover a giant alien [[skeleton]]; this influenced the ''Nostromo'' crew's discovery of the alien creature in the derelict spacecraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 19&quot; /&gt; O'Bannon has also noted the influence of &quot;Junkyard&quot; (1953), a short story by [[Clifford D. Simak]] in which a crew lands on an asteroid and discovers a chamber full of eggs.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 20&quot;&gt;McIntee, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also cited as influences ''Strange Relations'' by [[Philip José Farmer]] (1960), which covers alien reproduction, and various [[EC Comics]] horror titles carrying stories in which monsters eat their way out of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 20&quot; /&gt;

With roughly eighty-five percent of the plot completed, Shusett and O'Bannon presented their initial script to several studios,&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt; pitching it as &quot;''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' in space.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hays&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Hays |first=Matthew |title=A space odyssey |work=[[Montreal Mirror]] |date=October 23, 2003 |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2003/102303/film1.html |accessdate=September 6, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905074007/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2003/102303/film1.html| archivedate= September 5, 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were on the verge of signing a deal with [[Roger Corman]]'s studio when a friend offered to find them a better deal and passed the script on to [[Gordon Carroll]], [[David Giler]], and [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]], who had formed a production company called Brandywine with ties to [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 24&quot; /&gt; O'Bannon and Shusett signed a deal with Brandywine, but Hill and Giler were not satisfied with the script and made numerous rewrites and revisions to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 25&quot;&gt;McIntee, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused tension with O'Bannon and Shusett, since Hill and Giler had very little experience with science fiction and according to Shusett: &quot;They weren't good at making it better, or in fact at not making it even worse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt; O'Bannon believed that they were attempting to justify taking his name off of the script and claiming it as their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt; Hill and Giler did add some substantial elements to the story, however, including the [[Android (robot)|android]] character Ash which O'Bannon felt was an unnecessary subplot,&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Dan O'Bannon]] (Writer), [[Ridley Scott]] (Director), [[Sigourney Weaver]] (Actor) |title=Alien |medium=DVD (audio commentary track) |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc. |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which Shusett later described as &quot;one of the best things in the movie...That whole idea and scenario was theirs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt; In total Hill and Giler went through eight different drafts of the script, mostly concentrating on the Ash subplot but also making the dialogue more natural and trimming some sequences set on the alien planetoid.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 26&quot; /&gt;

Despite the multiple rewrites, 20th Century Fox did not express confidence in financing a science-fiction film. However, after the success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977 the studio's interest in the genre rose substantially. According to Carroll: &quot;When ''Star Wars'' came out and was the extraordinary hit that it was, suddenly science fiction became the hot genre.&quot; O'Bannon recalled that &quot;They wanted to follow through on ''Star Wars'', and they wanted to follow through fast, and the only spaceship script they had sitting on their desk was ''Alien''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt; ''Alien'' was [[greenlight|greenlit]] by 20th Century Fox at an initial budget of $4.2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;star beast&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 26&quot; /&gt; ''Alien'' was funded by American dollars, but made by Twentieth Century-Fox's British production subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-british-sci-fi-films|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|title=10 great British sci-fi films|last=Oliver|first=John|date=3 March 2015|accessdate=12 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427201637/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-british-sci-fi-films|archivedate=April 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direction===
[[File:Ridley Scott by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Director [[Ridley Scott]] ]]
O'Bannon had originally assumed that he would direct ''Alien'', but 20th Century Fox instead asked Hill to direct.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 26&quot;&gt;McIntee, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot;&gt;&quot;The Visualists: Direction and Design&quot;, ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''.&lt;/ref&gt; Hill declined due to other film commitments as well as not being comfortable with the level of visual effects that would be required.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 26-27&quot;&gt;McIntee, 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Yates]], [[Jack Clayton]], and [[Robert Aldrich]] were considered for the task, but O'Bannon, Shusett, and the Brandywine team felt that these directors would not take the film seriously and would instead treat it as a [[B movie|B monster movie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 27&quot;&gt;McIntee, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Giler, Hill, and Carroll had been impressed by [[Ridley Scott]]'s debut feature film ''[[The Duellists]]'' (1977) and made an offer to him to direct ''Alien'', which Scott quickly accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 27&quot; /&gt; Scott created detailed [[storyboard]]s for the film in [[London, England|London]], which impressed 20th Century Fox enough to double the film's budget from $4.2&amp;nbsp;million to $8.4&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot; /&gt; His storyboards included designs for the spaceship and [[space suit]]s, drawing influences from films such as ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29&quot; /&gt; However, he was keen on emphasizing horror in ''Alien'' rather than fantasy, describing the film as &quot;''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' of science fiction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 27&quot; /&gt;

[[File:H.R. Giger - Necronom IV.jpg|thumb|Giger's ''Necronom IV'']]
O'Bannon introduced Scott to the artwork of H. R. Giger; both of them felt that his painting ''Necronom IV'' was the type of representation they wanted for the film's antagonist and began asking the studio to hire him as a designer.&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 27&quot; /&gt; 20th Century Fox initially believed Giger's work was too ghastly for audiences, but the Brandywine team were persistent and eventually won out.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 27&quot; /&gt; According to Gordon Carroll: &quot;The first second that Ridley saw Giger's work, he knew that the biggest single design problem, maybe the biggest problem in the film, had been solved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot; /&gt; Scott flew to [[Zürich]] to meet Giger and recruited him to work on all aspects of the Alien and its environment including the surface of the planetoid, the derelict spacecraft, and all four forms of the Alien from the egg to the adult.&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 27&quot; /&gt;

===Casting===
{{details|topic=individual characters|List of Alien characters}}
[[Casting (performing arts)|Casting call]]s and [[audition]]s for ''Alien'' were held in both [[New York City|New York]] and London.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29&quot; /&gt; With only seven human characters in the story, Scott sought to hire strong actors so he could focus most of his energy on the film's visual style.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29&quot; /&gt; He employed casting director [[Mary Selway]], who had worked with him on ''The Duellists'', to head the casting in the United Kingdom, while Mary Goldberg handled casting in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;truckers&quot;&gt;&quot;Truckers in Space: Casting&quot;, ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 14&quot;&gt;McIntee, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In developing the story O'Bannon had focused on writing the Alien first, putting off developing the characters for a later draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot; /&gt; He and Shusett had therefore written all of the roles as generic male ones with a note in the script explicitly stating &quot;The crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;truckers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 22&quot;&gt;McIntee, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; This left Scott, Selway, and Goldberg free to interpret the characters as they liked and to cast accordingly. They wanted the ''Nostromo''{{'}}s crew to resemble working astronauts in a realistic environment, a concept summed up as &quot;truckers in space&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;truckers&quot; /&gt; According to Scott, this concept was inspired partly by ''Star Wars'', which deviated from the pristine future often depicted in science fiction films of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ridley Scott|Scott, Ridley]] | date=2004 |title=The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars |type = ''[[Star Wars]]'' Trilogy DVD box set, audio commentary track |publisher=[[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] and [[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc |location=[[Los Angeles]] &lt;!--|accessdate=August 2, 2008--&gt; |quote=Within the context of that fantasy {{bracket|[[George Lucas]]}} said people still have to wash behind their ears at night. That was another wonderful touch. It influenced me when I did ''Alien''. I thought I better push it a bit further and make them truck drivers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To assist the actors in preparing for their roles, Ridley Scott wrote several pages of backstory for each character explaining their histories.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 26&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fear of the unknown&quot;&gt;&quot;Fear of the Unknown: Shepperton Studios, 1978&quot;, ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''.&lt;/ref&gt; He filmed many of their rehearsals in order to capture spontaneity and improvisation, and tensions between some of the cast members, particularly towards the less-experienced Weaver, translated convincingly on film as tension between their respective characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;fear of the unknown&quot; /&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] notes that the actors in ''Alien'' were older than was typical in thriller films at the time, which helped make the characters more convincing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
None of them were particularly young. Tom Skerritt, the captain, was 46, Hurt was 39 but looked older, Holm was 48, Harry Dean Stanton was 53, Yaphet Kotto was 42, and only Veronica Cartwright at 30 and Weaver at 29 were in the age range of the usual thriller cast. Many recent action pictures have improbably young actors cast as key roles or sidekicks, but by skewing older, ''Alien'' achieves a certain texture without even making a point of it: These are not adventurers but workers, hired by a company to return 20&amp;nbsp;million tons of ore to Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert 2003 review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David A. McIntee|David McIntee]], author of ''Beautiful Monsters: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to the Alien and Predator Films'', asserts that part of the film's effectiveness in frightening viewers &quot;comes from the fact that the audience can all identify with the characters...Everyone aboard the ''Nostromo'' is a normal, everyday, working Joe just like the rest of us. They just happen to live and work in the future.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 41&quot;&gt;McIntee, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Alien model filming.jpg|thumb|right|alt=In a film studio, a director operates a crane-mounted camera aimed at a large grey model spacecraft, raised several feet in the air by a support structure underneath. The model is lit from one side by bright studio lights and has tall spires with many pieces protruding from them.|Ridley Scott filming model shots of the ''Nostromo'' and its attached ore refinery. He made slow passes filming at 2½ frames per second to give the models the appearance of motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;]]
''Alien'' was filmed over fourteen weeks from July 5 to October 21, 1978. Principal photography took place at [[Shepperton Studios]] near London, while model and miniature filming was done at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] in [[Water Oakley]], [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 14&quot; /&gt; Production time was short due to the film's low budget and pressure from 20th Century Fox to finish on schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;fear of the unknown&quot; /&gt; A crew of over 200 workmen and technicians constructed the three principal sets: The surface of the alien planetoid and the interiors of the ''Nostromo'' and derelict spacecraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Scanlon |first=Paul |author2=Michael Cross |title=The Book of Alien |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |year=1979 |location=[[London]] |isbn=1-85286-483-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art Director Les Dilley created 1/24th scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made [[molding (process)|moulds]] and [[casting|casts]] and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and [[fiberglass]] forms of the sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 29&quot;&gt;McIntee, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt; The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with [[nylon]], had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled [[carbon dioxide]] to escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 33&quot; /&gt; Combined with a [[heat wave]], these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out and nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;fear of the unknown&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 33&quot;&gt;McIntee, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For scenes showing the exterior of the ''Nostromo,'' a {{convert|58|ft|m|adj=on}} landing leg was constructed to give a sense of the ship's size. Ridley Scott still did not think that it looked large enough, so he had his two sons and the son of [[Derek Vanlint]], the cinematographer, stand in for the regular actors, wearing smaller space suits to make the set pieces seem larger.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 33&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot;&gt;&quot;The Darkest Reaches: Nostromo and Alien Planet&quot;, ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''.&lt;/ref&gt; The same technique was used for the scene in which the crew members encounter the dead alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. The children nearly collapsed due to the heat of the suits, and eventually oxygen systems were added to assist the actors in breathing.&lt;ref name=&quot;fear of the unknown&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 33&quot; /&gt; Four identical cats were used to portray Jones, the ''Nostromo'' crew's pet.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 14&quot; /&gt; During filming Sigourney Weaver discovered that she was [[allergy|allergic]] to the combination of cat hair and the [[glycerol|glycerin]] placed on the actors' skin to make them appear sweaty. By removing the glycerin she was able to continue working with the cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 32&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fear of the unknown&quot; /&gt;

''Alien'' originally was to conclude with the destruction of the ''Nostromo'' while Ripley escapes in the shuttle ''Narcissus''. However, Ridley Scott conceived of a &quot;fourth act&quot; to the film in which the Alien appears on the shuttle and Ripley is forced to confront it. He pitched the idea to 20th Century Fox and negotiated an increase in the budget to film the scene over several extra days.&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 35&quot; /&gt; Scott had wanted the Alien to bite off Ripley's head and then make the final log entry in her voice, but the producers vetoed this idea as they believed that the Alien had to die at the end of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 35&quot; /&gt;

===Post-production===
Editing and post-production work on ''Alien'' took roughly twenty weeks to complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt; Terry Rawlings served as Editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for ''[[The Duellists]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt; Scott and Rawlings edited much of the film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: &quot;I think the way we did get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt; The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 40&quot; /&gt;

One scene that was cut from the film occurred during Ripley's final escape from the ''Nostromo'': she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]ed by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an Alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 24&quot;&gt;McIntee, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had &quot;become sort of food for the alien creature&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt; while Ivor Powell suggested that &quot;Dallas is found in the ship as an egg, still alive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt; Scott remarked that &quot;they're morphing, [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]], they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary&quot; /&gt; The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough and partly because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 24&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 35&quot; /&gt; Tom Skerritt remarked that &quot;The picture had to have that pace. Her trying to get the hell out of there, we're all rooting for her to get out of there, and for her to slow up and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt; The footage was included amongst other deleted scenes as a special feature on the [[Laserdisc]] release of ''Alien'', and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 &quot;Director's Cut&quot; which was re-released in theaters and on [[DVD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 24&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;director's cut&quot;&gt;{{cite video |date=December 2, 2003 |title=Alien (Director's Cut) |type = ''[[Alien Quadrilogy]]'', DVD disc 1 |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc |location=[[Los Angeles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{main article|Alien (soundtrack)}}
[[File:Jerry Goldsmith 2.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Jerry Goldsmith composed the music for ''Alien'']]
The musical score for ''Alien'' was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], conducted by [[Lionel Newman]], and performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Ridley Scott had originally wanted the film to be scored by [[Isao Tomita]], but 20th Century Fox wanted a more familiar composer and Goldsmith was recommended by then-President of Fox [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 38&quot; /&gt; Goldsmith wanted to create a sense of romanticism and lyrical mystery in the film's opening scenes, which would build throughout the film to suspense and fear.&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot;&gt;&quot;Future Tense: Music and Editing&quot;, ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott did not like Goldsmith's original main title piece, however, so Goldsmith rewrote it as &quot;the obvious thing: weird and strange, and which everybody loved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 38&quot; /&gt; Another source of tension was editor [[Terry Rawlings]]' choice to use pieces of Goldsmith's music from previous films, including a piece from ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]'', and to use an excerpt from [[Howard Hanson]]'s Symphony No. 2 (&quot;Romantic&quot;) for the end credits.&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 38&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Symphony 2 Howard Hanson |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/nso/Hanson2.htm|publisher=Ukonline.co.uk|accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Great American Composers |url=http://www.classicalcdreview.com/hanson.html|publisher=Classicalcdreview.com|accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott and Rawlings had also become attached to several of the musical cues they had used for the temporary score while editing the film, and re-edited some of Goldsmith's cues and re-scored several sequences to match these cues and even left the temporary score in place in some parts of the finished film.&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt; Goldsmith later remarked that &quot;you can see that I was sort of like going at opposite ends of the pole with the filmmakers of the picture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, Scott praised Goldsmith's score as &quot;full of dark beauty&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 38&quot; /&gt; and &quot;seriously threatening, but beautiful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;future tense&quot; /&gt; It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], a [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album]], and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb awards&quot; /&gt; The score has been released as a [[soundtrack album]] in several versions with different tracks and sequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 38-39&quot; /&gt;

==Design==
[[File:H. R. Giger.jpg|thumb|upright|[[H. R. Giger]], who designed and worked on the Alien and its accompanying elements]]

O'Bannon brought in artists [[Ron Cobb]] and Chris Foss (with whom he had worked on ''Dark Star'' and ''Dune'', respectively) to work on designs for the human aspects of the film such as the spaceship and space suits.&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 28&quot;&gt;McIntee, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb created hundreds of preliminary sketches of the interiors and exteriors of the ship, which went through many design concepts and possible names such as ''Leviathan'' and ''Snark'' as the script continued to develop. The final name of the ship was derived from the title of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1904 novel ''[[Nostromo]]'', while the escape shuttle, called ''Narcissus'' in the script, was named after Conrad's 1897 [[novella]] ''[[The Nigger of the 'Narcissus']]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 15&quot; /&gt; The production team particularly praised Cobb's ability to depict the interior settings of the ship in a realistic and believable manner. Under Ridley Scott's direction the design of the ''Nostromo'' shifted towards an {{convert|800|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} tug towing a refining platform {{convert|2|mi|km}} long and {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt; Cobb also created some conceptual drawings of the Alien, but these were not used.&lt;ref name=&quot;visualists&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 28&quot; /&gt; Moebius was attached to the project for a few days as well, and his costume renderings served as the basis for the final space suits created by costume designer John Mollo.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 28&quot; /&gt;

===Sets===

The sets of the ''Nostromo''{{'}}s three decks were each created almost entirely in one piece, with each deck occupying a separate stage and the various rooms connected via corridors. To move around the sets the actors had to navigate through the hallways of the ship, adding to the film's sense of [[claustrophobia]] and realism.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fear of the unknown&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 31&quot; /&gt; The sets used large [[transistor]]s and low-resolution computer screens to give the ship a &quot;used&quot;, industrial look and make it appear as though it was constructed of &quot;retrofitted old technology&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt; Ron Cobb created industrial-style symbols and color-coded signs for various areas and aspects of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt; The company that owns the ''Nostromo'' is not named in the film, and is referred to by the characters as &quot;the company&quot;. However, the name and logo of &quot;Weylan-Yutani&quot; appears on several set pieces and props such as computer monitors and beer cans.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 15&quot;&gt;McIntee, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb created the name to imply a business alliance between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Japan]], deriving &quot;Weylan&quot; from the [[British Leyland Motor Corporation]] and &quot;Yutani&quot; from the name of his Japanese neighbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 28&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mollo |first=John |author2=[[Ron Cobb]] |title=The Authorized Portfolio of Crew Insignias from the United States Commercial Spaceship Nostromo, Designs and Realizations |quote=I wanted to imply that poor old England is back on its feet and has united with the Japanese, who have taken over the building of spaceships the same way they have now with cars and supertankers. In coming up with a strange company name I thought of [[British Leyland Motor Corporation|British Leyland]] and [[Toyota]], but we couldn't use &quot;Leyland-Toyota&quot; in the film. Changing one letter gave me &quot;Weylan,&quot; and &quot;Yutani&quot; was a Japanese neighbor of mine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1986 sequel ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' named the company as &quot;Weyland-Yutani&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 28&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aliens&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people=[[James Cameron|Cameron, James]] (Director) |title=[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]] |medium=[[DVD]] |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |location=[[Beverly Hills, California]] |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has remained a central aspect of the film franchise.

Art Director [[Roger Christian (filmmaker)|Roger Christian]] used scrap metal and parts to create set pieces and props to save money, a technique he employed while working on ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 31-32&quot;&gt;McIntee, 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ''Nostromo''{{'s}} corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used to create the illusion of longer corridors in the below-deck area.&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt; Special effects supervisors [[Brian Johnson (special effects artist)|Brian Johnson]] and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 32&quot;&gt;McIntee, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;

H. R. Giger designed and worked on all of the alien aspects of the film, which he designed to appear organic and [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] in contrast to the industrial look of the ''Nostromo'' and its human elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt; For the interior of the derelict spacecraft and egg chamber he used dried bones together with [[plaster]] to sculpt much of the scenery and elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt; Veronica Cartwright described Giger's sets as &quot;so erotic...it's big vaginas and penises...the whole thing is like you're going inside of some sort of [[womb]] or whatever...it's sort of visceral&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt; The set with the deceased alien creature, which the production team nicknamed the &quot;space jockey&quot;, proved problematic as 20th Century Fox did not want to spend the money for such an expensive set that would only be used for one scene. Ridley Scott described the set as the [[cockpit]] or driving deck of the mysterious ship, and the production team was able to convince the studio that the scene was important to impress the audience and make them aware that this was not a [[B movie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 34&quot; /&gt; To save money only one wall of the set was created, and the &quot;space jockey&quot; sat atop a disc that could be rotated to facilitate shots from different angles in relation to the actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 34&quot; /&gt; Giger [[airbrush]]ed the entire set and the &quot;space jockey&quot; by hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;darkest reaches&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 34&quot; /&gt;

The origin of the jockey creature was not explored in the film, but Scott later theorized that it might have been the ship's pilot, and that the ship might have been a weapons carrier capable of dropping Alien eggs onto a planet so that the Aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts.&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary&quot; /&gt; In early versions of the script the eggs were to be located in a separate [[pyramid]] structure which would be found later by the ''Nostromo'' crew and would contain statues and [[hieroglyph]]s depicting the Alien reproductive cycle, offering a contrast of the human, Alien, and space jockey cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 21&quot; /&gt; Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and the need to trim the length of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt; Instead the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting the jockey and its chair were removed and the set was redressed to create the egg chamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt; Light effects in the egg chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band [[The Who]]. The band was testing the lasers for use in their stage show in the sound stage next door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alien Vault: The Definitive Story of the Making of the Film|author=Nathan, Ian|publisher=Voyageur Press|date=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spaceships and planets===
{{Quote box |quote=I resent films that are so shallow they rely entirely on their visual effects, and of course science fiction films are notorious for this. I've always felt that there's another way to do it: a lot of effort should be expended toward rendering the environment of the spaceship, or space travel, whatever the fantastic setting of your story should be–as convincingly as possible, but always in the background. That way the story and the characters emerge and ''they'' become more real.|source=—Ron Cobb on his designs for ''Alien''&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot;/&gt;|align=left |salign=right |width=25%}}

The spaceships and planets for the film were shot using models and miniatures. These included models of the ''Nostromo'', its attached mineral refinery, the escape shuttle ''Narcissus'', the alien planetoid, and the exterior and interior of the derelict spacecraft. Visual Effects Supervisor Brian Johnson, supervising modelmaker [[Martin Bower]], and their team worked at Bray Studios, roughly {{convert|25|mi}} from Shepperton Studios where principal filming was taking place.&lt;ref name=&quot;outward bound&quot;&gt;&quot;Outward Bound: Visual Effects&quot;, ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 36&quot;&gt;McIntee, 36&lt;/ref&gt; The designs of the ''Nostromo'' and its attachments were based on combinations of Ridley Scott's storyboards and Ron Cobb's conceptual drawings.&lt;ref name=&quot;outward bound&quot; /&gt; The basic outlines of the models were made of wood and plastic, and most of the fine details were added from [[scale model|model kits]] of warships, tanks, and World War II bombers. Three models of the ''Nostromo'' were made: a {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on}} version for medium and long shots, a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} version for rear shots, and a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}}, {{convert|7|ST|t|adj=on}} rig for the undocking and planetoid surface sequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 36&quot; /&gt; Scott insisted on numerous changes to the models even as filming was taking place, leading to conflicts with the modeling and filming teams. The ''Nostromo'' was originally yellow, and the team filmed shots of the models for six weeks before Johnson left to work on ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Scott then ordered it changed to gray, and the team had to begin shooting again from scratch.&lt;ref name=&quot;outward bound&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 36&quot; /&gt; He ordered more and more pieces added to the model until the final large version with the refinery required a metal framework so that it could be lifted by a [[forklift]]. He also used a hammer and chisel on sections of the refinery, knocking off many of its spires which Bower had spent weeks creating. Scott also had disagreements with miniature effects cinematographer [[Dennis Ayling]] over how to light the models.&lt;ref name=&quot;outward bound&quot; /&gt;

A separate model, approximately {{convert|40|ft|m}} long, was created for the ''Nostromo''{{'s}} underside from which the ''Narcissus'' would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial [[shroud]] out of wood and it was launched through the hatch using a small [[catapult]] and filmed at high speed, then slowed down in editing.&lt;ref name=&quot;outward bound&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 37&quot;&gt;McIntee, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one shot was filmed using [[chroma key|blue screen]] compositing: that of the shuttle racing past the ''Nostromo''. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added via [[multiple exposure|double exposure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 36&quot; /&gt; Though [[motion control photography]] technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow for it. The team therefore used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted on a drive mechanism to make slow passes over and around the models filming at 2½ frames per second,&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt; giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;outward bound&quot; /&gt; For the scene in which the ''Nostromo'' detaches from the refinery, a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The ''Nostromo'' was pushed away from the refinery by the forklift, which was covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;outward bound&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 36&quot; /&gt; Shots from outside the ship in which the characters are seen through windows moving around inside were filmed using larger models which contained projection screens showing pre-recorded footage.&lt;ref name=&quot;outward bound&quot; /&gt;

A separate model was created for the exterior of the derelict alien spacecraft. [[Matte (filmmaking)|Matte paintings]] were used to fill in areas of the ship's interior as well as exterior shots of the planetoid's surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;outward bound&quot; /&gt; The surface as seen from space during the landing sequence was created by painting a [[globe]] white, then mixing chemicals and dyes onto [[transparency (projection)|transparencies]] and projecting them onto it.&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 36&quot; /&gt; The planetoid was not named in the film, but some drafts of the script gave it the name [[Acheron]]&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 30&quot; /&gt; after the river which in [[Greek mythology]] is described as the &quot;stream of woe&quot;, a branch of the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]], and which forms the border of [[Hell]] in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. The 1986 sequel ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' named the planetoid as &quot;LV-426&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;aliens&quot; /&gt; and both names have been used for it in subsequent [[expanded universe]] media such as comic books and video games.

===Creature effects===

[[File:Alien-The Facehugger.png|thumb|right|alt=A man covered with sweat lays on a medical examination table, with a spider-like alien creature covering his face. The creature is beige in color and has four long, thin fingers on either side of its body that grasp tightly around the man's head, and its long tail is coiled around his neck.|The &quot;facehugger&quot; was the first creature Giger designed for the film, giving it human-like fingers and a long tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;8th passenger&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 31&quot; /&gt;]]
The scene of Kane inspecting the egg was shot during post-production. A [[fiberglass]] egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 34&quot; /&gt; The top of the egg opened via hydraulics, and the innards were made of a cow's stomach and [[tripe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;8th passenger&quot;&gt;&quot;The Eighth Passenger: Creature Design&quot;, ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 34&quot; /&gt; Initial test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason a hen's egg was used as the primary image for the film's advertising poster, and became a lasting image for the series as a whole rather than the Alien egg that actually appears in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 34&quot;&gt;McIntee, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;facehugger&quot; and its [[proboscis]], which was made of a sheep's [[intestine]], were shot out of the egg using high-pressure air hoses. The shot was acted out and filmed in reverse, then reversed and slowed down in editing to prolong the effect and show more detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;8th passenger&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 34&quot; /&gt; The facehugger itself was the first creature that Giger designed for the film, going through several versions in different sizes before deciding on a small creature with humanlike fingers and a long tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;8th passenger&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 31&quot; /&gt; Dan O'Bannon drew his own version based on Giger's design, with help from Ron Cobb, which became the final version.&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 31&quot; /&gt; Cobb came up with the idea that the creature could have a powerful acid for blood, a characteristic that would carry over to the adult Alien and would make it impossible for the crew to kill it by conventional means such as guns or explosives, since the acid would burn through the ship's hull.&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 21&quot; /&gt; For the scene in which the dead facehugger is examined, Scott used pieces of fish and [[shellfish]] to create its [[viscus|viscera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;8th passenger&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 34&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Alien-The Chestburster.png|thumb|left|alt=The head and tail of an alien creature is emerging from the ruptured chest cavity of a dead man.

For the filming of the chestburster scene the cast members knew that the creature would be bursting out of Hurt, and had seen the chestburster puppet, but they had not been told that fake blood would also be bursting out in every direction from high-pressure pumps and [[squib (explosive)|squibs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 32&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Making of Alien's Chestburster Scene |date=October 13, 2009 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/oct/13/making-of-alien-chestburster |accessdate=May 29, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430221033/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/oct/13/making-of-alien-chestburster| archivedate=April 30, 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene was shot in one take using an artificial torso filled with blood and viscera, with Hurt's head and arms coming up from underneath the table. The chestburster was shoved up through the torso by a puppeteer who held it on a stick. When the creature burst through the chest a stream of blood shot directly at Veronica Cartwright, shocking her enough that she fell over and went into hysterics.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 32&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;8th passenger&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book of alien&quot; /&gt; According to Tom Skerritt: &quot;What you saw on camera was the real response.

The real-life surprise of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made it one of the film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater so as not to be too close to the screen during the sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 40&quot; /&gt; In subsequent years the chestburster scene has often been voted as one of the most memorable moments in film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Green |first=Graeme |title=John Hurt talks Harry Potter, Flamenco and Chestbursters |publisher=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |date=December 10, 2009 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/805670-john-hurt-talks-harry-potter-flamenco-and-chestbursters |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the British film magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' named it as the greatest [[18 certificate|18-rated]] moment in film as part of its &quot;18th birthday&quot; issue, ranking it above the [[decapitation]] scene in ''[[The Omen]]'' (1976) and the transformation sequence in ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981).&lt;ref name=&quot;empire&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Alien named as top 18-rated scene |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6597295.stm |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |date=April 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial screening of ''Alien'' for 20th Century Fox representatives in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] suffered from poor sound in the theater.

===Box office===
The film was a commercial success, making $78,900,000 in the United States and [[Pound sterling|£]]7,886,000 in the United Kingdom during its first run.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 40&quot; /&gt; It ultimately grossed $80,931,801 in the United States, though international box office figures have varied from $24,000,000 to $122,700,000.

{{Quote box |quote=&quot;The traditional definition of the term 'Director's Cut' suggests the restoration of a director's original vision, free of any creative limitations. It suggests that the filmmaker has finally overcome the interference of heavy-handed studio executives, and that the film has been restored to its original, untampered form. Such is not the case with ''Alien'': The Director's Cut. It's a completely different beast.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;quadrilogy&quot;/&gt; |source=—Ridley Scott |align=right |salign=right |width=25%}}
In 2003 20th Century Fox was preparing the ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD box set, which would include ''Alien'' and its three sequels. In addition, the set would also include alternate versions of all four films in the form of &quot;special editions&quot; and &quot;[[director's cut]]s&quot;. Fox approached Ridley Scott to digitally restore and [[remaster]] ''Alien'', and to restore several scenes which had been cut during the editing process for inclusion in an expanded version of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;quadrilogy&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ridley Scott]] ([[Film director|Director]]) |date=December 2, 2003| title=[[Alien Quadrilogy]] |medium=DVD booklet |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc |location=[[Los Angeles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon viewing the expanded version, Scott felt that it was too long and chose to recut it into a more streamlined alternate version:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Upon viewing the proposed expanded version of the film, I felt that the cut was simply too long and the pacing completely thrown off. After all, I cut those scenes out for a reason back in 1979. However, in the interest of giving the fans a new experience with ''Alien'', I figured there had to be an appropriate middle ground. I chose to go in and recut that proposed long version into a more streamlined and polished alternate version of the film. For marketing purposes, this version is being called &quot;The Director's Cut.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;quadrilogy&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The &quot;Director's Cut&quot; restored roughly four minutes of deleted footage while cutting about five minutes of other material, leaving it about a minute shorter than the theatrical cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 40&quot;&gt;McIntee, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the changes were minor, such as altered sound effects, while the restored footage included the scene in which Ripley discovers the cocooned Dallas and Brett during her escape of the ''Nostromo''. Fox decided to release the Director's Cut in theaters, and it premiered on October 31, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 40&quot; /&gt; The ''Alien Quadrilogy'' box set was released December 2, 2003, with both versions of the film included along with a new commentary track featuring many of the film's actors, writers, and production staff, as well as other special features and a documentary entitled ''The Beast Within: The Making of Alien''. Each film was also released separately as a DVD with both versions of the film included. Scott noted that he was very pleased with the original theatrical cut of ''Alien'', saying that &quot;For all intents and purposes, I felt that the original cut of ''Alien'' was perfect. I still feel that way&quot;, and that the original 1979 theatrical version &quot;remains my version of choice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;quadrilogy&quot; /&gt; He has since stated that he considers both versions &quot;director's cuts&quot;, as he feels that the 1979 version was the best he could possibly have made it at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;quadrilogy&quot; /&gt;

The ''Alien Quadrilogy'' set earned ''Alien'' a number of new awards and nominations. It won DVDX Exclusive Awards for Best Audio Commentary and Best Overall DVD, Classic Movie, and was also nominated for Best Behind-the-Scenes Program and Best Menu Design.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb awards&quot; /&gt; It also won a Sierra Award for Best DVD, and was nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best DVD Collection and Golden [[Satellite Award]]s for Best DVD Extras and Best Overall DVD.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb awards&quot; /&gt; In 2010 both the theatrical version and Director's Cut of ''Alien'' were released on [[Blu-ray Disc]], as a stand-alone release and as part of the ''Alien Anthology'' set.&lt;ref name=&quot;Empire&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=28371 |title=Alien Series Has A Blu-ray Release Date |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sigourney Weaver 1989 Academy Awards.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Sigourney Weaver became the star of the ''Alien'' films, reprising her role as Ripley in three sequels between 1986 and 1997.

The success of ''Alien'' led [[20th Century Fox]] to finance three direct [[sequel]]s over the next eighteen years, each by different writers and directors. [[Sigourney Weaver]] remained the only recurring actor through all four films, and the story of her character [[Ellen Ripley|Ripley]]'s encounters with the [[Alien (Alien franchise)|Alien]]s became the thematic thread running through the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert 2003 review&quot; /&gt; [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) focused more on action and involved Ripley returning to the planetoid accompanied by [[marine (military)|marine]]s to confront hordes of Aliens.&lt;ref name=&quot;aliens&quot; /&gt; [[David Fincher]]'s ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992) had [[nihilism|nihilistic]] tones&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 41&quot; /&gt; and found her on a prison planet battling another Alien, ultimately sacrificing herself to prevent her employers from acquiring the creatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;alien 3&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people=[[David Fincher|Fincher, David]] (Director) |title=[[Alien 3]] |medium=[[DVD]] |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |location=[[Beverly Hills, California]] |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]]'s ''[[Alien: Resurrection]]'' (1997) saw Ripley resurrected through [[cloning]] to battle more Aliens even further in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;alien resurrection&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Jean-Pierre Jeunet|Jeunet, Jean-Pierre]] (Director) |title=[[Alien: Resurrection]] |medium=[[DVD]] |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |location=[[Beverly Hills, California]] |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the film series resulted in the creation of a [[media franchise]] with numerous novels, comic books, video games, toys, and other media and merchandise appearing over the years. A number of these began appearing under the ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]] imprint, which brought the Alien creatures together with the titular [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]s of the [[Predator (franchise)|''Predator'' franchise]]. The film series eventually followed suit, with [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]'s [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|''Alien vs. Predator'']] (2004) and [[Brothers Strause|Colin and Greg Strause]]'s ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007).

Sigourney Weaver has expressed interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another ''Alien'' film. In the 2003 commentary track for the ''Alien'' DVD included in the ''Alien Quadrilogy'' set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: &quot;There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard to come up with a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary&quot; /&gt; Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ridley Scott]] (Director) |title=Alien | medium=DVD (audio commentary track) |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] Home Entertainment, Inc. |date=2003 |quote=It's a tough one, particularly with the success of four.

===Imitations===
{{Quote box |quote=&quot;The 1979 ''Alien'' is a much more cerebral movie than its sequels, with the characters (and the audience) genuinely engaged in curiosity about this weirdest of lifeforms...Unfortunately, the films it influenced studied its thrills but not its thinking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert 2003 review&quot;/&gt; |source=—Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] on ''Alien''{{'}}s cinematic impact. |align=right |salign=right |width=25%}}
''Alien'' had both an immediate and long-term impact on the science fiction and horror genres. Shortly after its debut, [[Dan O'Bannon]] was sued by another writer named Jack Hammer for allegedly plagiarising a script entitled ''Black Space''. However, O'Bannon was able to prove that he had written his ''Alien'' script first.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 40-41&quot;&gt;McIntee, 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of ''Alien''{{'s}} success a number of other filmmakers imitated or adapted some of its elements, sometimes by copying its title. One of the first was ''The Alien Dead'' (1979), which was titled at the last minute to cash in on ''Alien''{{'s}} popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 262&quot;&gt;McIntee, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Contamination (film)|Contamination]]'' (1980) was initially going to be titled ''Alien 2'' until 20th Century Fox's lawyers contacted writer/director [[Luigi Cozzi]] and made him change it, and it built on press coverage of ''Alien''{{'s}} chestburster scene by having many similar creatures, which originated from large, slimy eggs, bursting from characters' chests.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 262&quot; /&gt; An unauthorized sequel to ''Alien'', titled ''[[Alien 2: On Earth]]'', was released in 1980 and included alien creatures which incubate inside human hosts. Other science fiction films of the time that borrowed elements from ''Alien'' include ''[[Galaxy of Terror]]'' (1981), ''[[Inseminoid]]'' (1981), ''[[Forbidden World]]'' (1982), ''[[Xtro]]'' (1982), and ''[[Dead Space (film)|Dead Space]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 262&quot; /&gt;

The film studio [[The Asylum]] has produced two [[mockbusters]] based on the ''Alien'' franchise: ''[[AVH: Alien vs. Hunter]]'' (based on the crossover ''Alien vs. Predator: Requiem'') and ''[[Alien Origin]]'' (based on ''Prometheus'').

===Analysis===
Critics have analyzed ''Alien''{{'s}} sexual overtones. Following Barbara Creed's analysis of the Alien creature as a representation of the &quot;monstrous-feminine as [[archaic mother]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Creed, Barbara. &quot;Alien and The Monstrous-Feminine.&quot; ''Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema''. Ed. [[Annette Kuhn]]. London: Verso, 1990. 128-141.&lt;/ref&gt; Ximena Gallardo C. and C. Jason Smith compared the facehugger's attack on Kane to a male [[rape]] and the chestburster scene to a form of violent [[birth]], noting that the Alien's [[phallus|phallic]] head and method of killing the crew members add to the sexual imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Gallardo C., Ximena and C. Jason Smith (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Alien_Woman.html?id=k_H3vLIRECgC Alien Woman: The Making of Lt. Ellen Ripley]''. &quot;Chapter 1: Men, Women, and an Alien Baby&quot; 13-61. Continuum. ISBN 0-8264-1569-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallardo C., Ximena [http://reconstruction.eserver.org/043/gallardoc.htm &quot;'Who Are You?: Alien/Woman as Posthuman Subject in Alien Resurrection'&quot;]. Reconstruction 4.3 (Summer 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Dan O'Bannon has argued that the scene is a metaphor for the male fear of penetration, and that the &quot;oral invasion&quot; of Kane by the facehugger functions as &quot;payback&quot; for the many horror films in which sexually vulnerable women are attacked by male monsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kermode |first=Mark |title=All Fright on the Night |publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' |date=October 19, 2003 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/oct/19/features.review |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntee claims that &quot;''Alien'' is a rape movie as much as ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971) or ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'' (1978), or ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'' (1988). On one level it's about an intriguing alien threat. On one level it's about [[parasitism]] and disease. And on the level that was most important to the writers and director, it's about sex, and reproduction by non-consensual means. And it's about this happening to a man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 43&quot;&gt;McIntee, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes how the film plays on men's fear and misunderstanding of pregnancy and childbirth, while also giving women a glimpse into these fears.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 43-44&quot;&gt;McIntee, 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Film analyst Lina Badley has written that the Alien's design, with strong [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] sexual undertones, multiple phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an [[androgyny|androgynous]] image conforming to [[archetype|archetypal]] mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;badley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Badley |first=Lina |title=Film, Horror, and the Body Fantastic: Contributions to the Study of Popular Culture |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |year=1995 |location=[[Westport, Connecticut]] |isbn=978-0-313-27523-4 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in ''Alien'' as overt and intentional: &quot;One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm not going to go after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men.

In the decades since its original release, critics have analyzed and acknowledged ''Alien''{{'s}} roots in earlier works of fiction.

Writer [[David A.

===Lasting critical praise===
''Alien'' has continued to receive critical acclaim over the years, particularly for its realism and unique environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;mackinder review&quot; /&gt; It has a 97% approval rating at the online [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 89 reviews,&lt;ref name=&quot;rotten tomatoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alien (1979) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alien/ |accessdate=September 8, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907203516/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alien/| archivedate= September 7, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Metacritic]] gives an 83% approval rating based on 22 reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;metacritic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alien |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/alien?q=alien |accessdate=September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical interest in the film was re-ignited in part by the theatrical release of the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; in 2003. Despite having criticized ''Alien'' in 1980, Roger Ebert included it in his &quot;Great Movies&quot; column in 2003, ranking it among &quot;the most influential of modern action pictures&quot; and praising its pacing, atmosphere, and settings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the great strengths of ''Alien'' is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences (the majestic opening shots are underscored by Jerry Goldsmith with scarcely audible, far-off metallic chatterings). It suggests the enormity of the crew's discovery by building up to it with small steps: The interception of a signal (is it a warning or an [[SOS]]?). The descent to the extraterrestrial surface. The bitching by Brett and Parker, who are concerned only about collecting their shares. The masterstroke of the surface murk through which the crew members move, their helmet lights hardly penetrating the soup. The shadowy outline of the alien ship. The sight of the alien pilot, frozen in his command chair. The enormity of the discovery inside the ship (&quot;It's full of ... leathery eggs ...&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert 2003 review&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
McIntee praises ''Alien'' as &quot;possibly the definitive combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 41&quot; /&gt; He notes, however, that it is a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. ''Alien'', on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: &quot;It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 41&quot; /&gt; Along with ''Halloween'' and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the [[slasher film]] genre: &quot;The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is that it is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 41&quot; /&gt; He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: &quot;Fans of [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the [[hard science fiction]] trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntee, 42&quot;&gt;McIntee, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Edelstein]] wrote, &quot;''Alien'' remains the key text in the 'body horror' subgenre that flowered (or, depending on your viewpoint, festered) in the seventies, and Giger’s designs covered all possible avenues of anxiety. Men traveled through vulva-like openings, got forcibly impregnated, and died giving birth to rampaging gooey vaginas dentate — how’s that for future shock? This was truly what David Cronenberg would call 'the new flesh,' a dissolution of the boundaries between man and machine, machine and alien, and man and alien, with a psychosexual invasiveness that has never, thank God, been equaled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edelstein&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Edelstein |first=David |title=Prometheus Review: More Than Just an Alien |publisher=vulture.com |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/movie-review-prometheus-alien-prequel.html |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
