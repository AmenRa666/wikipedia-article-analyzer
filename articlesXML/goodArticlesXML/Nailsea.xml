'''Nailsea''' is a town in the [[unitary authority]] of [[North Somerset]] in the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Somerset]], England, approximately {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} southwest of [[Bristol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Map showing position of Nailsea relative to Bristol |work = Google Maps| url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=Fe3JEAMdDerV_ynx7TVAXfFxSDHejTP5yzb-pA%3BFVElEQMdYnPY_ylh2LOBZoNxSDEf15pLLrLkjg&amp;q=nailsea+to+bristol&amp;sll=51.446732,-2.719803&amp;sspn=0.106772,0.308647&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.437103,-2.672081&amp;spn=0.106795,0.308647&amp;t=h&amp;z=12&amp;saddr=nailsea&amp;daddr=bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} northeast of the seaside resort of [[Weston-super-Mare]]. The nearest village is [[Backwell]], which lies south of Nailsea on the opposite side of the [[Bristol to Exeter line|Bristol to Exeter railway line]]. Nailsea is a [[bedroom community|commuter town]] with a population of 15,630.&lt;ref name=&quot;popn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Census Profile|url=http://www.n-somerset.gov.uk/Environment/Planning_policy_and-research/researchandmonitoring/Documents/North%20Somerset%20Small%20area%20geography%20profiles%20tool.xls|publisher=North Somerset Council|accessdate=4 January 2014|format=Excel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was an industrial centre based on [[coal mining]] and [[glass]] manufacture, which have now been replaced by service industries. The surrounding [[North Somerset Levels]] has wildlife habitats including the [[Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors SSSI|Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors]] [[biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]] and Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake [[Local Nature Reserve]]. Nailsea is close to the [[M5 motorway]] and [[Bristol Airport]], and its railway station, [[Nailsea and Backwell railway station|Nailsea and Backwell]], has services operated by [[First Great Western]].

Secondary education is provided by [[Nailsea School]] (rebuilt as an Academy in 2009), and primary education by St Francis School, Grove School, Kingshill School and Golden Valley. Churches include the 14th-century [[Holy Trinity Church, Nailsea|Holy Trinity Church]] and Christ Church, which was built in 1843.

==History==
[[File:Nailsea glassblower.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The statue of a glassblower near the site of the glassworks.]]

The name of the town may be derived from the [[Old English]] for ''Naegl's island'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Nottingham's Institute for Name-Studies |title=Nailsea |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~aezins//kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=8067 |accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has also been suggested it was spelt ''Naylsey'' in 1657.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Short History of Nailsea|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/ian.sage/Nailsea/nailsea.html|publisher=Nailsea Parish Family History and OPC|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parish of Nailsea was part of the [[Portbury (hundred)|Portbury]] [[Hundred (county subdivision)|Hundred]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somerset Hundreds|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SOM/Miscellaneous/|publisher=GENUKI|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of the area occupied by Nailsea before the coal mining industry began, although it was used as a quarry in Roman times from which [[Pennant Measures|pennant sandstone]] was extracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Heritage|url=http://www.nailseatowncouncil.gov.uk/history.php|publisher=Nailsea Town Council|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans otherwise ignored Nailsea from 40–400 AD, but left a small villa near [[Jacklands Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nailsea OPC page|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/ian.sage/Nailsea/nailsea.html|work=Nailsea OPC|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nailsea's early economy relied on [[coal mining]], which began as early as the 16th century. The earliest recorded date for [[coal mining]] in Nailsea was 1507 when coal was being transported to light fires at [[Yatton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=N&amp;DLHS&amp;nbsp;– Bottle Green &amp; Coal Black|url=http://www.ndlhs.org.uk/item-coalblack.html|work=Nailsea and District Local History Society|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 1700s the town had a large number of pits. Around this time Nailsea was visited by the social reformer [[Hannah More]] who founded a Sunday school for the workers. The [[Elms Colliery]],(Middle Engine Pit), one of the most complete examples of an 18th-century colliery left in England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heritage at risk|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/HERITAGE-RISK/article-217252-detail/article.html|accessdate=30 June 2010|newspaper=Bristol Evening Post|date=11 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now in disrepair. It has been designated a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] and is included in the [[Heritage at Risk Register]] produced by [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South West England|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/HAR_Register_South_West_2009/southwest-2009-har-register.pdf|work=Heritage at Risk|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=30 June 2010|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of the old pits, most of which had closed down by the late 19th century as mining capital migrated to the richer seams of [[South Wales]], are still visible around the town.

The coal mines attracted [[glass]] manufacturer John Robert Lucas, who in 1788 established the [[Nailsea Glassworks]] that became the fourth-largest of its kind in the United Kingdom, mostly producing low-grade bottle glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nailsea Glass|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/ian.sage/Nailsea/glass.html|publisher=Nailsea Parish Family History and OPC Page|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|title=The Nailsea Glassworks, Nailsea, North Somerset A Study of the History, Archaeology, Technology and the Human Story|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/library/nailsea_avon_2004/index.cfm?CFID=3871270&amp;CFTOKEN=62749229|publisher=Archaeology Data Service (ADS)|accessdate=1 July 2010|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works closed down in 1873, but &quot;Nailsea&quot; glass (mostly made by glass workers at the end of their shift in Nailsea and at other glass works) is still sought after by collectors around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndlhs.org.uk/item-coalblack.html|title=Bottle Green &amp; Coal Black | publisher=Nailsea &amp; District Local History Society | accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the glass works has been covered by a [[Tesco]] supermarket car park, leaving it relatively accessible for future [[Archaeology|archaeological digs]]. Other parts of the site have been cleared and filled with sand to ensure that the remains of the old glass works are preserved.

The 15th-century [[Nailsea Court]], southwest of the town, is a Grade I [[listed building]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IoE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=33712|title=Nailsea Court|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
Nailsea was part of [[Long Ashton Rural District]] from 1894 to 1974.&lt;ref name=longashtonrd&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Ashton RD|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10107763|work=A vision of Britain Through Time|publisher=University of Portsmouth|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now within the [[North Somerset]] [[unitary authority]], which covers part of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Somerset]] but it is administered independently of the [[non-metropolitan county]]. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in [[Weston-super-Mare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Town Hall|url=http://www.n-somerset.gov.uk/Your+Council/The+Council/Locations/townhall.htm|publisher=North Somerset Council|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]] exist in ''Nailsea''. Their area and population are the same as described above.

It is in the [[North Somerset (UK Parliament constituency)|North Somerset]] [[constituency]] represented in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100221151902/http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/North_Somerset.shtml |title=Final recommendations for parliamentary constituencies in the unitary authority of North Somerset |publisher=[[Boundary Commission for England]]|date=8 November 2000 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election. Since the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election of 2010]] the constituency has been represented by [[Liam Fox]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/election2010/results/constituency/d24.stm |title= Somerset North |work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nailsea is also part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England]] [[constituency]] of the [[European Parliament]], which elects six [[Members of the European Parliament|MEPs]] using the [[d'Hondt method]] of [[party-list proportional representation]].

==Geography==
[[File:Greater bristol small.png|thumb|right|Nailsea and [[Greater Bristol]]]]
The [[Land Yeo]] river flows to the east of the town. The [[North Somerset Levels]] to the west have been drained and farmed by generations of farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/wildlife/project_nslm.htm |title=North Somerset Levels and Moors Project|work=North Somerset Levels and Moors Project|publisher=Avon Wildlife Trust|accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors SSSI]] is a 129.4 [[hectare]] [[biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]]. The soils in the area include clays of the Allerton and Wentloog Series&lt;ref name=&quot;sssisheettnkm&quot;/&gt; and peat soils of the Sedgemoor and Godney Series,&lt;ref name=&quot;sssisheettnkm&quot;/&gt; which are drained by a network of large rhynes and smaller field ditches, which support exceptionally rich plant and invertebrate fauna communities. Exceptional populations of Coleoptera occur, amongst which are at least 12&amp;nbsp;nationally scarce species and 2&amp;nbsp;nationally rare species, including Britain’s largest water beetle the [[great silver water beetle]] (''Hydrophilus piceus'').&lt;ref name=&quot;sssisheettnkm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000021.pdf |title=SSSI citation for Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors SSSI| publisher= English Nature | accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several other [[Nature Reserves in Nailsea|local nature reserves]].

The Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake [[Local Nature Reserve]], southeast of the town centre and close to the [[Nailsea and Backwell railway station]], was constructed as a [[balancing lake|balancing pond]] in the mid-1970s, and has since become home to various wildfowl and dragonflies and a foraging area for bats. Bird species seen on the reserve include [[gadwall]], [[shoveller]], [[common pochard|pochard]], [[tufted duck]], [[grey heron]] and [[mute swan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake|url=http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?themeid=1008788|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearby towns and villages include [[Backwell]], [[Wraxall, Somerset|Wraxall]], [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], [[Clevedon]], and [[Tickenham]]. Nailsea is {{convert|8|mi}} from the centre of [[Bristol]], and close to the tourist centres of [[Weston super Mare]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. It is {{convert|8.5|mi|km|0}} by road from the port and service area at [[Avonmouth]].

===Climate===

In common with the rest of [[South West England]], Nailsea has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=South West England: climate | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual mean temperature is approximately {{convert|10|°C}}. [[Temperateness|Seasonal temperature variation]] is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima of approximately {{convert|21|°C}}. In winter mean minimum temperatures of {{convert|1|°C}} or {{convert|2|°C}} are common.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt; In summer the [[Azores]] high pressure affects the south-west of England, although [[convective]] cloud sometimes forms inland and reduces the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt; In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by [[Low-pressure area|Atlantic depressions]] or by [[convection]]. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by the Sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around {{convert|700|mm|abbr=on}}. About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Nailsea-highstreet.JPG|thumb|Nailsea High Street]]
Primary income often comes from employment in the [[service sector]], including industries such as insurance and banking, defence related employment, retail and management.&lt;ref&gt;National Statistics: [http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do;?a=2&amp;b=5940320&amp;c=BS48+1TB&amp;d=14&amp;e=9&amp;g=399899&amp;i=1x1003x1004&amp;o=1&amp;m=0&amp;enc=1&amp;dsFamilyId=27 Nailsea East], [http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/diss emination/LeadTableView.do;?a=2&amp;b=5940319&amp;c=nailsea&amp;d=14&amp;e=9&amp;g=399910&amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;m=0&amp;enc=1&amp;dsFamilyId=27 Nailsea North and West]&lt;/ref&gt; Employment within Nailsea includes work in shops, schools, estate agents and banks. Larger businesses in Nailsea include [[GE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nailsea facility|url=http://www.geoilandgas.com/businesses/ge_oilandgas/en/literature/en/downloads/nailsea_facility.pdf|publisher=GE Oil and Gas|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bristol Wessex Billing Services Ltd., the billing company jointly owned by [[Bristol Water]] and [[Wessex Water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|url=http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/contact.asp|publisher=Bristol Water|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other businesses are situated at units in the town. Nailsea has three large industrial and business estates located at Southfield road, Blackfriars road and Coates Estate (former site of the local cider making industry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrwproperties.co.uk|title=Coates Estate, Nailsea | publisher=JRW Properties Ltd | accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nailsea's shopping area includes Somerset Square, Crown Glass Place, Colliers Walk, and a [[high street]]. There are four[[supermarket]] chains in the town (Tesco, Waitrose, Co-Op and Iceland) and some national banks and [[estate agent]]s.

Coate's cider factory in Nailsea was first opened in 1788 and was bought by Showerings of Shepton Mallet in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Village Story&amp;nbsp;— Coates Cider|url=http://www.abbotsleigh.org.uk/ALCider.html|work=Abbotsleigh|accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand was subsequently merged with Gaymers and absorbed by Matthew Clark Brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haley |first=Ned |title=Wordsworth Dictionary of Drink|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5X6oVI-qngwC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=coates+cider+nailsea#PPA151,M1 |year=2005 |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |isbn=1-84022-302-2 |page=151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Coates, there was Heath Brewery, owned by the Thatcher family, which was situated behind the former Friendship Inn. The site of the old factory is now called 'Coates Estate' and is home to a diverse range of both local and national businesses.

==Culture and community==
Nailsea has several pubs and used to have a small nightclub called Decades, formerly known as the AJ's Bar. There are dedicated youth clubs and two [[The Scout Association|Scouting divisions]], which organise the Nailsea Carnival and Mayfair respectively. Nailsea has theatre, musical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nailseamusicals.org.uk/|title=Nailsea Musicals}}&lt;/ref&gt; and orchestral groups.

There are three children's play parks and smaller areas of green land in the town's housing estates. The Scotch Horn Park contains a [[skate park]] and children's play park. There are no cinemas in Nailsea, but [[Curzon Community Cinema, Clevedon|The Curzon]] in nearby [[Clevedon]] has been operating since 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curzon Cimena|url=http://www.curzon.org.uk/|publisher=Curzon Cinema|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjacent village of Wraxall has a couple of tourist attractions. [[Noah's Ark Zoo Farm]] has displays of exotic, agricultural and domestic animals including [[rhinoceros]], [[camel]]s, [[monkey]]s, [[reptile]]s and most recently a [[giraffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noah's Ark Zoo Farm|url=http://www.noahsarkzoofarm.co.uk/pages/visiting/attractions/animals.php|publisher=Noah's Ark Zoo Farm|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers hands-on experience with animals and a chance to learn about [[Habitat conservation|conservation]]. [[Tyntesfield]], a 19th-century Victorian country house and grounds, was bought and opened up by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;bombsandbears&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/aug/05/heritage|title=Bombs, bears and a carved coconut: inside a neo-Gothic treasure trove|last=Siddique|first=Haroon|date=5 August 2008|work=The Guardian|page=8|accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An edition of the [[North Somerset Times]] is published as the Nailsea Times.

Nailsea has a popular carnival annually which has been held since the 1960s, in which all of the local schools and Scouts participate. It also holds a very popular beer &amp; cider festival also held annually at Nailsea and Backwell Rugby Football Club which started in 2004.

==Transport==
[[File:Nailsea and Backwell railway station MMB 56.jpg|thumb|[[Nailsea and Backwell railway station]]]]
