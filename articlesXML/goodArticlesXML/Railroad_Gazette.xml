[[File:Railroad Gazette cover 1904.png|thumb|The cover of ''Railroad Gazette'', June 17, 1904 to December 31, 1904]]

'''''Railroad Gazette''''' was a [[trade journal]] first published in April 1856 that focused on railroad, transportation and engineering topics. Master [[mechanic]]s read and used the publication to share information about railway matters with one-another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisk&quot;/&gt; An article in the publication documented what was purported to be the first locomotive run in the United States on a railroad, which was stated as performed by the author of the article. It also reported about the Erie Railroad's Rochester Division's electrification and about the opening of the Thebes Bridge. ''Railroad Gazette'' editors included [[Arthur M. Wellington|Arthur Mellen Wellington]] and [[Matthias N. Forney|Matthias Nace Forney]], and [[Horace Cleveland]] was an article contributor.

Another publication of the same name ''Railroad Gazette'' was established in 1843 in Rogersville, Tennessee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foster&quot;/&gt; It focused exclusively upon &quot;internal improvement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foster&quot;/&gt;

==Overview==
'''''Railroad Gazette''''' was a [[trade journal]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Camp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RG2&quot;/&gt; published in the United States that focused on railroad news, transportation and engineering.&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldCat2&quot;/&gt; The journal also published [[editorial]] content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trachtenberg 1979 p. 111&quot;/&gt; It was established and first published in April 1856.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG1&quot;/&gt; Master train [[mechanic]]s were among the journal's readership, who used it to share in technological information about railway matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisk&quot;/&gt; The publication served as a forum for readers to discuss railroad management and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt;

==Content==
In February–June 1872, ''Railroad Gazette'' published a series of articles written by a person using the pen name &quot;Hindoo&quot;, and reader comments in response to the articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; Hindoo was a British colonial official who was visiting the United States, who stated that the Indian railway system very rarely had problems with head-on and rear-end collisions, which were more frequent in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; Hindoo proposed that this was due to the manner in which Indian train stations [[dispatching|dispatched]] trains using [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]]s, in which a system was used whereby each train station acted as a &quot;blocking point.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; This blocking point system was originally devised by the British railroad industry, and forbade trains from leaving a station until a telegraph was received from the next station stating that the line was clear, upon which a clearance card was issued to the train operator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; Hindoo felt that the U.S. system placed too much responsibility upon a single dispatcher, who would &quot;oversee all freight and passenger train movements on a division.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; 

Hindoo's articles provided a comparison of safety matters between Indian and American railway systems, comparisons of management systems and styles and comparisons in train dispatching methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; A main contributor to the ongoing discussion was a reader using the pen name &quot;X&quot;, and several other readers also responded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; In a response, X stated that the U.S. system was less expensive and more efficient compared to British and Indian methods, and posited whether another system could be used that is both cost effective and safe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; Additional reader responses generally concurred with X's opinion, but did not provide solid suggestions about how to remedy such problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; One respondent stated that some of the comparisons were faulty as being based upon U.S. railway lines that did not use telegraphic dispatching.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt; This discourse in ''Railroad Gazette'' during this time also covered various aspects of problems and flaws in the American railroad system, and potential reforms to remedy these problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwantes 2008&quot;/&gt;

An article published on April 18, 1884 in ''Railroad Gazette'', written by [[railroad engineer]] [[Horatio Allen]] and titled &quot;The First Railroad in America&quot;, states that the author (Allen) was the operator of the first locomotive run in the United States on a railroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;/&gt; Allen stated that on August 9, 1829, he ran a locomotive named ''[[Stourbridge Lion]]'' in Pennsylvania &quot;three miles and back over rails of wood upon which bar iron 2 ¼ inches wide and 1 ½ inch thick was spiked down&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen&quot;/&gt;

''Railroad Gazette'' reported about the [[electrification]] of the [[Erie Railroad]]'s Rochester Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Diamond&quot;/&gt; It also reported about the [[Thebes Bridge]] at the time the bridge was opened in Illinois.&lt;ref name=&quot;seMissourian.com 2015&quot;/&gt;

==Personnel==
[[Arthur M. Wellington|Arthur Mellen Wellington]] was one of the editors of ''Railroad Gazette'' from 1884 to early 1887.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petroski&quot;/&gt; Wellington's work ''The Economic Theory of the Location of Railroads'' was first published in a series of ''Railroad Gazette'' articles in 1876.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petroski&quot;/&gt; A book of the same content was published in 1877 by ''Railroad Gazette''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petroski&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellington&quot;/&gt; [[Matthias N. Forney|Matthias Nace Forney]] was editor of the publication in the (circa) 1870s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puffert&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;White 1985&quot;/&gt; In 1866, Forney patented a concept for urban [[elevated railway]]s which &quot;later became the de facto standard for elevated railway service&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cudahy 2002 p. 114&quot;/&gt; Articles written by the noted American [[landscape architect]] [[Horace Cleveland]] that focused upon tree planting efforts in the western United States were published in ''Railroad Gazette''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleveland History 1873&quot;/&gt;
