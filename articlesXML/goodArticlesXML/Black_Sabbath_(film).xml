'''''Black Sabbath''''' ({{lang-it|I tre volti della paura|lit=The Three Faces of Fear}}) is a 1963 [[horror film]] directed by [[Mario Bava]]. The film is centered on three separate tales that have an introduction and conclusion from [[Boris Karloff]]. The film stars an international cast in three short stories. The first, titled &quot;The Telephone&quot;, involves Suzy ([[Michèle Mercier]]) who continually receives threatening telephone calls from an unseen stalker. The second is &quot;The Wurdulak&quot;, where a man named Gorca (Karloff) returns to his family after claiming to have slain a Wurdulak, an undead creature who attacks those that it had once loved. The third story, &quot;The Drop of Water&quot;, features Jacqueline Pierreux as Helen Corey who steals a ring from a corpse that is being prepared for burial and finds herself haunted by the ring's original owner after arriving home.

''Black Sabbath'' follows the 1960s trend of Italian film productions, being a low budget horror anthology film with an international cast. The film is credited to various authors but is predominantly based on several uncredited sources. Several changes were made to the script even after the film had gone into production. [[American International Pictures]] suggested changes to Mario Bava during filming to make the film acceptable for the American target audience. The company created their own English language dub of the film that removed scenes involving violence and re-edited certain scenes. This version greatly changed the plot of &quot;The Telephone&quot;, giving it a supernatural story element and removing any reference to lesbianism or prostitution.

A follow-up to ''Black Sabbath'' titled ''Scarlet Friday'' was originally going to be directed by Bava and star Boris Karloff. This project was never developed. Plans for a remake were announced in 2004 with [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] attached to write the script. ''Black Sabbath'' has received favorable reviews from critics. In the early 2010s, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors, and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. ''Black Sabbath'' placed at number 73.

== Plot ==
:''Note: This plot summary refers to the original Italian version of the film''

=== &quot;The Telephone&quot; ===
Rosy ([[Michèle Mercier]]), a French call-girl, returns to her basement apartment at night. She receives a series of strange phone calls. The caller eventually identifies himself as Frank, her former pimp who has recently escaped from prison. Rosy is terrified; it was her testimony that sent Frank to prison. Rosy phones Mary ([[Lydia Alfonsi]]) for solace. The women have been estranged, but Rosy is certain that only Mary can help her. Mary agrees to come over that night. Seconds later, Frank calls again, promising that no matter what Rosy does he will have his revenge. Rosy doesn't realize that Mary is impersonating Frank on the telephone. Mary arrives at Rosy's apartment and attempts to calm Rosy's nerves.  Mary provides Rosy with a large knife for protection before she goes to sleep.

As Rosy sleeps, Mary writes a confession explaining that she made the calls to force a reunion, knowing that Rosy would call on her for help. While she is writing, an intruder enters the apartment. The intruder is Frank, who strangles Mary. The sound of their struggle awakens Rosy, and Frank realizes he murdered the wrong woman. Frank approaches Rosy's bed, but she seizes her knife and stabs Frank. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria.

=== &quot;The Wurdalak&quot; ===
In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe ([[Mark Damon]]) is a young nobleman who finds a beheaded corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio ([[Glauco Onorato]]) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, who has not been seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him to the rest of the family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka ([[Susy Andersen]]). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the [[Wurdulac|wurdalak]], a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca ([[Boris Karloff]]) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.

That same night, their child appears outside and begs to be invited in. Giorgio is stabbed by his wife while she attempts to let in her son. On opening the door, she is greeted by Gorca who bites her. Vladimir and Sdenka flee from their home and hide in the ruins of a cathedral. As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka walks outside and finds Gorca and his family surrounding her. Vladimir awakens and searches for Sdenka, finding her lying motionless in her bed at home. Sdenka awakens and upon receiving Vladimir's embrace, she bites into his neck.

=== &quot;The Drop of Water&quot; ===
In 1910s, London, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) is called to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a sapphire ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over a glass of water which drips on the floor; she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her, and the lights in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed. It rises and floats toward her. Chester begs for forgiveness, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor announces this observation, the concierge appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.

===Development===
In 1958, [[American International Pictures]] founders [[James H. Nicholson]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to look for Italian commercial films for them after the large success of the Italian feature ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958).&lt;ref name=&quot;bs-arrow-15&quot;&gt;{{Cite AV media notes

===Pre-production===
American International Pictures secured the rights to have American actors [[Mark Damon]] and [[Boris Karloff]] while the French co-production company Societé Cinématographique Lyre secured [[Michele Mercier]] and Jacqueline Pierreux (the latter is credited under the pseudonym Jacqueline Soussard).&lt;ref name=&quot;Heffernan141&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tcm-release&quot; /&gt; Mercier had previously worked with director Mario Bava on his film ''[[The Wonders of Aladdin]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/le-meraviglie-di-aladino-v55195/cast-crew|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|title=Le Meraviglie Di Aladino (1961) - Cast &amp; Crew|accessdate=March 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421183706/http://www.allmovie.com/movie/le-meraviglie-di-aladino-v55195/cast-crew|archivedate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian production company Galatea had [[Susy Andersen]] cast while retaining [[Mario Bava]] who had directed their production of ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heffernan141&quot; /&gt;

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review of the American International Picture's edit, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' stated that &quot;The Drop of Water&quot; and &quot;The Telephone&quot; were &quot;a good deal more sophisticated than usual horror fare&quot; while &quot;The Wurdulak&quot; &quot;bears no trace of [Bava's] manner of directing&quot; and that the acting was &quot;rudimentary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morriss |first=Frank |date=Jun 11, 1964 |title=Touch of Humor in Karloff Horror |journal=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Ont. |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film a negative review, referring to the ''Black Sabbath'' as &quot;three short films botched together&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 21, 1964 |title=Black Sabbath: 3-in-1 Horror Bill Is Bowl of Gruel |journal=[[The Boston Globe]]|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' stated that &quot;the eeriest thing about the picture is its decor (especially the heavy, dusty interiors of [The Drop of Water]&quot; while noting the &quot;acting is very unstylish and made worse by dubbing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfb&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|volume=31|issue=360|pages=179–180|year=1964|title=Black Sabbath &quot;(I Tre Volti della Paura)&quot;|location=London|issn=0027-0407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review stated that Bava could &quot;do better than this with less obvious material&quot; and that he seemed &quot;determined to spell everything out with a sudden zoom shots and shock cuts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mfb&quot; /&gt;

Reviewing the English-language version of the film, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' praised the film stating that &quot;pictorially it's amazing, and even the script and dubbing are way above average.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timeout-review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/black-sabbath|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|title=Black Sabbath|accessdate=March 29, 2014|author=DP}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' compared the film to anthology horror films made by the British production company [[Amicus]] noting that &quot;If only Amicus...had taken heed they might have got some ideas as to what can be done with the format.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timeout-review&quot; /&gt;

In contemporary reviews of the Italian-language version, ''[[The Dissolve]]'' gave the film three and a half stars out of five, stating &quot;There are small twists in all three stories, but for the most part, the segments suggest where they’re headed early&quot; and that the dialogue in the film is &quot;sparse, and doesn't shy away from any exploitable elements, from scantily clad women to bloody wounds and warped-faced ghouls.
