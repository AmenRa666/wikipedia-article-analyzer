The '''Evangelical Missionary Church of Besançon''' (French: ''Église évangélique missionnaire de Besançon''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consulter les annonces du JO Association (database; search for &quot;église évangélique missionnaire&quot;, 2500) |url=http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/association/index.php?ACTION=Rechercher&amp;HI_PAGE=1&amp;HI_COMPTEUR=0&amp;original_method=get&amp;WHAT=EGLISE+EVANGELIQUE+MISSIONNAIRE&amp;JTH_ID=&amp;JAN_BD_CP=2500&amp;JRE_ID=&amp;JAN_LIEU_DECL=&amp;JTY_ID=&amp;JTY_WALDEC=&amp;JTY_SIREN=&amp;JPA_D_D=&amp;JPA_D_F=&amp;rechercher.x=29&amp;rechercher.y=6&amp;rechercher=Rechercher |publisher=[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]] |language=French |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly known as the '''Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon''' and '''The Mission''', is a [[Christianity|Christian]] movement established in [[Besançon]], France, in December&amp;nbsp;1963. In close communion with the [[Protestant Federation of France]], this church belongs to the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement and in 1969 founded the Evangelical Missionary Federation (''Fédération Évangélique Missionnaire'', or FEM) to gather the various Pentecostal churches it created. The assemblies, which developed very quickly throughout eastern and northern France, numbered well over 2,000 members.

The church was founded by Aldo Benzi, who converted to Christianity after being healed from a [[pleurisy]]. Subsequent leader René Kennel, a former [[Mennonite]] farmer who became pastor of the churches in [[Saint-Dizier]] and in [[Joinville]] after discovering Pentecostalism through an evangelical Roma mission, has directed the church since 1977. Its main beliefs (expressed in a creed of eight articles of faith) and practices are nearly identical with those of most Evangelical and Pentecostal groups, with a special focus on miraculous [[gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and [[proselytism]]. In the late 1990s the church was embroiled in many trials (often on the grounds of defamation or for financial issues), losing most of them. In 2006 a [[sex scandal]] within the church led the federation to be dissolved, and the church in Besançon became independent.

Since 1988 the church has been the subject of recurring public controversy; anti-cult associations and organizations ([[UNADFI]], [[Centre contre les manipulations mentales|CCMM]] and MILS – then [[MIVILUDES]]), former members and the vast majority of media presented it as a dangerous group, mainly because of its intensive missionary activities and healing practices. The church was eventually listed as a [[cult]] in the 1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports established by the [[French National Assembly]]. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and academic circles, however, disagreed with this assessment, considering the church to be a genuine Pentecostal group. The latter responded to criticism through a defensive strategy, which included outreach to sociologists and historians and better ties with mainstream religions, local and national institutions.

==History==
The founder, Aldo Benzi (born in 1919, now deceased), is said to have been miraculously healed of recurrent [[pleurisy]] by the Rev. De Siebenthal (a leader of religious groups in Switzerland), which led him to be baptized on 15&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comment j'ai rencontré Dieu — Aldo Benzi |url=http://www.enseignemoi.com/articles/temoignage/comment-jai-rencontre-dieu.html |publisher=Enseigne-moi |first=Aldo |last=Benzi |language=French |date=11 October 2004 |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, with Pierre Nicole he created the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon (documented in files with the Prefecture of the Doubs in 1963).&lt;ref name=&quot;Choisir&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Choisir |url=http://www.choisir.ch/IMG/pdf/Mise_en_scene_du_religieux.pdf |title=Médias et religion — Mise en scène du religieux : quelle influence ? |first=Roland J. |last=Campiche |place=Lausanne |date=July–August 2001 |language=French |format=pdf |pages=13, 14 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzi was the church's president, followed by Nicole and then by René Kennel in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;A142&quot;&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennel was born in 1925 to a [[Mennonite]] family who lived in [[Chassey-Beaupré]]. His father was a farmer and mayor of the city, and Kennel was expected to run the family farm when he was older.&lt;ref name=&quot;A703&quot;&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], pp. 703,704.&lt;/ref&gt; At age&amp;nbsp;20, Kennel developed an interest in pastoral ministry and attended theological training at the Bible Institute of [[Nogent-sur-Marne]] in 1945–46,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Séguy |year=1977 |publisher=Mouton |place=Paris |title=Les assemblées anabaptistes-mennonites de France |language=French |page=718 |isbn=2-7132-0003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; training which was later completed by studies at the European Mennonite Bible School in 1948–49.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fath1&quot;&gt;[[#Fath|Fath, 2001]], pp. 300,301.&lt;/ref&gt; While still a farmer, he became a Mennonite missionary in the Meuse, Marne and Haute-Marne departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;A143&quot;&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he discovered Pentecostalism through [[Romani people|Roma]] missions, notably the Life and Light Evangelical Roma Mission (''Mission Évangélique Tsigane &quot;Vie et Lumière&quot;'');&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; he was attracted to this form of Christianity, since it emphasized missionary zeal and legitimized his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded an evangelical group in his city, which caused conflict with his family, other religious leaders and his neighbors.&lt;ref name=&quot;A703&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A143&quot;/&gt; In the early 1960s, Kennel became pastor of the church at [[Joinville, Haute-Marne|Joinville]]; he conducted humanitarian activities on his farm, providing relief to homeless, former prisoners, drug addicts and alcoholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fath1&quot;/&gt; In 1964, he also directed the church of [[Saint-Dizier]]; three years later, he decided to give up farming to fully devote himself to religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 706.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 he was appointed treasurer of the Federation of Free Evangelical Pentecostals, and elected president seven years later. Under Kennel's leadership of the Pentecostal Church of Besançon, the church quickly opened many places of worship in Northern and Eastern France; Kennel trained pastors among his converts (including his son Étienne, who was ordained in 1981), and sent them to direct the new assemblies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fath1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 707.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Kennel legally registered the Evangelical Missionary Federation, whose purpose was to federate all the churches (then composed of over thirty pastors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Union d'Églises Missionnaires (UDEM) — History |url=http://www.eglises.org/types/udem/historique/?Langue=en |publisher=eglises.org |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2005 Pastor Étienne Kennel was accused of adultery by church members, which resulted in his expulsion in January&amp;nbsp;2006. His father (considered guilty of covering up his son's actions) refused to retire, which led many believers to leave the church and pastors to vote for the federation's dissolution;&lt;ref name=&quot;A152&quot;&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; this one was officially announced as defunct on 25&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consulter les annonces du JO Association (database; search for &quot;fédération évangélique missionnaire&quot;) |url=http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/association/index.php?ACTION=Rechercher&amp;HI_PAGE=1&amp;HI_COMPTEUR=0&amp;original_method=get&amp;WHAT=FEDERATION+EVANGELIQUE+MISSIONNAIRE&amp;JTH_ID=&amp;JAN_BD_CP=&amp;JRE_ID=&amp;JAN_LIEU_DECL=&amp;JTY_ID=&amp;JTY_WALDEC=&amp;JTY_SIREN=&amp;JPA_D_D=&amp;JPA_D_F=&amp;rechercher.x=15&amp;rechercher.y=12&amp;rechercher=Rechercher |publisher=[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]] |language=French |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 14&amp;nbsp;churches in the northwest, previously members of the FEM, are (as of 2011) gathered under the name Union of Missionary Churches (''Union d'Églises Missionnaires'', or UDEM), an association registered in Châlons-en-Champagne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Union d'Églises Missionnaires (UDEM) — Church list |url=http://www.eglises.org/types/udem/?Langue=en |publisher=eglises.org |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other places of worship are independent – including the church in Besançon, which was reregistered as an &quot;Evangelical church&quot; in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Consulter les annonces du JO Association (database) |url=http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/association/index.php?ctx=eJyLz2FIK2KIL8tjSCwuzk9miC9kUEjOLyrIL0osSdUvKUpNtVIKyS*QD0pNz8zP03crSsxLzkjVdc7PLTm8Ut8lvzSpWAmbBiWG!GQGbUNDE3NDQ3MDE0szI3MDY0MLSwsThviMzBK30pwcBiNTBgC7Zyg9&amp;page=2&amp;JRE_ID=Franche-Comt%C3%A9/Doubs |publisher=[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]] |language=French |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holy Bible.JPG|thumb|200px|right|alt=A large Bible, open |Like other Pentecostal assemblies, the Evangelical Missionary Church of Besançon considers the Bible as the Word of God and interprets it literally.]]

About his church Kennel said: &quot;We are situated at the crossroads of the Pentecostal and Mennonite movements&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Réforme&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |chapter=L'Église évangélique de Besançon  |first=Benoît |last=Hervieu-Léger |title=Sectes... entre panique et confusion |journal=Réforme |date=June 2000 |place=Paris |language=French |pages=32, 33 |issn=0223-5749}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various explanations were provided by sociologists to define the place of the religious group within Christianity: [[Danièle Hervieu-Léger]] wrote that the church was created from &quot;the meeting between a movement of evangelic sensibility inside the [[Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine|Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine]], and a French Mennonite movement from the tradition of peaceful [[Anabaptism]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;DHL&quot;&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Danièle Hervieu-Léger |first=Danièle |last=Hervieu-Léger |title=La religion en miettes ou la question des sectes |publisher=Calmann-Lévy |year=2001 |page=20 |language=French |isbn=2-7021-3192-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurent Amiotte-Suchet considered that it &quot;fits into the [[Assemblies of God]]&quot;, but also &quot;in the history of a second wave of European Pentecostalism which experienced its revival in the 1970s and 1980s&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2009]], p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. Gordon Melton]] described it, in his 2005 ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism'', as one of the &quot;newest Protestant groups&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of World Religions — Encyclopedia of Protestantism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bW3sXBjnokkC&amp;pg=PA234 |first=J.

Gordon Melton |publisher=Facts on Files |place=New York |year=2005 |pages=233, 234 |isbn=0-8160-5456-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Protestantism expert [[Sébastien Fath]] deemed the church a &quot;non Baptist&quot; group, but &quot;with some common characteristics&quot; and explained that it professed a very high degree of religious activism, embraccing conversionism, biblicism and crucicentrism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fath1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SF2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Les Évangéliques en France, entre éparpillement et visibilité |url=http://www.flte.fr/pdf/pdf192.pdf |first=Sébastien |work=Théologie évangélique |last=Fath |authorlink=Sébastien Fath |format=pdf |volume=2 |number=1 |year=2003 |publisher=Faculté Libre de Théologie Évangélique |page=31 |language=French |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Protestant Federation of France, the church displayed a &quot;classical and structured [[Pentecostalism]], with very little contact with other churches.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Protestant&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Fédération Protestante de France |title=Pour dialoguer — Fédération Protestante de France et Églises candidates à une adhésion à la FPF |url=http://www.protestants.org/fileadmin/user_upload/communication/PDF/FPF_Pour_Dialoguer.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=Protestants.org |pages=19, 20 |language=French |accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-cult association [[Centre contre les manipulations mentales]] said the church &quot;comes from the classical Pentecostal movement which emerged in France in the 1950s and which now includes various groups&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ikor|Centre Roger Ikor, 1995]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church's main beliefs are expressed in a [[creed]], initially composed of twelve articles of faith based on biblical passages and adopted by the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fath1&quot;/&gt; These beliefs are almost identical to the ones of most evangelical and Pentecostal groups,&lt;ref name=&quot;CESNUR&quot;&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Massimo Introvigne |first=Massimo |last=Introvigne |title=Religious Liberty in Western Europe |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/Washington.htm |publisher=[[Center for Studies on New Religions]] |location=Washington |date=1 December 1997 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Bible|biblical]] authority viewed as the Word of God, literal biblical interpretation and the [[Trinity]], with a special focus on miraculous [[gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and [[proselytism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fath1&quot;/&gt; Later, the number of articles of faith were reduced to eight points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ce que nous croyons |url=http://www.eglise-besancon.org/nous_croyons.html |publisher=Église évangélique missionnaire de Besançon |language=French |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Amiotte-Suchet noted that they were reworded in 1998 to become less explicit concerning issues which were the subject of public controversies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], pp. 759,760.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the pastors' sermons show an evolution linked to a generation gap; René Kennel continues to advocate healthy living, illustrating his speeches with stories of curses resulting from a non-Christian lifestyle, while his son placed more emphasis on &quot;the discernment of spiritual gifts and the depth of faith&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; On its website the church defines itself as apolitical; it respects current principles of [[secularism]] and freedom of conscience, does not discourage medical treatment, encourages believers to participate in social life and does not claim exclusive [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Principes de déontologie |url=http://www.eglise-besancon.org/principes_deontologie.html |publisher=Église évangélique missionnaire de Besançon |language=French |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has six weekly services, one of them located in the Rue Battant especially for people with disabilities. Each meeting is devoted to a particular Christian practice: evangelization, prayer, Bible reading, singing, and weekly worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;A150&quot;&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Horaires des réunions |url=http://www.eglise-besancon.org/horaires.html |publisher=Église évangélique missionnaire de Besançon |language=French |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings are composed of biblical sermons and studies, testimonies of religious experiences, hymns, meditation, worship, and prayers. Services are dynamic, charismatic and emotional, often evolving into ecstasy and trance; [[glossolalia]] results when the pastor calls the Holy Spirit to come upon the congregation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2009]], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and usually lasts 30 to 60 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willaime&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=&quot;La pluie de l'Esprit&quot; — Étude sociologique d'une assemblée pentecôtiste mulhousienne : &quot;Mission du Plein Évangile.

Pastors established a record of public testimonies of every baptized member.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennel's life is known by the faithful, and has an important place in the church. The pastor's break with his former religious affiliation, and his determined foundation of a new group despite many obstacles, are said to be directed by God's will; therefore, Kennel's spiritual course (which mixes &quot;extraordinary and intransigence&quot;) is presented as an example to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2009]], pp. 99–101.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Amiotte-Suchet, all testimonies (whose purpose is to strengthen the converts' faith) generally have a common thread; the former lifestyle of the faithful is almost always presented as &quot;a story of an aimless wandering, covered with failures, disappointments and misfortunes&quot; until God decides to manifest himself in the life of the future member. The future convert then demands a sign of God's reality, requires a variable length of time to strength his faith and experience the Holy Spirit, then engages fully in the church.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], pp. 265,266,273,276.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion is always said to lead to a healthier lifestyle and provide an expanded network of friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], pp. 333,334.&lt;/ref&gt;

All members actively participate in evangelization, both personally (family, friends and professional associates) and with the church ([[door-to-door]], proselytism under the big tent and on public squares, &quot;mission weeks&quot; which follow a tightly planned program).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], pp. 151,761.&lt;/ref&gt; The church has denied practising proselytism among Christian people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Réforme&quot;/&gt; However, after criticism of its methods the church became more discreet and avoided insisting publicly on miraculous healings, although it continued to highlight evangelization.&lt;ref name=&quot;A148&quot;&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it decided to stop proselytizing in hospitals, to discontinue loudspeakers in the streets, and to reduce the frequency of evangelization under the &quot;big top&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church features religious instruction for various ages, leads a choir and football team and celebrates the Holy Thursday [[Last Supper]], believers' marriages and funerals. Baptism is practiced by immersion with the pastor's approval,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; and is reserved for people aged over 15&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte, 2006]], p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fasting]] on two Sundays a month and between eight and ten conventions per year for each church are also scheduled.&lt;ref name=&quot;A150&quot;/&gt; The church participates in social and humanitarian activities and organizes recreational days, including activities such as theater, library, trips, a clothing exchange and a paint shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;A151&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Autres activités |url=http://www.eglise-besancon.org/autres_activites.html |publisher=Église évangélique missionnaire de Besançon |language=French |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fath|Fath, 2001]], p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and finances==
[[File:Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=Wooden three-story chalet on stilts, with a white sign on the top floor reading &quot;Église évangélique&quot;|Church headquarters at 4 Rue Larmet, Besançon]]
The church headquarters in Besançon were first located in the Rue Battant, then in the Rue de Belfort, and eventually moved in 1994 to 4 Rue Larmet, in a building costing about four million francs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], pp. 711,712.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the federation associated with SOS&amp;nbsp;Hope (''SOS Espérance'', established in Vesoul to assist suffering people), an evangelical musical group, Flambo, and La Bergerie in Besançon for property management.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rapport2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes - ''Les sectes et l'argent'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dossiers/sectes/r1687anx.asp |publisher=Assemblée Nationale |language=French |year=1999 |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church owns a printing house that publishes writings for worship and evangelization, including a quarterly newsletter, ''The Concierge's Ear'' (''&quot;L'Oreille du concierge&quot;'') which has been published since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;A151&quot;&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 René Kennel was the president, Daniel Gloeckler vice-president and church spokesman, Étienne Kennel secretary and R. Cuenot the treasurer of the federation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Réforme&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A147&quot;&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, a one-week course is organized in one of the churches belonging to the Evangelical Missionary Federation; named &quot;Blessing School&quot; (&quot;École de la bénédiction&quot;), this intensive Bible training consists of prayers, religious teachings and history, singing lessons, film screenings and debates.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its organizational structure the church is similar to [[Congregational church|congregationalism]], as the local assembly is autonomous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fath1&quot;/&gt; This form of congregationalism, however, is unique; the centralized organization gives to the Church of Besançon the role of head church, and the other assemblies of the federation are considered annex churches. Thus, Amiotte-Suchet opines that &quot;the unifying spirit is much more coercive than the one in other Protestant groups&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;A148&quot;/&gt; Decisions of the federation are made by all church pastors at monthly pastoral meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;A147&quot;/&gt; In the Church of Besançon, the leadership team attending the &quot;brothers' meeting&quot; is composed of René and Étienne Kennel, six appointed elders and men who have been members for a certain length of time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has been criticized for its wealth, as monthly or quarterly donations were encouraged in the second article of the statutes of the Federation of Evangelical Missionary. According to the CCMM, property acquisition was evidence of significant income.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ikor|Centre Roger Ikor, 1995]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 parliamentary report considered the church a &quot;small cult&quot; (a cult whose annual income is less than five million francs) which provided &quot;relatively accurate information&quot; to the Parliamentary Commission. The annual budget of the church was estimated between 2.4 and 3.1&amp;nbsp;million francs (the total of donations in 1998 and 1995 respectively), mainly from Sunday offerings, donations, loans, financial products and property income. In 1999, the commission estimated the church's property at about 15&amp;nbsp;million francs. As of 31&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1998, the church's net active wealth (composed of real estate and stock) reached 7.3&amp;nbsp;million francs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rapport2&quot;/&gt; Concerning its finances, the church said it applies five major principles: economy, recovery, devotion, voluntary work and solidarity. Money comes from Sunday collections, sometimes from personal loans and from donations intended for a particular use; there is no external financial support. Accounts are published at the annual general assembly of the church, by the financial commission of the Federation and by [[Social Security in France|Social Security]]. Trainee pastors work outside the church; permanent pastors receive a low salary, and are affiliated with the ''Caisse d'assurance vieillesse, invalidité et maladie des cultes'' (CAVIMAC).&lt;ref name=&quot;CESNUR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gestion de l'église |url=http://www.eglise-besancon.org/gestion_eglise.html |publisher=Église évangélique missionnaire de Besançon |language=French |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1977 and 1988, the Church of Besançon enjoyed significant growth,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 715.&lt;/ref&gt; and

==Court cases==
The ''Direction générale des impôts'' contested the religious status of the church and taxed its donations, saying &quot;the association is devoted to proselytize. It has therefore not for exclusive purpose the celebration of a worship&quot;. As a result, a 600,000-franc tax-recovery notification was sent to the church on 20&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1996,&lt;ref name=&quot;F306&quot;&gt;[[#Fath|Fath, 2001]], p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; which rose to 2.6&amp;nbsp;million francs two years later (penalties included).

In 1992, the CCMM was sued twice by the church on the grounds of [[defamation]].

==Reception==
The French Parliamentary Commission on Cults included the church in the list of [[cult]]s of the [[List of groups referred to as cults in government documents|1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports]], based on reports by the ''[[Direction centrale des renseignements généraux]]'' which labelled the church as an &quot;evangelical&quot; and &quot;healer&quot; movement.

Several anti-cult groups also considered the church a cult. The local branch of the ''Centre contre les manipulations mentales'' (CCMM, or ''Centre Roger Ikor'') directed an intense campaign against the group with repeated warnings in the media, and the President of the ''[[Union nationale des associations de défense des familles et de l'individu]]'' (UNADFI), [[Catherine Picard]], said on television that she considered the church a cult.&lt;ref name=&quot;CICNS1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Courrier à  France 2 et Jean-Luc Delarue |url=http://www.sectes-infos.net/Courriers_france2_1.htm |author=L'équipe du CICNS |publisher=[[:fr:CICNS|Centre d'Information et de Conseil des Nouvelles Spiritualités]] |language=French |date=1 June 2005 |quote=Plus tard nous aurons confirmation de Catherine Picard présidente de l'UNADFI : c'est une secte.

In response to writer in the Protestant journal ''Réforme'' Benoît Hervieu-Léger, who contended that a sole case in Besançon would have been sufficient to criticize the whole federation, the delegate also stated that complaints did not come exclusively from the church of Besançon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Réforme&quot;/&gt; The association also noted many similarities with another Pentecostal church it considered a cult, the [[Mission of Full Gospel - Christian Open Door]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Willaime&quot;/&gt; As of 2010, MIVILUDES continued to monitor the Church of Besançon because of its hold over the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A la Une – Anges ou démons — Évangéliques et islamistes prospèrent sur le recul de l'État et des courants traditionnels |url=http://www.lenouveleconomiste.fr/anges-ou-demons-0097-6581/ |journal=[[:fr:Le Nouvel Économiste|Le Nouvel Économiste]] |first=Franck |last=Bouaziz |date=24 November 2010 |language=French |accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media were generally critical of the church, presenting it as a cult. The first negative local press articles appeared in 1988, mentioning miraculous healings, proselytism, Kennel's status, fundamentalist beliefs as controversial issues, and included critical reports by former members. Fath noted that the vocabulary and arguments used in the media were intentionally slanted and the repetition of those developed by the CCMM,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fath|Fath, 2001]], pp. 302–04.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the disproportionate media coverage of the church did not facilitate an objective investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fath2&quot;/&gt; According to a study by an expert in new religious movements, [[Massimo Introvigne]], when a former member destroyed furniture belonging to the church in [[Langres]] in July&amp;nbsp;1994, anti-cult associations and some news media took the former member's side, presenting him as the &quot;victim&quot; of a &quot;cult&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CESNUR&quot;/&gt; On the French talk show ''Ça se discute'' (broadcast on 25&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;2005 on [[France 2]]), a father (whose nine-year-old daughter was a member of the church with her mother) said his daughter was brainwashed; he criticized her proselytism at school, closed-mindedness and the role of women in the church. He explained that when he had suffered from cancer two years earlier, she had tried to miraculously heal him; however, she considered him a liar and a sinner because of his homosexuality. He said he found her diary, in which she spoke of her imminent death when she would reach heaven to meet her grandparents. The association for the defense of religious freedom and conscience, [[:fr:CICNS|CICNS]], criticized the talk show for its lack of alternative viewpoints.&lt;ref name=&quot;CICNS1&quot;/&gt;

Before 1988, the church was the subject of many neutral press articles and appeared &quot;normal and respectable&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Pauline |last=Côté |chapter=The media and socio-cultural regulation of religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rXrWVEHwosC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=evangelical+pentecostal+church+of+besan%C3%A7on#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Chercheurs de dieux dans l'espace public |pages=87, 88 |year=2001 |accessdate=24 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it contends that in the late 1980s [[Alain Vivien]], then-leader of the CCMM, said to its representatives in Épernay that he did not consider it a cult. The church explained that the first criticism came from a Catholic vice-president of CCMM, who opposed the conversion to the Pentecostal church of his son-in-law and several seminarians&lt;ref name=&quot;CESNUR&quot;/&gt; (this explanation was later denied by the CCMM),&lt;ref name=&quot;Réforme&quot;/&gt; by an educator hostile to the group,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fath|Fath, 2001]], p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; and by other evangelicals (including pastor and co-founder of the anti-cult group ''Vigi-sectes'' [[Gérard Dagon]], a source for the 1995 parliamentary report who was critical of Pentecostal beliefs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Réforme&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Un évangélique analyse les critères officiels retenus pour désigner les sectes à l'occasion des 10 ans du premier rapport parlementaire |url=http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/spip.php?article958 |publisher=[[Centre contre les manipulations mentales]] |year=2006 |language=French |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church also reported discriminations after the publication of the report (including refusals of [[building permit]]s) and to have spent, over a period of ten years, €82,000 in legal fees to defend its interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disc&quot;/&gt; In 2003, the church participated in a survey led by CESNUR about a possible change in government policy towards new religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Régis |last=Deriquebourg |title=La politique envers les sectes en France après la chute du gouvernement socialiste |url=http://www.sectes-infos.net/Vilnius.htm |publisher=[[Center for Studies on New Religions]] |location=Vilnius |date=April 2003 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of the parliamentary report the church reacted by seeking help from academics and sociologists specializing in religious issues, including [[Jean Baubérot]], [[Jean Séguy]], [[Jean-Paul Willaime]], Massimo Introvigne, Laurent Amiotte-Suchet, [[Bernard Blandre]] and [[Émile Poulat]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fath|Fath, 2001]], pp. 308,309.&lt;/ref&gt; who generally criticized its cult classification. Willaime and Poulat, among other sociologists, deemed the church's danger was never proven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choisir&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Pierre |last1=Bréchon |first2=Jean-Paul |last2=Willaime |authorlink2=Jean-Paul Willaime |title=Médias et religions en miroir |publisher=Presses Universitaires de France |year=2000 |page=272 |language=French |isbn=2-13-050574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danièle Hervieu-Léger said the classification as a cult was an &quot;absurd decision&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHL&quot;/&gt; Sébastien Fath considered the church &quot;a bit radical but overall harmless&quot;, noting that this group had never been sued, and maintained that the church was criticized because of its proselytism and its rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Laïcité (mars-juin 2001) |publisher=[[Human Rights League (France)]] |title=Evaluer sectes et fondamentalismes |date=June 2001 |first=Sébastien |last=Fath |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amiotte-Suchet deemed that the pastor's influence on the faithful was far from being as coercive as critics said.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Amiotte|Amiotte-Suchet, 2006]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Poulat said, &quot;We can debate whether it may be a 'sect' in the sense of [[Max Weber|Weber]]; it is certainly not a 'secte' [cult] in the popular and parliamentary sense of the term&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Émile |last=Poulat |authorlink=Émile Poulat |title=L'Église Évangélique de Pentecôte de Besançon — Église ou secte? |journal=Réforme |number=2733 |date=28 August 1997 |language=French |issn=0223-5749}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contacted by academics to participate in a documentary about the church, UNADFI and CCMM refused to explain their position.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fath|Fath, 2001]], p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Studies on New Religions]] said the church's theology is &quot;clearly mainline&quot;, but was criticized &quot;because it does not belong to the World Council of Churches or other establishment church bodies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |title=Religion news service |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/RNS.htm |date=6 December 1997 |publisher=MediaNews Group |place=Salt Lake City |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church established a dialogue with the [[Catholic Church]] and the Protestant Federation of France (FPF); the latter agreed to meet Daniel Gloeckler in Châlons-en-Champagne, and Étienne and René Kennel in Besançon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protestant&quot;/&gt; At first reluctant (since it did not want to serve as an &quot;umbrella&quot; against cult accusations), the FPF agreed to establish, at its meeting on 4–5&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1997, a bilateral dialogue with the church and advised it to develop ecumenical ties;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fath|Fath, 2001]], p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; it publicly deplored the cult status of the church on 22&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communiqué de la Fédération Protestante de France à l'intention des Directions d'Églises à propos de l'Église évangélique de pentecôte de Besançon |url=http://www.protestants.org/index.php?id=1318 |publisher=Protestant.org |first=Christian |last=Seytre |date=22 January 1998 |language=French |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Protestant figures and churches (including FPF president [[Jean-Arnold de Clermont]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jean-Arnold |last=de Clermont |authorlink=Jean-Arnold de Clermont |title=Aspects psychologiques et historiques — Regards des grandes religions |url=http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Pasteur_de_Clermont.pdf |publisher=[[MIVILUDES]] |format=pdf |language=French |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine]] and the [[Salvation Army]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Choisir&quot;/&gt; provided support, expressing a favorable opinion of the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;F306&quot;/&gt;

The church also established ties with local and national institutions, such as administrative courts, municipalities and tax authorities. In 1996 it asked [[Alain Gest]], a member of the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France|French Parliamentary Commission on cults]], the reason for its cult designation. In his response Gest did not provide details on the content of the work by the ''Direction centrale des renseignements généraux'' used for the report, but advised Kennel to ask the ''Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes'' for more information.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fath|Fath, 2001]], pp. 305,318,319.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;1997 the church's representatives met the president of the ''Observatoire'', prefect Antoine Guerrier de Dumast, who advised the movement to integrate the FPF to clarify the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;SF2003&quot;/&gt; The church also appealed to the [[American Center for Law &amp; Justice#Europe|European Center of Law and Justice]], a Christian-oriented organization, to protect its freedom of religion and belief before the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ECLJ Brings Another Challenge to the Sect Law in France |url=http://www.eclj.org/Releases/Read.aspx?GUID=fc3ac583-793a-4a16-8a8f-5f653e8fb2ae |publisher=[[American Center for Law &amp; Justice#Europe|European Center of Law and Justice]] |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
