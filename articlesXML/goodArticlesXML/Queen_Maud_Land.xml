The territory lies between [[20th meridian west|20° west]] and [[45th meridian east|45° east]], between the [[British Antarctic Territory]] to the west and the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]] to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rapp|first1=Ole Magnus|title=Norge utvider Dronning Maud Land helt frem til Sydpolen|journal=Aftenposten|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Norge-utvider-Dronning-Maud-Land-helt-frem-til-Sydpolen-8168779.html|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=Aftenposten|date=21 September 2015|location=Oslo, Norway|language=Norwegian|quote=…formålet med anneksjonen var å legge under seg det landet som til nå ligger herreløst og som ingen andre enn nordmenn har kartlagt og gransket.

The claim is named after [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud of Norway]] (1869–1938).

Norwegian [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]] was the first person known to have set foot in the territory, in 1930. On 14 January 1939, the territory was claimed by Norway. From 1939 until 1945, [[Nazi Germany]] claimed [[New Swabia]],&lt;ref name=admle/&gt; which consisted of part of Queen Maud Land. On 23 June 1961, Queen Maud Land became part of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]], making it a [[demilitarised zone]]. It is one of [[dependencies of Norway|two Antarctic claims]] made by Norway, the other being [[Peter I Island]]. They are administrated by the Polar Affairs Department of the [[Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police|Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security]] in [[Oslo]].

Most of the territory is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], and a tall ice wall stretches throughout its coast. In some areas further within the ice sheet, mountain ranges breach through the ice, allowing for birds to breed and the growth of a limited [[Antarctic flora|flora]]. The region is divided into the [[Princess Martha Coast]], [[Princess Astrid Coast]], [[Princess Ragnhild Coast]], [[Prince Harald Coast]] and [[Prince Olav Coast]]. The waters off the coast are called the [[King Haakon VII Sea]].

There is no permanent population, although there are 12 active [[#Research stations|research stations]] housing a maximum average of 40 scientists, the numbers fluctuating depending on the season. Six are occupied year-round, while the remainder are seasonal summer stations. The main aerodromes for intercontinental flights, corresponding with [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], are [[Troll Airfield]], near the Norwegian [[Troll (research station)|Troll]] research station, and a runway at the Russian [[Novolazarevskaya Station]].&lt;ref name=r305/&gt;

Queen Maud Land extends from the boundary with [[Coats Land]] in the west to the boundary with [[Enderby Land]] in the east, and is divided into the [[Princess Martha Coast]], [[Princess Astrid Coast]], [[Princess Ragnhild Coast]], [[Prince Harald Coast]] and [[Prince Olav Coast]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/486862/Queen-Maud-Land |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=25 April 2011 |title=Queen Maud Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory is estimated to cover around {{convert|2700000|sqkm}}.&lt;ref name=ssb/&gt; The limits of the claim, put forth in 1939, did not fix the northern and southern limits other than as '… the mainland beach in Antarctica … with the land that lies beyond this beach and the sea beyond …'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meld.-st.-32-20142015/id2415997/ White Paper No. 32 (2014–2015) 'Norwegian Interests and Policy in Antarctica']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;At the time of the claim, Norway did not validate the [[Circular sector|sector]] method of demarcating polar territory.

== History ==

===Early activity===

Queen Maud Land was the first part of Antarctica to be sighted, on 27 January 1820 by [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian von Bellingshausen]]. It was however among the last to be explored, as it required aircraft in combination with ships to undertake systematic exploration.&lt;ref name=m540&gt;Mills, 2003, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Norwegian research activities in Antarctica rested entirely on [[Whaling in Norway|whaling]] and sealing expeditions funded by ship owners, particularly by [[Christen Christensen (shipowner)|Christen Christensen]] and his son [[Lars Christensen (explorer)|Lars]]. The first two Norwegian expeditions were carried out by sealing ships in 1892–93 and 1893–94. While they were primarily sent for exploring, sealing, and whaling possibilities, they also performed scientific research.&lt;ref name=h10&gt;Heldal, 2011, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Further Norwegian expeditions were mounted into the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=h11/&gt;

The [[Antarctic Plateau]] was claimed for Norway by [[Roald Amundsen]] as the King Haakon VII Plateau when [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|his expedition]] was the first to reach [[South Pole]] on 14 December 1911. It was mapped as a circular territory comprising the plateau around the South Pole, including all the land above latitude 85°S. However, roughly the same area had been claimed by the British as the King Edward VII Plateau, which was in conflict with the Norwegian claim. Amundsen's claim has never been officially claimed by the Norwegian government.&lt;ref name=j47&gt;Joyner, 1992, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=th21&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20sOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=onepage&amp;q= |page=21 |title=Antarctica |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |first=Trevor |last=Hatherton |year=1965 |agency= The New Zealand Antarctic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarhistorie.no/hendelser/1209014135.65/tidslinjehendelse_view?geografi=1162838073.78&amp;hovedemne=&amp;underemne=&amp;hovedepoke=&amp;underepoke=&amp; |work=Norsk Polarhistorie |title=1911: |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Queen Maud Land was initially applied in January 1930 to the land between 37°E and 49°30'E discovered by [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]] and [[Finn Lützow-Holm]] during Lars Christensen's ''Norvegia'' expedition of 1929–30.&lt;ref name=m540/&gt;&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; It was named after the Norwegian queen [[Maud of Wales]], wife of the then-reigning [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]].&lt;ref name=npi/&gt; The territory was explored further during the ''Norvegia'' expedition of 1930–31.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; During this whaling season, a total of 265 whaling ships, mostly Norwegian, worked off the coast of Queen Maud Land.&lt;ref name=r304&gt;Rubin, 2008, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same season, Riiser-Larsen discovered the Prince Olav Coast, Princess Martha Coast and Princess Ragnhild Coast from the air. Captain H. Halvorsen of the whaler ''Sevilla'' discovered the Princess Astrid Coast independently at the same time. Six years later, during Christensen's expedition of 1936–37, [[Viggo Widerøe]] flew over and discovered the Prince Harald Coast.&lt;ref name=m540/&gt; Negotiations with the British government in 1938 resulted in the western border of Queen Maud Land being set at 20°W.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

Norway's claim was disputed by Germany,&lt;ref name=admle/&gt; which in 1938 dispatched the [[New Swabia#German Antarctic Expedition (1938–1939)|German Antarctic Expedition]], led by [[Alfred Ritscher]], to fly over as much of it as possible.&lt;ref name=m540/&gt;&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; The ship [[MS Schwabenland (1925)|''Schwabenland'']] reached the pack ice off Antarctica on 19 January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 2002, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; During the expedition, an area of about {{convert|350000|sqkm}} was photographed from the air by Ritscher,&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 2002, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; who dropped darts inscribed with [[swastika]]s every {{convert|26|km}}. Germany eventually attempted to claim the territory surveyed by Ritscher under the name [[New Swabia]],&lt;ref name=m540/&gt; but lost any claim to the land following its defeat in the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=admle&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.polarhistorie.no/artikler/2008/annekteringen%20av%20dronning%20maud%20land/print_artikler_view |first=Turi |last=Widerøe |work=Norsk Polarhistorie |language=Norwegian |title=Annekteringen av Dronning Maud Land |year=2008 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Although some, notably Norwegian writer Bjarne Aagaard and German geographer Ernst Herrmann, have claimed that Germany never actually occupied the territory, it is well documented that Germany issued a decree about the establishment of a German Antarctic Sector called New Swabia after the expedition's return in August 1939.&lt;ref name=admle/&gt;|group=note}}

On 14 January 1939, five days prior to the German arrival, Queen Maud Land was annexed by Norway,&lt;ref name=npi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npolar.no/no/antarktis/dronning-maud-land.html |publisher=Norwegian Polar Institute |accessdate=10 May 2011 |language=Norwegian |title=Dronning Maud Land}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a royal decree announced that the land bordering the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies]] in the west and the [[Australian Antarctic Territory|Australian Antarctic Dependency]] in the east was to be brought under Norwegian sovereignty.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; The primary bases for the annexation were the Norwegian explorations and the need to secure the Norwegian whaling industry's access to the region.&lt;ref name=npi/&gt;&lt;ref name=npo1&gt;{{cite web |title=Forutsetninger for Antarktistraktaten |url=http://www.polarhistorie.no/artikler/2009/Antarktistraktaten |work=Norsk Polarhistorie |accessdate=15 May 2011 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific operations were also a basis, with Norwegian contributions to international polar science extending back to the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=npi/&gt; Norway was in addition forced to contend with competing claims made by the United Kingdom and other countries in the years prior to the Norwegian claim, including the new threat of German claims in Queen Maud Land.&lt;ref name=npo1/&gt; The Norwegian claim was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Bouvet sector&quot;, drawing from the previously annexed [[Bouvet Island]].&lt;ref name=admle/&gt; During 1946 and 1947, vast areas of Queen Maud Land were photographed during the [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] expedition. In 1948, Norway and the United Kingdom agreed to limit Queen Maud Land to longitudes from 20°W to 45°E, and that the Bruce Coast and [[Coats Land]] were to be incorporated into Norwegian territory.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

The [[Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] of 1949–52 was the first international scientific expedition in Antarctica. The expedition established its winter quarters at a base called Maudheim at 71°S, 11°W, and mapped much of western Queen Maud Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/norway-and-antarctica/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/maudheim |publisher=[[Polar Conservation Organisation]] |title=Maudheim |date=2 December 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2011 |first=Kris |last=Molle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarhistorie.no/ekspedisjoner/Maudheim-ekspedisjonen |work=Norsk Polarhistorie |title=Maudheim-ekspedisjonen (NBSX) |language=Norwegian |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[International Geophysical Year]] (1957–1958), year-round stations were established in Queen Maud Land by Norway, the [[Soviet Union]], Belgium and Japan. The Norwegian expedition continued with topographical mapping, while the others started geophysical and geological research. Norway's Norway Station was lent to South Africa following the withdrawal of the Norwegian expedition in 1960. South Africa later built the [[SANAE]] station, near the now-defunct Norway Station. The Soviet Union, and later Russia, has maintained continual operations, although it moved from Lazarev Station to [[Novolazarevskaya Station]]. Japan has been based at its [[Showa Station (Antarctica)|Showa Station]] since 1957, except for a hiatus of a few years. Belgium closed its Roi Baudouin station in 1961, though it mounted limited operations in cooperation with the Netherlands in 1964–66. The United States established the temporary [[Plateau Station]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

In 1948, the newly created [[Norwegian Polar Institute]] was assigned the administration of Norwegian territories in the Arctic and Antarctic, including Queen Maud Land.&lt;ref name=h11&gt;Heldal, 2011, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Norway sent two major expeditions to the territory in the 1940s and 1950s, but its efforts declined after that.&lt;ref name=npi/&gt; On 21 June 1957, Queen Maud Land became subject to Norwegian [[sovereignty]] as a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] (''biland''),&lt;ref name=foranttrakt/&gt; and the [[Antarctic Treaty]] officially came into force on 23 June 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forutsetninger for Antarktistraktaten: Antarktistraktaten |url=http://www.polarhistorie.no/artikler/2009/Antarktistraktaten2 |work=Norsk Polarhistorie |accessdate=15 May 2011 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian activity during the 1960s was limited to some minor co-expeditions with the United States, until it gradually picked up again following a larger expedition to western Queen Maud Land and the eastern [[Weddell Sea]] by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1976–77.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;&lt;ref name=npi/&gt;

== Legal status ==
[[File:Dronning Maud Land in Norway.svg|thumb|upright|left|The locations of Norway (white) and Queen Maud Land (red stripes)]]

Like all other [[territorial claims in Antarctica]], the Norwegian claim of Queen Maud Land (along with its claim of [[Peter I Island]]) is subject to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. The treaty makes clear that Antarctica can only be used for peaceful purposes and assures the freedom of scientific activity. It promotes international scientific cooperation and bans any [[Nuclear power|nuclear]]-related activities. Although territorial claims are not invalidated by the treaty, all claims are effectively suspended as long as the treaty is in force.&lt;ref name=pco1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/norway-and-antarctica/norway-and-antarctica |publisher=[[Polar Conservation Organisation]] |date=29 October 2010 |title=Norway and Antarctica |accessdate=22 July 2011 |first=Kris |last=Molle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npianttr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npolar.no/no/antarktis/antarktistraktaten.html |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |accessdate=18 July 2011 |language=Norwegian |title=Antarktistraktaten}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2015}} Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognised each other's claims in Antarctica.&lt;ref name=nrc&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNxjxfm4cSgC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Antarctic treaty system: an assessment |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-03640-5 |author=National Research Council (U.S.) Polar Research Board |page=370 |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian administration of Queen Maud Land is controlled by the Polar Affairs Department of the [[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice and the Police]], located in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/jd/About-the-Ministry-of-Justice-and-the-Po/Organization/Departments/The-Polar-Affairs-Department.html?id=1447 |title=Polar Affairs Department |publisher=[[Norwegian Ministry of the Environment]] |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annexation of the territory is regulated by the Dependency Act of 24 March 1933; Queen Maud Land was added on 21 June 1957. It establishes that Norwegian [[criminal law]], [[private law]] and [[procedural law]] applies to the territory, in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid in the territory. Furthermore, it establishes that all the land belongs to the state, and prohibits both nuclear detonations and the storage of nuclear waste.&lt;ref name=ld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19300227-003-0.html#1 |title=Lov om Bouvet-øya, Peter I's øy og Dronning Maud Land m.m. (bilandsloven). |work=[[Lovdata]] |accessdate=18 July 2011 |date=13 July 2011 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 5 May 1995, Norwegian law has required all Norwegian activity in Antarctica to follow international environmental law for Antarctica. Norwegian citizens who plan activities in Queen Maud Land must therefore report to the Norwegian Polar Institute, which may prohibit any non-compliant activity. Those who visit Queen Maud Land must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for [[search and rescue]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/md/tema/svalbard_og_polaromradene/antarktis.html?id=279712 |title=Antarktis |publisher=[[Norwegian Ministry of the Environment]] |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fauna and flora ==
[[File:Pétrel des neiges - Snow Petrel.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a white bird sitting on a rock.|The [[snow petrel]] is one of the species of birds found in Queen Maud Land.]]

There are three types of [[bird]]s around Troll: the [[Antarctic petrel]], the [[snow petrel]] and the only [[bird of prey|raptor]] in Queen Maud Land, the [[south polar skua]]. The Antarctic petrel lives on the [[sea ice]] for most of the year, with the exception of its breeding season (in Antarctica, from November to February), when it moves to the inland mountains and [[nunatak]]s.&lt;ref name=npi6&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.npolar.no/no/tjenester/publikasjoner/faktaark/sjofugler-antarktis.html |publisher=Norwegian Polar Institute |language=Norwegian |title=Faktaark: Sjøfuglene i Antarktis |first=Hallvard |last=Strøm |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|3.9|sqkm|sing=on}} area of ice-free cliffs in Princess Astrid Coast called [[Svarthamaren Mountain]] hosts Antarctica's largest known inland colony of breeding seabirds, almost 1 million (250,000 pairs) Antarctic petrels.&lt;ref name=npi/&gt;&lt;ref name=npi6/&gt; Many snow petrels and south polar skuas also breed in this area. Snow petrels are generally spread out in smaller colonies throughout the mountainous areas of Queen Maud Land. During the breeding season, the south polar skua feeds exclusively upon the eggs, as well as both young and adult birds, of both petrel species.&lt;ref name=npi6/&gt;

The [[emperor penguin]] has some of its breeding places concentrated in Queen Maud Land.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 2008, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; All four of the true Antarctic seals, namely the [[Weddell seal]], [[leopard seal]], [[crabeater seal]] and [[Ross seal]], can be found in the King Haakon VII Sea off Queen Maud Land.&lt;ref name=min&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miljostatus.no/Tema/Polaromradene/Antarktis/Dronning-Maud/ |publisher=[[Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency|Miljøstatus i Norge]] |title=Dronning Maud Land |date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=15 July 2011 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyner, 1992, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ross seal is notably found in its greatest numbers in the King Haakon VII Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIGvBCorXLcC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq= |page=19 |title=Seals |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |first=David |last=Stone |year=1995 |isbn=978-2-8317-0049-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nunatak areas have a scarcity of flora, limited to [[lichen]], [[bryophyte]] and [[algae]]. [[Flowering plant]]s are not found there. The Norwegian Polar Institute has not registered the occurrence of any threatened or rare plants or animals in Queen Maud Land, the known ones thus existing in healthy populations.&lt;ref name=min/&gt;

[[File:SANAE IV from above the northern buttress.jpg|thumb|left|alt2=Photograph of a base near the edge of a barren cliff, surrounded by snow|SANAE IV station]]

Queen Maud Land is currently home to 12 research stations, the Norwegian [[Troll (research station)|Troll]] and [[Tor (research station)|Tor]] stations; Russia's [[Novolazarevskaya Station]]; South Africa's [[SANAE IV]]; the Swedish [[Wasa (research station)|Wasa]]; the Finnish [[Aboa (research station)|Aboa]]; The German [[Neumayer-Station III]] and [[Kohnen]]; Indias [[Maitri]] station; the Japanese [[Showa Station (Antarctica)|Showa Station]] and [[Dome Fuji Station]]; and Belgium's [[Princess Elisabeth Base]].

These stations are connected by the Dronning Maud Land Air Network Project ([[DROMLAN]]), which is a cooperative agreement for transportation between eleven nations with research stations in East Antarctica. Long-range aircraft fly between Cape Town, South Africa and either the [[Troll Airfield]], located at the Troll research station, or the runway at the [[Novolazarevskaya Station]]. From these two main airfields, smaller aircraft may fly further to other Antarctic destinations.&lt;ref name=r305/&gt;

Norway's Troll station serves as a major hub of the DROMLAN network through the Troll Airfield.&lt;ref name=r305/&gt; Research at Troll include air and atmospheric measurements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Antarktis: Troll får nye krefter |url=http://www.nilu.no/index.cfm?ac=news&amp;folder_id=4316&amp;text_id=22872&amp;view=text |publisher=[[Norwegian Institute for Air Research]] |accessdate=4 October 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tEHjLSg0 |archivedate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; monitoring of [[greenhouse gas]]es and bird colonies, as well as [[meteorology|meteorological]] and climate research.&lt;ref name=naria/&gt; The other Norwegian station, [[Tor (research station)|Tor]], was established for researching birds at the breeding colony in [[Svarthamaren Mountain]].&lt;ref name=npi6/&gt;

Activities conducted by Russia's [[Novolazarevskaya Station]] include environmental monitoring, [[geodesy]]/mapping, [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic]] and meteorological observations, [[glaciology]], [[biology]], [[Ionosphere|ionospheric]]{{\}}auroral observations, [[limnology]], [[geology]], [[geophysics]] and [[seismology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/russia-and-the-antarctic/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/novolazarevskaya |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |title=Novolazarevskaya |accessdate=21 August 2011 |date=2 December 2010 |first=Kris |last=Molle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Holtedahlfjella Nord.jpg|thumb|right|Charnockitic rock needle, northern Holtedahlfjella, Queen Maud Land, aerial photograph in SSE direction.]]
South Africa's [[SANAE IV]] station, the successor to three former stations, was completed in 1997. Research at SANAE IV include [[Invasion biology terminology|invasion biology]]/[[ecology]], geology, [[geomorphology]] and [[atmospheric sciences]]. Its facilities include a small hospital and a two-helicopter hangar.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 2008, pp. 304–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish [[Wasa (research station)|Wasa]] station and the Finnish [[Aboa (research station)|Aboa]] station together make up the [[Nordenskiöld Base]], and cooperate in research and logistics. Research carried out includes geodesy/mapping, glaciology, human biology, meteorological observations, geology and geophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/finland-and-antarctica/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/aboa |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |title=Aboa |accessdate=21 August 2011 |first=Kris |last=Molle |date=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Neumayer-Station III]], finished in 2009, succeeded two former stations that were buried by snow and ice.&lt;ref name=r304/&gt; It conducts geophysical, meteorological and seismological research, as well as air chemistry measurements and atmospheric ozone monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/germany-and-antarctica/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/neumayer |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |title=Neumayer |accessdate=21 August 2011 |first=Kris |last=Molle |date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's other station, [[Kohnen]], was opened as part of a major ice-drilling project.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 2003, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maitri]] station succeeded the [[Dakshin Gangotri]] station in 1989, India's first Antarctic base.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 2008, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Maitri's research focus on geology, and the study of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]], when India and Antarctica belonged to the same landmass. It also includes low-temperature engineering research that is relevant to conditions in the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;McGonigal, 2009, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Showa Station (Antarctica)|Showa Station]] is Japan's main research station in Antarctica. A vast array of research is conducted there, including upper atmosphere physics, meteorology, seismology, [[gravimetry]], geodesy/mapping, [[oceanography]], glaciology, geology, marine and terrestrial biology, and medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/japan-and-antarctica/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/syowa |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |title=Syowa |accessdate=21 August 2011 |date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's other station, [[Dome Fuji Station]] was opened as part of a major ice-coring project.&lt;ref name=m540/&gt; It mainly studies climate change and conducts deep drilling and atmospheric observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/japan-and-antarctica/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/dome-fuji |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |title=Dome Fuji |accessdate=21 August 2011 |date=3 November 2010 |first=Kris |last=Molle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgium's [[Princess Elisabeth Base]] was established as a project to promote polar sciences, as well as to demonstrate the possibility of building a [[Zero emission]] station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antarcticstation.org/station/ |publisher=Princess Elisabeth Antarctica |title=Princess Elisabeth Antarctica |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is conducted by an international team of scientists, studying climatology, glaciology and [[microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-bases/belgium-and-antarctica/stations-bases-camps-and-refuges/princess-elisabeth-base |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |title=Princess Elisabeth |accessdate=21 August 2011 |date=2 November 2010 |first=Kris |last=Molle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
