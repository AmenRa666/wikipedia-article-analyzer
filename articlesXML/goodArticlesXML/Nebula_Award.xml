The '''Nebula Awards''' annually recognize the best works of [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] published in the United States during the previous year. The awards are organized and awarded by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA), a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit association]] of professional science fiction and fantasy writers. They were first given in 1966 at a ceremony created for the awards, and are given in four categories for different lengths of literary works. A fifth category for film and television episode scripts was given 1974–78 and 2000–09. The rules governing the Nebula Awards have changed several times during the awards' history, most recently in 2010.

The Nebula Awards have been termed as one of &quot;the most important of the American science fiction awards&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardianquote&quot;/&gt; Winning works have been published in special collections, and winners and nominees are often noted as such on the books' cover. SFWA numbers the awards by the year prior to the year the award is given in; the 2012 awards were presented in San Jose, California on May 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfwa.org/2013/02/2012-nebula-awards-nominees-announced/ 2012 Nebula Awards nominees announced] SFWA, November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

For lists of winners and nominees for each Nebula category, see the [[#Categories|list of categories]] below.

==Award==

The Nebula Awards are given each year by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA) for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] fiction published in the United States during the previous year. The winner receives a trophy but no cash prize; the trophy is a transparent block with an embedded glitter spiral [[nebula]] and gemstones cut to resemble planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hist&quot;/&gt; The trophy itself was designed for the first awards by J. A. Lawrence, based on a sketch by [[Kate Wilhelm]], and has remained the same ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFEneb&quot;/&gt; Works are eligible for an award if they were published in English in the prior calendar year. There are no written rules as to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy, and the decision of eligibility in that regard is left up to the nominators and voters, rather than to SFWA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hist&quot;/&gt;

Nebula Award nominees and winners are chosen by members of the SFWA, though the authors of the nominees do not need to be members. Works are nominated each year between November 15 and February 15 by published authors who are members of the organization, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, though they can decline nominations, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEBrules&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nebula Trophy.jpg|thumb|alt=Nebula Award|upright|Nebula Award for Best Novella for &quot;[[The Green Leopard Plague]],&quot; by [[Walter Jon Williams]]]]

The first Nebulas were given in 1966, for works published in 1965. The idea for such an award, funded by the sales of anthologies collecting the winning works, was proposed by SFWA secretary-treasurer [[Lloyd Biggle, Jr.]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFEneb&quot;/&gt; The idea was based on the [[Edgar Award]]s, presented by the [[Mystery Writers of America]], and hosting a ceremony to present them at was prompted by the Edgar and [[Hugo Award]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hist&quot;/&gt; The initial ceremony consisted of four literary awards, for [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Novels]], [[Nebula Award for Best Novella|Novellas]], [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette|Novelettes]], and [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story|Short Stories]], which have been presented every year since. A Script award was also presented from 1974 to 1978 under the names Best Dramatic Presentation and Best Dramatic Writing and again from 2000 through 2009 as Best Script, but after 2009 it was again removed and replaced by SFWA with the [[Ray Bradbury Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SFEneb&quot;/&gt;

Prior to 2009, the Nebula Awards employed a rolling eligibility system. Each work was eligible to qualify for the ballot for one year following its date of publication. As a consequence of rolling eligibility, there was the possibility for works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create the final ballot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Locusrules&quot;/&gt; In 1970, the option was added for voters to select &quot;no award&quot; if they felt that no nominated work was worthy of winning; this happened in 1971 in the Short Story category and in 1977 in the Script category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hist&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in 1980 the eligibility year for nominations was set to the calendar year, rather than December–November as initially conceived, and the SFWA organizing panel was allowed to add an additional work. Authors were also allowed to use the mass-market paperback publication of their books as the beginning of their nomination period, rather than the initial hardback publication. As a consequence of the combination of this rule and the rolling eligibility, the 2007 awards, despite nominally being for works published in 2006, instead were all given to works initially published in 2005. Beginning with the 2010 awards, the rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFEneb&quot;/&gt;

Beside the Nebulas, several other awards and honors are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony, though not necessarily every year. Two of them are annual literary awards voted by SFWA members on the Nebula ballot:&lt;ref name=SFWA2012/&gt; the [[Andre Norton Award|Andre Norton Award for Outstanding Young Adult Science Fiction or Fantasy Book]], inaugurated 2006, and the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation, which replaced the Best Script award in 2010.&lt;ref name=SFEneb/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFWAnorton/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LOCUSbrad&quot;/&gt; The others are the [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award]] since 1975 for &quot;lifetime achievement in science fiction and/or fantasy&quot;, the [[Author Emeritus]] since 1995 for contributions to the field, the Kevin O'Donnell, Jr. Award for service to SFWA, and the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award since 2009 for significant impact on speculative fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFEneb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFWAservice&quot;/&gt; All four are discretionary but a Grand Master, selected by the officers and past presidents, has been named every year for more than a decade.&lt;ref name=LOCUSgm/&gt; The Solstice Award may be presented posthumously (where only living writers may be named Grand Master or Author Emeritus); in all, twelve have been awarded in five years to 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFWAsolstice&quot;/&gt;

==Recognition==

The Nebula Awards have been described as one of &quot;the most important of the American science fiction awards&quot; and &quot;the science-fiction and fantasy equivalent&quot; of the [[Emmy Award]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardianquote&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TechRepquote&quot;/&gt; Along with the [[Hugo Award]], the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction, with Laura Miller of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' terming it &quot;science fiction's most prestigious award&quot;, and [[Justine Larbalestier]], in ''The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction'' (2002), referring to it and the Hugo Award as &quot;the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SALONnebula&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOTSSF&quot;/&gt; [[Brian Aldiss]], in his book ''Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction'', claimed that the Nebula Award provided &quot;more literary judgment&quot; while the Hugo was a barometer of reader popularity, rather than artistic merit, though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;TYS&quot;/&gt; [[David Langford]] and [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] stated in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' (2012) that the two awards were often given to the same works, and noted that some critics felt that the Nebula selection reflected &quot;political as much as literary ability&quot; as it did not seem to focus as much on literary talent over popularity as expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFEneb&quot;/&gt;

Several people within the publishing industry have said that winning or being nominated for a Nebula Award has effects on the author's career and the sales of that work. [[Spider Robinson]] in 1992, as quoted in ''Science Fiction Culture'' (2000), said that publishers &quot;pay careful attention&quot; to who wins a Nebula Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFC&quot;/&gt; Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his 1996 ''Mastering the Business of Writing'' that having the term Nebula Award on the cover, even as a nominee, was a &quot;powerful inducement&quot; to science fiction fans to buy a novel, and [[Gahan Wilson]], in ''First World Fantasy Awards'' (1977), claimed that noting that a book had won the Nebula Award on the cover &quot;demonstrably&quot; increased sales for that novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;MBW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FWFA&quot;/&gt;

There have been several anthologies collecting Nebula-winning short fiction. The series ''Nebula Winners'', published yearly by SFWA and edited by a variety of SFWA members and renamed as the ''Nebula Awards Showcase'' series since 1999, was started in 1966 as a collection of short story winners and nominees for that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFEanth&quot;/&gt; The sales of these anthologies were intended to pay for presenting the awards themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFEneb&quot;/&gt; The anthology ''The Best of the Nebulas'' (1989), edited by [[Ben Bova]], collected winners of Nebula awards from 1966 through 1986 officially selected by SFWA members.&lt;ref name=&quot;HWSFF&quot;/&gt; The unofficial anthology ''Nebula Award Winning Novellas'' (1994), edited by [[Martin H. Greenberg]], contained ten stories which had won the novella award between 1970 and 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFEanth&quot;/&gt;
