The '''Mezhyhirya Savior-Transfiguration Monastery'''{{#tag:ref|The monastery's inhabitants referred to the monastery as the &quot;Place of the Mezhyhorod Saviour&quot; ({{lang-uk|Обитель «Межигорского спаса»}}). See: {{cite book|title=Kiev, its sacred places and attractions|series=5th volume|work=Description of life in Russia|publisher=Nostalgiya|language=Russian|chapter=Malorossiya, Podoliya, and Volyn|chapterurl=http://www.nostalgia2.kiev.ua/history-kiev_008.shtml}}|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} ({{lang-uk|Межигірський Спасо-Преображенський монастир}}, ''Mezhyhirskyi Spaso-Preobrazhenskyi Monastyr'') was an [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] female monastery that was located in the neighborhood of Mezhyhiria.

The monastery served as a historic Princely residency of [[Rurik dynasty]] during the [[Middle Ages|Medieval times]] located just {{convert|10|km|mi}} to the north of [[Vyshhorod]]. Today, the territory is part of the [[Vyshhorod Raion]], [[Kiev Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) in northern [[Ukraine]]. The location is situated in the [[Mezhyhirya ravine]], on the right bank of the [[Dnieper River]] in close proximity to the [[Kiev Reservoir|Kiev water reservoir]].

Founded in 988 [[Anno Domini|AD]], the Mezhyhirya Monastery was one of the first monasteries established in the [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] state of [[Kievan Rus']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The whole truth about the &quot;Residence of Yanukovych&quot;|url=http://golos.in.ua/politic/2007/08/17/150716.html|work=[[UNIAN]]|publisher=Golos|date=August 17, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-27|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its existence, it was destroyed, and then restored numerous times, yet it was not spared destruction by [[Soviet Union|Soviet authorities]] in 1935. At the time of its height, the Mezhyhirya Monastery was considered a spiritual center of Rus royal [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurikid house]] and later [[Cossacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American dream.

As an important monastery of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Zaporozhian Host]], the Mezhyhirya Monastery left a rich legacy behind it. The monastery was mentioned in one of [[Taras Shevchenko]]'s poems, &quot;Chernets,&quot; written in 1847,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetyka.uazone.net/kobzar/chernec.html |title=Chernets |accessdate=2007-12-26 |year=1847 |last=Shevchenko |first=Taras |authorlink=Taras Shevchenko |work=Poetyka |language=Ukrainian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010226215533/http://poetyka.uazone.net/kobzar/chernec.html |archivedate=February 26, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the subject of a drawing by him. [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s novel, &quot;[[Taras Bulba]],&quot; published in 1835, also mentions the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svitlytsia.crimea.ua/index.php?section=article&amp;artID=4897|title=Successor of the Hetmans|accessdate=2007-12-27|date=June 28, 2007|work=Krymska Svitlytsia|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundation and early history===
The monastery is mentioned for the first time in the early 14th century, although [[Yevgeniy Bolkhovitinov]] claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Lysenko|first=Valeriy|title=Legends and treasures of the Mezhyhorod place|publisher=The Ukrainian Information Project|year=2007|url=http://1000years.uazone.net/pub/DavnKnyg.doc|format=[[Microsoft Word|Word document]]|accessdate=2007-01-05|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it had been founded by the first [[Metropolitan bishop#Orthodox|Metropolitan]] of [[Kievan Rus'|Kiev]], [[Michael of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael]], along with [[Greece|Greek]] monks arriving from [[Byzantium]] in 988 [[AD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oko.kiev.ua/Monument.jsp?monumentId=191|title=Kyievo-Mezhyhirya Monastery (did not survive) (ХІІ-ХІХ c.)|accessdate=2007-12-26|work=OKO-architectural and local interest site|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is likely spurious, since Mezhyhirya is not listed by modern authors among the monasteries of Kievan Rus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russiancity.ru/books/b55.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1154, the Prince of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] divided the territory surrounding the monastery's grounds amongst his sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;vyshgorod&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vyshgorod-museum.org.ua/index.php?go=News&amp;file=print&amp;id=5|title=Kyievo-Mezhyhirksyi Spaso-Preobrazhenskyi Monastyr|accessdate=2007-12-27|work=Government historical-cultural reserve in the city of [[Vyshhorod]]|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Andrei I Bogolyubsky]] received the lands nearest to the monastery, now the city of [[Vyshhorod]]. Not too long afterwards, he is alleged to have moved the monastery to its current location in the hills of the Dnieper, giving the monastery its name, &quot;Mezhyhirya.&quot;{{#tag:ref|In this sense, ''&quot;Mizh&quot;'' (or ''&quot;Mezh&quot;'') translates as ''&quot;between&quot;'', while ''&quot;hora&quot;'' (or ''&quot;hir&quot;'') is equivalent to ''&quot;hills&quot;'' as in ''&quot;between-the-hills&quot;''.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Bogolyubsky despised the city of Kiev, therefore moving to [[Suzdal]], in modern-day [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vyshgorod&quot;/&gt; On his trip, he took with him the &quot;[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]&quot; icon, a gift from [[Constantinople]] Patriarch [[Luke Chrysoberges]] to Dolgoruki.&lt;ref name=&quot;vyshgorod&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pokotilo|first=Olga|title=To hear the sounds of that shore|url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/162279/|work=[[Den (newspaper)|Den]]|date=May 18, 2006|accessdate=2008-01-05|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The icon is one of the most venerated [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] icons, now located in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].

With the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]]' by [[Batu Khan]] in 1237-40, the monastery is supposed to have been completely destroyed. These legends were written down much later. The monastery is known to have existed in the 14th century, though. In 1482, it was attacked by the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] under [[Meñli I Giray]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt; Reconstruction on the monastery began only 40 years later. In 1523, the monastery was transferred to the King of [[Poland]] and Grand Duke of [[Lithuania]] [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I]]. In addition, the monastery was given a full reign over its territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt; In 1555, the complex consisted of four churches, including and one cave church.

===Cossack monastery===
[[File:Mezhyhirskyi Monastery by Vesterfeld, 1650s.jpg|thumb|300px|The Mezhyhirya Monastery as drawn by Abraham van Westerveld during the 1650s.]]
[[File:Mezhyhirskyi Monastery by Shevchenko, 1843.jpg|thumb|300px|A drawing of the monastery by Ukrainian poet and artist [[Taras Shevchenko]], 1843.]]

During the 16th century, the monastery frequently lost and regained its ownership rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt; On the funds of the monastery's new [[hegumen]] Afanasiy (a [[Mentorship|protégé]] of prince [[Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski]]), the monastery's old buildings were demolished, and new ones were built in their place.&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt; In 1604, the Gate Church of [[Saint Peter|Ss. Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] was constructed, in 1609 - the Mykilska Refectory, and the Transfiguration Cathedral in 1609-1611. Under his rule, the monastery was considered as the second [[lavra]] (cave monastery) in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=&quot;vyshgorod&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|It was referred to as the &quot;Sviato-Mezhyhirska Lavra&quot; ({{lang-uk|Свято-Межигірська Лавра}}).|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}

After its reconstruction, the Mezhyhirya Monastery became a regional center of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Zaporozhian Host]], serving the host as a military monastery. In 1610, the monastery received the status of a [[stauropegic]] monastery (orthodox church autonomy), under the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. The [[Universal (act)#Cossack times|universal]] (act) of [[Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] issued on May 21, 1656 transferred the neighboring settlements of [[Vyshhorod]], Novi Petrivtsi, and Moshchany under control of the Mezhyhirya Monastery. In effect, the universal made Khmelnytsky the monastery's [[ktitor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vyshgorod&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|A ''&quot;[[ktitor]]&quot;'' is someone who provides funds for the construction and decoration of a monastery.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} After the destruction of the [[Trakhtemyrivskyi Monastery]] by a Polish [[szlachta]] army, the Mezhyhirya Monastery replaced it as the main cossack military monastery.&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt; As a military monastery, retired and elderly [[cossacks]] from the Zaporozhian Host would now come to the monastery to retire and live in until the end of their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=I.|last=Vikovan|title=What is hidden behind the walls of the presidential residence?|url=http://news.uaclub.net/25_256374.html|work=UAКлув|date=November 12, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-27|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the monastery's expenses were paid off with the help of the cossack's Sich Host.

In 1676, the area was burned down after a fire started in the wooden Transfiguration Cathedral. With the help of [[Ivan Savelov]], a monk who lived in the monastery and later became a [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow#Patriarchs of Moscow and all Russia (1589–1721)|Patriarch of Moscow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatchina3000.ru/brockhaus-and-efron-encyclopedic-dictionary/065/65524.htm|title=Mezhygorskiy Spaso-Preobrazhenskiy, men's, 1st class monastery|accessdate=2007-12-27|work=[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; the complex was reconstructed. Two years later, with the help of the cossack community, the Annunciation Church was constructed near the monastery's hospital.

In 1683, the [[Sich Rada]] voted that the ministers in the [[Zaporozhian Sich|Sich]]'s Pokrovskyi Cathedral (the main cathedral of the sich) should be only from the Mezhyhirya Monastery.&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt; In 1691, monasteries located near the Sich were placed under the Mezhyhirya Monastery's authority. Under hegumen Feodosiy at the end of the 17th century, considered as a period of prosperity,&lt;ref name=&quot;vyshgorod&quot;/&gt; the Mezhyhirya Monastery became one of the largest monastery's in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt;

At the request of [[Peter I of Russia]], the stauropegic status of the monastery was revoked; it was later reinstated in 1710.&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt; In 1717, a large fire destroyed a large portion of the monastery's buildings. The monastery's &quot;military&quot; status was reconfirmed by cossacks in 1735. In 1774, with the funds of the last [[Koshovyi Otaman]] [[Petro Kalnyshevsky]], the Ss. Peter and Paul Church was reconstructed. Ukrainian architect [[Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi]] designed some of the buildings, including the monk's residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukma.kiev.ua/ua/general/history/professors/grygoro/index.php|title=Hryhorovych-Barksyi Ivan Hryhorovych|accessdate=2007-12-27|work=[[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline and Soviet demolition ===
A period of decline began with the abolition of the [[Zaporozhian Host]] by [[Catherine II of Russia]]. In 1786 the Russian Imperial government closed the monastery and confiscated its valuable treasures. The remaining Zaporozhian Cossacks soon afterwards left [[Zaporizhia (region)|Zaporizhia]], and moved to the [[Kuban]] region. There they founded the [[Kuban Cossacks|Kuban Cossack Host]], which still exists to this day. The cossacks were able to leave with some of the monastery's manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pushkin.kubannet.ru/1/rk/index3.html|title=Section I.

In 1787, [[Catherine II of Russia]] came to [[Kiev]] (''Kyiv'') for a visit and wished to see the Mezhyhirya Monastery. She never got to see it, because the monastery mysteriously burned down the night before her arrival.&lt;ref name=&quot;oko&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Межигірський монастир. 1934.jpg|thumb|225px|The Transfiguration Cathedral seen shortly before its demolition, 1934.]]

In 1796, a [[Germany|German]] engineer found that the area had suitable clay for the making of [[faience]], and two years later, founded the Mezhyhirya Faience Factory, the first one in Ukraine, at the site of the unused monastery.&lt;ref name=&quot;vyshgorod&quot;/&gt; By 1852, the faience factory had become the largest industrial complex in Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makarov|2002|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its existence, the factory produced a variety of crockery and ornamental vases and figurines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundm.iatp.org.ua/EXHIBIT/TEA-THINGS.SHTML|title=Exhibit of items from porcelain and faience factories of Ukraine from museum collections (July 6-August 31, 2005)|accessdate=2008-01-05|work=Museum of the National Ukrainian Decorative Art|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, the faience factory was closed down after it failed to bring any profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldkyiv.org.ua/data/mezh.php?lang=ru|title=Mezhigorye - Mezhigorskiy monastyr|accessdate=2007-12-28|work=oldkyiv.org.ua|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, the Mezhyhirya Monastery was rebuilt and transformed into a women's monastery. After its reconstruction, the monastery was transferred to the authority of the Intercession of the Saints Monastery in Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice-places.com/articles/ukraine/kiev/227.htm|title=Sviato-Pokrovskyi Monastery. Second continuation|accessdate=2007-12-27|work=Nice-Places.com|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Russian Revolution, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]'s capital moved from [[Kharkiv]] to Kiev in 1934, and the city was in need of a suburban residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence.&lt;ref name=&quot;novasich&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kutsyi|last=Oleksandr|title=On the residence of Viktor Yanukovych an underground passage is being built|url=http://www.gpu-ua.info/index.php?&amp;id=175890|work=Gazeta po-ukrayinski|date=August 3, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-26|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] in April 1935 ordered the [[demolition]] of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed.&lt;ref name=&quot;novasich&quot;/&gt; During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten [[manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sovremennik.ws/2007/09/17/zagadka_biblioteki_jaroslava_mudrogo.html|title=Tale of the library of Yaroslav the Wise|accessdate=2007-12-26|last=Tsalyk|first=Stanislav|authorlink=Stanislav Tsalyk|work=Biblioteka Sovremennika|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of [[Yaroslav the Wise]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sverbyhuz|first=Volodymyr|title=Secrets of the Mezhyhirya Saviour|url=http://day.kiev.ua/65335|work=[[Den (newspaper)|Den]]|date=September 14, 2001|accessdate=2007-12-27|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pavlov|first=Mikhail|title=Life of Yaroslav|url=http://www.uatoday.net/rus/article/history/47552|work=uatoday.net|date=July 9, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-27|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cossackdom.com/doc/slutskyi_monostir.htm|title=This book is of the Mezhigorskiy monastery|accessdate=2007-12-26|last=Slutskiy|first=A.|work=cossackdom.com| language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only thing that remains now of the monastic complex is a [[water well]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yanukovych is living in a medieval monastery|url=http://www.obozrevatel.com/news/2007/8/3/183156.htm|work=Obozrevatel|date=August 3, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-27|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Soviet Union|Soviet times]], the area served as a residence for [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], who worked in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]'s government at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stakhovsky|first=Dmytro|author2=Tetyana Chornovil|title=Residence of Yanukovych|url=http://www.unian.net/ukr/news/news-207470.html|work=[[UNIAN]]|date=August 13, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-26|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, its location was concealed from the public.

==Ownership controversy==

In 2008 the Mezhyhirya residence was amid an ownership controversy between the former Ukrainian [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and the new Ukrainian [[Cabinet of Ministers|government]], led by Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]. The transfer of the 1.4&amp;nbsp;km² Mezhyhirya [[official residence]] in Novi Petrivtsi, [[Vyshhorod Raion]] ([[raion|district]]) to the &quot;Nadra Ukraine&quot; firm on July 11, 2007 by Viktor Yanukovych pulled the territory from under government ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Ukrainian law|type=Decree of the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]]|number=521-р|law=521-2007-р|name=On the transferral of property to the NAK &quot;Nadra Ukraine&quot;|date=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2007, [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] signed a ''secret'' presidential decree #148, according to the local business newspaper ''Delo'' which referred to the information of the State Directorate of Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Media: Yushchenko by a secret decree presented to Yanukovych a dacha.|url=http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/389202-smi-yushchenko-sekretnym-ukazom-podaril-yanukovichu-dachu|work=KorrespondenT|date=February 28, 2008|accessdate=2010-11-21|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document states: &quot;The government [[dacha]] on the territory of the recreational complex &quot;Pushcha-Vodytsia&quot; is presented for a use to the head of [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Kabmin]], Viktor Yanukovych.&quot; Later the document has never appeared on the website of the head of state nor in any other open source of information. A single official confirmation of it was given to the newspaper by the State Directorate of Affairs. The directorate explained that the recreational complex &quot;Pushcha-Vodytsia&quot; includes the recreational resort &quot;Pushcha-Vodytsia&quot; and the Mezhyhirya residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recreational Complex &quot;Pushcha-Vodytsia&quot; of the State Directorate of Affairs|url=http://www.dus.gov.ua/275.648.0.0.1.0.phtml|work=State Directorate of Affairs (Державне управління справами)|date=February 28, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-21|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residency that is located in the village of Novi Petrivtsi was occupied by Yanukovych in the last several years.

The newspaper notes that at the same time, July 9, at the website of the President appeared another document - an order in which he obliged the prime-minister to execute the decision of the [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|RNBO]] and secure the financing of [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007|early elections]]. The newspaper speculated that it was a trade exchange of power for the state dacha. In the late February 2008 Yanukovych confirmed that he indeed possesses a dacha in the Mezhyhirya residency awarded by a presidential decree. According to the data of the State Directorate of Affairs, the territory of residency occupies {{convert|136.8|ha|acre|lk=in}}. It is enclosed in perimeter by a five-meter [tall] iron fence and inside it is secured by operatives of &quot;Titan&quot;. Yanukovych claimed that he only uses one of the houses which has an area of {{convert|250|m²|sqft}} and after which is secured {{convert|1.5|ha|acre}} of land. Yanukovych also stated that with help of the State Directorate of Affairs he was able to conduct a substantial renovations of the property and confirms that in 2007 some area was bought by some private entity after which he had to pay monthly 11,000 hryvnias for rent. In interview to BBC he acknowledged that lives at the Mezhyhirya's cottage sometime since 1999 or 2000.

On July 11, 2007, Yanukovych issued a government order #521, according to which the National Joint-Stock Company &quot;Nadra Ukrainy&quot; received the state residency and a territory of 137 ha in Mezhyhirya. Soon &quot;Nadra Ukrainy&quot; concluded a barter with another company &quot;Medinvesttreid&quot; (Medinvesttrade) after which the above-mentioned government assigned residence was exchanged for two properties at Parkova alleya (''Park alley'') in [[Kiev]]. &quot;Medinvesttreid&quot;, in its turn, sold the newly acquired property of &quot;Nadra Ukrainy&quot; to some other company &quot;Tantalit&quot;. Since May 2008 the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of the Interior]] was conducting a search for the director of &quot;Medinvesttreid&quot;, Hennadiy Herasymenko, who in their opinion was involved in a scheme to get the former state residence out of state property. On February 12, 2008 Yushchenko signed a decree for relieving a state property security personnel from duties at the State cottages area in Mezhyhirya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yushchenko removed state security from Yanukovich's dacha|url=http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/373275-yushchenko-snyal-gosohranu-s-dachi-yanukovicha|accessdate=21 June 2011|newspaper=[[Korrespondent|Korrespondent.net]]|date=February 12, 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His decree canceled the previous presidential decree of January 12, 2006 where the security personnel was assigned to properties at Zalissya, instead of Zalissya and Mezhyhirya.

Subsequently, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych [[privatization|privatized]] the complex, already residing there while prime minister. At the time, the property's price was estimated at around 1 billion [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnias]] ([[United States dollar|$]]200 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Янукович приватизировал резиденцию &quot;Межигорье&quot;|trans_title=Yanukovych privatized the &quot;Mezhigorye&quot; residence|url=http://tema.in.ua/article/?id=2544|work=TEMA|date=December 6, 2007|accessdate=2008-01-03|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Yulia Tymoshenko's election, her cabinet annulled the decree which transferred the property to the &quot;Nadra Ukraine&quot; firm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Ukrainian law|type=Decree of the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]]|number=1230-р|law=1230-2007-р|name=On the nullification of some decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|date=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again placed the territory under government control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tymoshenko gave away the government residence of Yanukovych|url=http://korrespondent.net/business/realestate/327882
