The '''Gypsy Restaurant and Velvet Lounge''' was a restaurant and [[nightclub]] established in 1947 and located along Northwest 21st Avenue in the [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest District]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. Popular with young adults, the restaurant was known for serving fishbowl alcoholic beverages, for its 1950s furnishings, and for hosting [[karaoke]], trivia competitions and [[goldfish]] racing tournaments. The restaurant is said to have influenced local alcohol policies; noise complaints and signs of drunken behavior by patrons made the business a target for curfews and closure. Concept Entertainment owned the restaurant from 1992 until 2014, when it was closed unexpectedly.

Gypsy was also known for serving fishbowl alcoholic beverages,&lt;ref name=Fodors/&gt; and in its final years, for hosting [[goldfish]] racing tournaments.&lt;ref name=Closed/&gt;  The restaurant served soup, sandwiches, and full entrees.&lt;ref name=Mercury/&gt; Karaoke was available beginning at 9 pm on Tuesday through Saturday evenings.&lt;ref name=Fodors/&gt;

==History==
Gypsy Restaurant and Lounge was established in 1947 and was originally located at 612 Northwest 21st Avenue.&lt;ref name=Closed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Safe&gt;{{cite news|title=Restaurant Safe Yields Loot|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=January 14, 1955|location=Portland, Oregon|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, ''The Oregonian'' published an advertisement for business, promoting an eight-course dinner for $1.25, between the hours of 4 pm and 3 am. The restaurant's location was described as &quot;next to 21st Avenue Theater&quot;, between Northwest Hoyt and Irving Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Good News!|page=25|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=January 16, 1948|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, the paper reported that $1,000 was stolen from an unlocked safe stored at the Gypsy Restaurant.&lt;ref name=Safe/&gt; In 1963, the restaurant and lounge moved to its final location, at the intersection of Northwest 21st Avenue and Hoyt Street, across from [[Cinema 21]].&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feb1963/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Francis|title=Behind the Mike|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 25, 1963|location=Portland, Oregon|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On opening night, the &quot;New Gypsy&quot; restaurant reportedly played songs by [[Frank Fontaine]].&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;

[[File:Gypsy Restaurant and Velvet Lounge-4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The restaurant's interior in 2014, shortly after closing]]

According to a 1973 ''Oregonian'' obituary, Gypsy Restaurant was then owned and operated by Stacy Gurganus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Stacy Gurganus|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=December 27, 1973|location=Portland, Oregon|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; An obituary published by ''The Oregonian'' in 1987 said that Gertrude &quot;Tiny&quot; Hursick of [[Lake Oswego, Oregon|Lake Oswego]] co-owned Gypsy and Gordon's 7-Up Bar, also located in Northwest Portland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Gertrude D. Hursick|newspaper=The Sunday Oregonian|date=August 2, 1987|location=Portland, Oregon|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Hursick continued to own and operate the restaurant until the early 1990s; he died in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|edition=Sunrise|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=February 2, 1999|location=Portland, Oregon|page=B08|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of Gypsy transferred to Concept Entertainment in 1992. The company has owned other Portland establishments such as Bar 71,&lt;ref name=Single&gt;{{cite news|title=Single Out Your Scene|date=July 2, 2001|first=Grace|last=Aduroja|edition=Sunrise|page=C01|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barracuda Nightclub,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grand Central Ready for Area 'to Explode'|date=August 9, 2007|first=Tom|last=Hallman, Jr.|edition=Sunrise|page=5|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixie Tavern, [[Grand Central Bowl]], the [[Lotus Cardroom and Cafe]], Quest,&lt;ref name=Single/&gt; and the Thirsty Lion.&lt;ref name=Closed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gunderson|first=Laura|title=Starbucks Goes Venti with the Vino|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 13, 2011|at=Business|edition=Sunrise|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Willamette Week]]'', the restaurant had an &quot;odd&quot; influence on local alcohol policies.&lt;ref name=Closed/&gt; In 1994, city commissioner [[Charlie Hales]] and mayor [[Vera Katz]] sought to close the Gypsy due to repeated reports of assaults, [[public intoxication]], and noise complaints. However, the [[Oregon Liquor Control Commission]] (OLCC) refused.&lt;ref name=Closed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mesh&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wweek.com/portland/article-20440-take_it_inside.html|title=Take It Inside: The City's Latest Bar Brawl with the OLCC: How Late Can Patios Stay Open?|accessdate=February 27, 2014|first=Aaron|last=Mesh|work=Willamette Week|location=Portland, Oregon|date=March 27, 2013|publisher=City of Roses Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, when Hales was the mayor of Portland, he unsuccessfully requested that the OLCC enforce a 10 pm curfew for bar patios within the Portland city limits.&lt;ref name=Closed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mesh/&gt;

In 2007, Gypsy was one of several Portland sites depicted in &quot;Virtual Portland&quot;, a [[3D modeling|three-dimensional]] computer-generated simulation of the city, designed for [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kirah Marikh in Real Life Is a 36-Year-Old Woman|date=April 1, 2007|first=Steve|last=Woodward|edition=Sunrise|at=Sunday Features (O!)|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virtual: One Mission Is to Introduce City to World|date=November 9, 2007|first=Steve|last=Woodward|edition=Sunrise|at=Living|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, a tree limb fell and damaged the restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big tree limb smashes Gypsy Restaurant in NW Portland|url=http://www.wtoc.com/story/22417915/big-tree-limb-smashes-gypsy-restaurant-in-nw-portland|accessdate=December 14, 2014|date=May 24, 2013|publisher=[[WTOC-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=May 24, 2013|title=Tree crashes down on cars, restaurant in NW Portland|url=http://koin.com/2013/05/24/tree-downs-power-lines-in-nw-portland/|publisher=[[KOIN-TV]]|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After operating for more than twenty years, and despite having advertised future events at the club, the business closed abruptly on February 20, 2014.&lt;ref name=Closed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/dining/index.ssf/2014/02/se_portlands_lily_day_cafe_reo.html|title=S.E.

The space that Gypsy had occupied was immediately available for long-term lease, with furniture included.&lt;ref name=Closed/&gt;

==Events==
[[File:Gypsy Restaurant and Velvet Lounge-6.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior signage in 2014]]

Gypsy hosted a variety of musical acts and events throughout its history, including trivia competitions and rock band karaoke, featuring a live backing band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Butler|first=Grant|title=Walkabout|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=March 3, 2011|at=Mix Magazine|edition=Sunrise|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the Chris Conrad Quartet performed in the &quot;Rhythm Room&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Veteran Guitarist Ronnie Montrose to Play at Pine Street|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 21, 1985|location=Portland, Oregon|page=146|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Gypsy hosted opening and closing night parties for Sensory Perceptions' annual film festival, which spanned two weekends at neighboring Cinema 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Festival Reflects on Issues of Sexuality|date=October 13, 2000|first=Shawn|last=Levy|edition=Sunrise|page=24|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly twenty years after the death of [[Andy Warhol]], the Gypsy held a birthday party in his honor in 2006. One ''Oregonian'' contributor called Gypsy a &quot;fitting setting&quot; for the celebration, given its [[lava lamps]] and blue and orange fishbowl drinks, which he said were &quot;like Pop art through a straw&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Happy birthday, Andy Warhol|date=August 11, 2006|first=Lee|last=Williams|edition=Sunrise|page=10|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gypsy partnered with Cinema 21 in 2009 when the theater hosted &quot;Can't Stop the Serenity&quot;, a benefit for [[Equality Now]] that included two screenings of the film ''[[Serenity (film)|Serenity]]'' (2005). Festivities included a costume contest, [[pub quiz]], and ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]]'' karaoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnquist|first=Kristi|title=Movies: Serenity Now|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 26, 2009|location=Portland, Oregon|edition=Sunrise|at=Arts &amp; Entertainment|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pub Quiz USA hosted an &quot;All 'Lost' Trivia Night&quot; at the Gypsy in 2010 for fans of the television program ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnquist|first=Kristi|title=Return with Us Now...|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=January 22, 2010|location=Portland, Oregon|edition=Sunrise|at=Arts &amp; Entertainment|publisher=Oregonian Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gypsy often screened episodes of ''[[Mad Men]]'', the American television series set in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mad Men]]'' screenings:

==Reception==
In 2009, ''The NW Examiner'' included Gypsy in an article about happy hours in Northwest Portland. In her review, Desiree Andrews wrote that the fried artichoke hearts and pub chips were forgettable and recommended the black bean quesadilla. She said, &quot;Overall, the atmosphere was a little too much like a ''Big Lebowski'' hallucination for me, and the food triggered clogged-artery images, but the friendliness of the staff made up for a lot.&quot;&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Desiree|title=Happy Hour Hits|journal=The NW Examiner|date=August 2009|volume=23|issue=12|page=19|url=http://nwexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8August2009.pdf|accessdate=December 12, 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
