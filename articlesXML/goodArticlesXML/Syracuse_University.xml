'''Syracuse University''', commonly referred to as '''Syracuse''', ''''Cuse''', or '''SU''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Marrone's Focus is on the 'Cuse&quot;/&gt; is a private research university in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The institution's roots can be traced to the [[Genesee Wesleyan Seminary]] (later becoming [[Genesee College]]), founded in 1831 by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in [[Lima, New York]]. After several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse, the university was established in 1870, independent of the college. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as [[nonsectarian]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rankingsandreviews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;princetonreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=collegestats/&gt;&lt;ref name=cappex/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse University&quot;/&gt; although it maintains a relationship with [[The United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bylaws&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Relatedness&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;William Joseph Whalen&amp;nbsp;— Hospitals &amp; Universities&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IAMSCU&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SU &amp; UMC&quot;/&gt;

The campus is in the [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] neighborhood of Syracuse, east and southeast of [[Downtown Syracuse|downtown]], on one of the larger hills. Its large campus features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] structures to contemporary buildings. SU is organized into 13 schools and colleges, with nationally recognized programs in [[Syracuse University School of Information Studies|information studies and library science]], [[Syracuse University School of Architecture|architecture]], [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications|communications]], [[business administration]], inclusive education and wellness, [[sport management]], [[public administration]], [[engineering]] and the [[Syracuse University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]].

Syracuse University athletic teams, known as the [[Syracuse Orange|Orange]], participate in 20 intercollegiate sports. SU is a member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] for all [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletics, except for the [[College rowing (United States)|men's rowing]] and women's [[ice hockey]] teams. SU is also a member of the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC)&quot;/&gt;

==History==

===Founding===
The [[Genesee Wesleyan Seminary]] was founded in 1831 by the Genesee [[Annual Conference]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in [[Lima, New York]], south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]. In 1850, it was resolved to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary, becoming [[Genesee College]]. However, the location was soon thought by many to be insufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support.

[[File:Henry Jarvis Raymond.jpg|thumb|left|A graduate of the Genesee Seminary, [[Henry Jarvis Raymond]] later went on to found ''[[The New York Times]]''.]]
The college began looking for a new home at the same time Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search to bring a university to the city, having failed to convince [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] to locate [[Cornell University]] there rather than in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PioneerYears&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt; Syracuse resident White pressed that the new university should locate on the hill in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] (the current location of Syracuse University) due to the city's attractive transportation hub, which would ease the recruitment of faculty, students, and other persons of note. However, as a young carpenter working in Syracuse, Cornell had been twice robbed of his wages,&lt;ref name=reminiscences/&gt;&lt;ref name=university/&gt; and thereafter considered Syracuse a [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] insisting the university be in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] on his large farm on East Hill, overlooking the town and [[Cayuga Lake]].
[[File:GeneseeWesleyanSeminary.png|thumb|right|Genesee Wesleyan Seminary]]
[[File:BelvaLockwood-engraving.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belva Lockwood]] was the second woman, (after [[Victoria Woodhull]]), to run for President of the United States.]]
Meanwhile, there were several years of dispute between the Methodist ministers, Lima, and contending cities across the state, over proposals to move Genesee College to Syracuse. At the time, the ministers wanted a share of the funds from the [[Morrill Land Grant Act]] for Genesee College. They agreed to a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' donation of $25,000 from Senator Cornell in exchange for their (Methodist) support for his bill. Cornell insisted the bargain be written into the bill and Cornell became New York State's Land Grant University in 1865. In 1869, Genesee College obtained New York State approval to move to Syracuse, but Lima got a court injunction to block the move, and Genesee stayed in Lima until it was dissolved in 1875.&lt;ref name=&quot;found&quot;/&gt; By that time, however, the court injunction had been made moot by the founding of a new university on March 24, 1870. On that date the State of New York granted the new Syracuse University its own charter, independent of Genesee College.&lt;ref name=found/&gt;  The City of Syracuse had offered $100,000 to establish the school.&lt;ref name=found/&gt; [[Jesse T. Peck|Bishop Jesse Truesdell Peck]] had donated $25,000 to the proposed school&lt;ref name=&quot;dickinson&quot;/&gt; and was elected the first president of the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt;

Rev. Daniel Steele, a former Genesee College president, served as the first administrative leader of Syracuse until its Chancellor was appointed.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Hill: an illustrated biography of Syracuse University, 1870–present&quot;/&gt; The university opened in September 1871 in rented space downtown.&lt;ref name=found/&gt; George F. Comstock, a member of the new University's Board of Trustees, had offered the school {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of farmland on a hillside to the southeast of the city center. Comstock intended Syracuse University and the hill to develop as an integrated whole; a contemporary account described the latter as &quot;a beautiful town ... springing up on the hillside and a community of refined and cultivated membership ... established near the spot which will soon be the center of a great and beneficent educational institution.&quot;&lt;ref name=architectural/&gt;

[[File:Stephen-Crane-1891.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Crane (front row, left) sits with baseball teammates on the steps of the [[Hall of Languages, Syracuse University]], 1891. (Photo courtesy of the SU Special Collections Research Center)]]
The university was founded as coeducational, and President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies, &quot;The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons... there shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman.... brains and heart shall have a fair chance... &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;coed&quot;/&gt; Syracuse implemented this policy with a high proportion of women students. In the College of Liberal Arts, the ratio between male and female students during the 19th century was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and a low ratio of women enrolled in the College of Medicine and the College of Law.&lt;ref name=coed/&gt; Men and women were taught together in the same courses, and many extra-curricular activities were coeducational as well. Syracuse also developed &quot;women-only&quot; organizations and clubs.&lt;ref name=coed/&gt;

===Expansion===
Coeducation at Syracuse traced its roots to the early days of Genesee College where educators and students like [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and [[Belva Lockwood]] were heavily influenced by the Women's movement in nearby Seneca Falls, NY. However, the progressive &quot;co-ed&quot; policies practiced at Genesee would soon find controversy at the new university in Syracuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt;  Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s. Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics. Dr. [[Erastus Otis Haven]], Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Northwestern University]], maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education. He enrolled his daughter, Frances, at Syracuse where she joined the other newly admitted female students in founding the [[Gamma Phi Beta]] sorority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt;  The inclusion of women in the early days of the university led to the proliferation of various women's clubs and societies. In fact, it was a Syracuse professor who coined the term &quot;sorority&quot; specifically for [[Gamma Phi Beta]].

In the late 1880s the university engaged in a rapid building spree. Holden Observatory (1887) was followed by two Romanesque Revival buildings&amp;nbsp;– von Ranke Library (1889), now Tolley Administration Building, and Crouse College (1889). Together with the Hall of Languages, these first buildings formed the basis for the &quot;Old Row,&quot; a grouping which, along with its companion Lawn, established one of Syracuse's most enduring images.&lt;ref name=&quot;architectural&quot;/&gt; The emphatically linear organization of these buildings along the brow of the hill follows a tradition of American campus planning which dates to the construction of the &quot;Yale Row&quot; in the 1790s. At Syracuse, the Old Row continued to provide the framework for growth well into the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=architectural/&gt;

From its founding until through early 1920s, the university grew rapidly. It offered programs in the physical sciences and modern languages, and in 1873, Syracuse added one of the first architecture programs in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene2&quot;/&gt; In 1874, Syracuse created the nation's first bachelor of fine arts degree,&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse University History&quot;/&gt; and in 1876, the school offered its first post-graduate courses in the College of Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene2&quot;/&gt; SU created its first doctoral program in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;SU1906&quot;/&gt; SU's school of journalism, now the [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]], was established at Syracuse in 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;SU1931&quot;/&gt;

The growth of Syracuse University from a small liberal arts college into a major comprehensive university were due to the efforts of two men, Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James Day]] and [[John Dustin Archbold|John Archbold]]. James Roscoe Day was serving the Calvary Church in New York City where he befriended Archbold. Together, the two dynamic figures would oversee the first of two great periods of campus renewal in Syracuse's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Yates Castle at Syracuse University.jpg|thumb|left|Yates Castle, former home of the School of Education (Photo courtesy of the Syracuse University Archives)]]
[[File:HendricksChapel.jpg|thumb|left|Hendricks Chapel]]John Dustin Archbold was a capitalist, philanthropist, and President of the Board of Trustees at Syracuse University. He was known as John D. Rockefeller's right-hand man and successor at the [[Standard Oil]] Company. He was a close friend of Syracuse University Chancellor James R. Day, and gave almost $6&amp;nbsp;million to the university over his lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt; Said a journalist in 1917:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Archbold's ... is the president of the board of trustees of Syracuse University, an institution which has prospered so remarkably since his connection with it that its student roll has increased from hundreds to over 4,000, including 1,500 young women, placing it in the ranks of the foremost institutions of learning in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Men who are making America&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition to keeping the university financially solvent during its early years, he also contributed funds for eight buildings, including the full cost of Archbold Stadium (opened 1907, demolished 1978), Sims Hall (men's dormitory, 1907), the Archbold Gymnasium (1909, nearly destroyed by fire in 1947, but still in use), and the oval athletic field.

===Modern===
After [[World War II]], Syracuse University began to transform into a major research institution. Enrollment increased in the four years after the war due to the [[G.I. Bill]], which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class.&lt;ref name=&quot;SU1931&quot;/&gt;  Branch campuses were established in [[Endicott, New York]] and [[Utica, New York]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;The velocity with which the university sped through its change into a major research institution was astounding. By the end of the 1950s, Syracuse ranked twelfth nationally in terms of the amount of its sponsored research, and it had over four hundred professors and graduate students engaging in that investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the early 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added programs and staff that continued the transformation of the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and started the first [[pathogen]]-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse University History, 1951–1960&quot;/&gt;  Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.]] donated $15&amp;nbsp;million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the [[SI Newhouse School of Public Communications]]. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the [[Association of American Universities]], an [[organization]] of leading research [[university|universities]] devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic [[research]] and education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse University History, 1961–1970&quot;/&gt;

===Pan Am Flight 103===
[[File:Syracuse University Flight 103 Memorial.jpg|thumb|SU's Flight 103 Memorial]]
{{main article|Pan Am Flight 103}}
On December 21, 1988, 35 Syracuse University students were killed in the terrorist bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] over [[Lockerbie, Scotland|Lockerbie]], [[Scotland]]. The students were returning from a study-abroad program in Europe.

That evening, Syracuse University went on with a [[basketball]] game just hours after the attack, for which it was severely criticized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conduct&quot;/&gt; The conduct of university officials in making the decision was also brought to the attention of the NCAA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conduct&quot;/&gt; The day after the bombing, the university's chancellor, [[Melvin A. Eggers]], said on nationwide television that he should have cancelled the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conduct&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Tragic End to the Semester&quot;/&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks|attacks on September 11, 2001]], the NCAA left it up to the conferences to decide what to do about their sports events; many cancelled them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Many Sporting Events Called Off or Postponed&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pan Am Horror Recalled On the Night 270 People Died, SU Played On&quot;/&gt; (the bombing of Flight 103 was the deadliest terrorist attack against the United States prior to the attacks on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Act of War?–On the 15th Anniversary a Former Pilot Compares the Downing of Pan Am 103 to the Sept. 11, 2001 Attacks on America&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;20 years later, pain of Lockerbie still fresh&quot;/&gt;)

In April 1990, Syracuse University dedicated a memorial wall to the students killed on Flight 103, constructed at the entrance to the main campus in front of the Hall of Languages. Every year the university holds &quot;Remembrance Week&quot; during the fall semester to commemorate the students. On December 21 a service in the university's chapel at 2:03&amp;nbsp;p.m. (19:03&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]]) marks the exact minute on that date in 1988 when the plane exploded. The university also maintains a link to the tragedy with the &quot;Remembrance Scholars&quot; program, when 35 senior students receive scholarships during their final year at the university. With the &quot;Lockerbie Scholars&quot; program, two graduating students from Lockerbie Academy study at Syracuse for one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lockerbie Scholars&quot;/&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:Hall-of-Languages-Syracuse-Univ-2014.jpg|thumb|Hall of Languages]]
[[File:Hendrickschapelsu.jpg|thumb|Hendricks Chapel]]

The university is set on a campus that features an eclectic mix of buildings, ranging from nineteenth-century Romanesque Revival structures to contemporary buildings designed by renowned architects such as [[I.M. Pei]]. The center of campus, with its grass quadrangle, landscaped walkways, and outdoor sculptures, offers students the amenities of a traditional college experience. The university overlooks [[downtown Syracuse]], a medium-sized city (140,600 residents in 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;Best Places to Live-Syracuse, NY&quot;/&gt;  The school also owns a [[Sheraton Hotel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;S.U. Acquires Sheraton Hotel&quot;/&gt; the [[Drumlins Country Club]]&amp;nbsp;— a nearby, 36-hole [[golf course]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Drumlins Country Club. Syracuse, New York.&quot;/&gt; the Fisher Center and [[Joseph Lubin (accountant)|Joseph I. Lubin]] House in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lubin House: Welcome&quot;/&gt; the Paul Greenberg House in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse University Greenberg House&quot;/&gt; and the Minnowbrook Conference Center, a 30-acre (121,000 m²) retreat in the [[Adirondack mountains|Adirondack Mountains]] of [[Upstate New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Minnowbrook Conference Center&quot;/&gt;

===Main campus===
Also called &quot;North Campus,&quot; the Main Campus contains nearly all academic buildings and residence halls. Its centerpiece is The Kenneth A. Shaw Quadrangle, more affectionately known as &quot;The Quad&quot;, which is surrounded by academic and administrative buildings. The North Campus represents a large portion of the [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] neighborhood. Buses run to South Campus, as well as [[downtown Syracuse]] and other locations in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse University Map&quot;/&gt; About 70 percent of students live in university housing. First- and second-year students are required to live on campus. All 22 residence halls are coeducational and each contain a lounge, laundry facility, and various social/study spaces. Residence halls are secured with a card access system. Residence halls are located on both Main Campus and South Campus, the latter of which is a five-minute ride via bus. Learning communities and interest housing options are also available. Food facilities include six residential dining centers, two food courts, and several cafes.

The [[Comstock Tract Buildings]], a historic district of older buildings on the campus, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhptextComstock&quot;/&gt;  Three buildings on campus—the [[Crouse College, Syracuse University|Crouse Memorial College]] and the [[Hall of Languages, Syracuse University|Hall of Languages]], and the [[Pi Chapter House of Psi Upsilon Fraternity]]—are individually listed on the National Register.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

A few blocks walk from Main Campus on East Genesee St, the [[Syracuse Stage]] building includes two [[proscenium]] theatres. The Storch is used primarily by the Drama Department and the Archbold is used primarily by Syracuse Stage, a professional [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatre]].

===South campus===
After World War II, a large, undeveloped hill owned by the university was used to house returning [[veterans]] in military-style campus housing. During the 1970s, this housing was replaced by permanent two-level townhouses for two or three students each, or for graduate family housing. There are also three small residence halls which feature open doubles.
South Campus is also home to the Institute for Sensory Research, Tennity Ice Pavilion, Goldstein Student Center, Skytop Office Building and 621 Skytop Road (for administration), and the InnComplete Pub, a graduate student bar. Just north is the headquarters of SU Athletics located in the Manley Athletics Complex. Approximately 2,500 students live on the South Campus, which is connected to the main campus by frequent bus service.

===Downtown===
[[File:Su Warehouse.jpg|thumb|The Warehouse]]

In December 2004, the university announced that it had purchased or leased twelve buildings in [[downtown Syracuse]]. Five Design Programs; Communication, Advertising, Environmental and Interior Design, Industrial and Interactive Design, and Fashion; reside permanently in the newly renovated facilities, fittingly called [[The Warehouse (Syracuse)|The Warehouse]], which was renovated by [[Gluckman Mayner Architects]]. Both programs were chosen to be located in the downtown area because of their history of working on projects directly with the community. The Warehouse also houses a contemporary art space that commissions, exhibits, and promotes the work of local and international artists in a variety of media. Hundreds of students and faculty have also been affected by the temporary move of the School of Architecture downtown for the $12&amp;nbsp;million renovation of its campus facility, Slocum Hall.

Since 2009, the Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Systems, led by Syracuse University in partnership with [[Clarkson University]] and the [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|College Environmental Science and Forestry]], creates innovations in environmental and energy technologies that improve human health and productivity, security, and sustainability in urban and built environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse Center of Excellence in Environmental and Energy Innovations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Excellence in Environmental and Energy Innovations&quot;/&gt; The [[Department of African American Studies - Syracuse University#Paul Robeson Performing Arts Company (PRPAC)|Paul Robeson Performing Arts Company]] and the [[Department of African American Studies - Syracuse University#Community Folk Art Center (CFAC)|Community Folk Art Center]] will also be located downtown. On March 31, 2006, the university and the city announced an initiative to connect the main campus of the university with the arts and culture areas of downtown Syracuse and The Warehouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welcome to Syracuse University News&quot;/&gt; Using natural gas, the Green Data Center generates its own electricity on site, providing cooling for [[Server (computing)|server]]s and for a neighboring building.&lt;ref name=&quot;go-green&quot;/&gt;

The Connective Corridor project, supported by of public and private funds, will be a strip of cultural development that will connect the main campus of the university to downtown Syracuse, NY. In 2008, an [[Civil engineering|engineering]] firm is studying traffic patterns and lighting to commence the project. A design competition was held to determine the best design for the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Connective Corridor—Project Overview&quot;/&gt;

===Metropolitan satellite locations===
SU has established an admissions presence in Los Angeles, California that will enhance the university's visibility on the West Coast and will join the University's West Coast offices of alumni relations, institutional advancement, and the LA semester program in the same location.

Syracuse University has also established an admissions presence in New York City and Atlanta, Georgia.

Syracuse University's sports teams have &quot;the Orange&quot; nickname since 2004, although the former names of Orangemen and Orangewomen are still used. The school's mascot is [[Otto the Orange]]. SU fields intercollegiate teams in eight men's sports and 12 women's sports.

Most of Syracuse University's intercollegiate teams participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. The [[Syracuse Orange women's ice hockey]] team participates in [[College Hockey America]]. [[College rowing (United States)|Crew]] participates in the [[Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges]]. The men's and women's basketball teams, the football team, and both the men's and women's lacrosse teams play in the [[Carrier Dome]]. Other sports are located at the nearby [[Manley Field House]], except ice hockey which takes place in the [[Tennity Ice Skating Pavilion]].

SU has reached 28 team national championships, including 14 men's lacrosse, six men's crew, two [[cross country running]], and one each in [[boxing]], [[College football|football]], and women's lacrosse.&lt;ref name=&quot;SU Athletics&amp;nbsp;– Syracuse National Champions&quot;/&gt; Under long-time head coach [[Jim Boeheim]], [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|men's basketball team]] won seven [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East]] regular season championships, five [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]] championships, and 25 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances, including the [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2003 NCAA championship]]. The men's basketball team holds the largest on campus attendance record of 35,446 attendees. The record was set in the Carrier Dome playing Duke on Saturday February 1, 2014.

[[File:Syracuse lacrosse at the WH.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse|Syracuse University Orange men's lacrosse team]] are honored at the [[White House]] by [[President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] for their winning the [[2008 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|2008 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I national championship]].]]

In 1959, Syracuse earned its first [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions|National Championship]] following an undefeated football season and a Cotton Bowl victory over [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]]. The team featured sophomore running back [[Ernie Davis]] who, in 1961, became the first African-American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Davis was slated to play for the [[Cleveland Browns]] in the same backfield as [[Jim Brown]], but died of [[leukemia]] before being able to play professionally.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofelmira&quot;/&gt;

Syracuse played its first intercollegiate lacrosse game in 1916, and captured its first USILA championship in 1920. It won USILA championships in 1922, 1924, and 1925. In the modern NCAA era, Syracuse is the first school to capture 11 National Championships, the most of any team in college lacrosse history. Most recently, Syracuse reached the men's Division I championship game in 2013 after winning two championships in 2008 &amp; 2009 seasons and reaching the quarterfinals in 2011. However, the Orange lost 16-10 to [[Duke University]] after leading 5-0 early in the game.&lt;ref name=suathletics/&gt; The women's lacrosse team reached the NCAA Division I National Championship game for the first time in school history in 2012, which they lost to Northwestern.

Toward the end of the 1970s, Syracuse University was under pressure to improve its football facilities in order to remain a NCAA Division I football school. Its small concrete stadium, [[Archbold Stadium]], was seventy years old and not up to the standards of other schools. The stadium could not be expanded; it had been reduced from 40,000 seats to 26,000 due to the fire codes. Syracuse University decided to build a new stadium. In 1978, Archbold Stadium was demolished to make way for the Carrier Dome, which was to have a domed [[Teflon]]-coated, [[fiberglass]] [[air-supported structure|inflatable roof]]. It would also serve as the home for the men's basketball team, as a replacement for Manley Field House. The Carrier Dome was constructed between April 1979 and September 1980. The total construction cost was $26.85&amp;nbsp;million, including a $2.75&amp;nbsp;million [[naming rights|naming gift]] from the [[Carrier Corporation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrier 100th Anniversary: Dome Sweet Dome&quot;/&gt;

==Affiliations==

===Affiliated institutions===

====State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry====
{{Main article|State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry}}

The College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) has a long affiliation with Syracuse University, shares many campus resources, and operates its main academic campus immediately adjacent to Syracuse University. ESF was founded in 1911 as the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee [[Louis Marshall]], with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed the Governor's veto of annual appropriations to a separate [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;agriculture&quot;/&gt;

ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from SU, while resources, facilities, and some infrastructure are shared. The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students at both institutions may take courses at the other, and degrees from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools, as well. The college receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has similar relationships with five [[statutory college]]s that are at [[Alfred University]] and [[Cornell University]].

ESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from SU to take part in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August, and joint commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to libraries, recreational facilities, student clubs, and other activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate sports teams, affiliated with the NCAA and NAIA, respectively. First-year ESF students live in the newly constructed Centennial Hall located on ESF's main campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;The ESF-SU Relationship&quot;/&gt;

====State University of New York Upstate Medical University====
{{main article|State University of New York Upstate Medical University}}

The medical school was formerly a college within SU, known as the Syracuse University Medical School. In 1950, SU sold the medical school to the [[State University of New York]] system. Beginning in the fall of 2009, a [[Master of Public Health]] degree program is now being offered by the two institutions. The program is the first of its kind in Central New York, and the first jointly offered by the two universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse University Offer Joint Master of Public Health Degree in Fall 2009&quot;/&gt;

===Formerly affiliated institutions===

====State University of New York at Binghamton====
{{main article|Binghamton University}}

Binghamton University was established in 1946 as Triple Cities College, to serve the needs of local veterans of the [[Binghamton, New York]] area, who were returning from [[World War II]]. Established in [[Endicott, New York]], the college was a branch of Syracuse University. Triple Cities College offered local students the first two years of their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse University. In 1946, students could earn their degrees entirely at the Binghamton campus. In 1950, it was absorbed by the [[State University of New York]] and renamed Harpur College.&lt;ref name=&quot;About: History&quot;/&gt;

====Utica College====
{{main article|Utica College}}

[[Utica College]], an independent private university located in [[Utica, New York]], was founded by Syracuse University in 1946. Utica College became independent from SU in 1995, but still offers its students the option to receive a specialized bachelor's degree from Syracuse University through a mutual relationship between the two schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fast Facts&quot;/&gt;

Both the conferences and the Board may recommend persons for election as Organization Trustees. Today Syracuse University is considered a Methodist-related institution. Syracuse University's affiliation is expressed in the tradition, though not regulation, of having a United Methodist minister serve as dean of Hendricks Chapel and in the University's participation in the annual University Teacher/Scholar Award sponsored by the Methodist Church. In addition, the University administers a number of Methodist-funded scholarships and houses the Bishop Ledden Endowed Professorship in the Department of Religion.|publisher=Syracuse University|accessdate=March 24, 2012|date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
