{{italic title}}
The '''''{{IAST|Manasollāsa}}''''', also known as '''''Abhilashitartha Chintamani''''', is an early 12th-century Sanskrit text composed by the [[South India]]n king [[Someshvara III]] of the [[Kalyani Chalukya dynasty]]. The text is an encyclopedic work covering topics such as polity, governance, ethics, economics, astronomy, astrology, rhetoric, veterinary medicine, horticulture, perfumes, food, architecture, sports, painting, poetry and music. The text is a valuable source of socio-cultural information on 11th- and 12th-century India.

The encyclopedic treatise is structured as five sub-books with a cumulative total of 100 chapters. It is notable for its extensive discussion of arts, particularly music and dance. It is also notable for including chapters on food recipes and festivals, many of which continue to be a part of modern Indian culture.

Another medieval era Sanskrit text with the title ''Mānasollāsa'' also exists, consisting of devotional praise hymns (''[[stotra]]''), and it is different from the encyclopedic treatise.

The title ''Manasollasa'' (मनसोल्लास) is a compound Sanskrit word, consisting of ''Mana'' (मन) or &quot;mind&quot; and ''Sollasa'' (सोल्लास) or &quot;rejoicing, delighting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&amp;tinput=sollasa&amp;trans=Translate Sollasa], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; It means &quot;the joy, delighter or entertainer of the mind&quot;.{{Sfn|Datta|1988|p=1165}}{{Sfn|McHugh|2012|p=118}} Alternatively, the compound word can be broken as ''Manasa'' and ''Ullasa'', which mean &quot;happiness of mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nalini Sadhale and YL Nene (2010), Bhudharakrida (Royal Enjoyment on a Pleasure-mound) in Manasollasa, Asian Agri-History, Vol. 14, No. 4, pages 319–335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+ullasa&amp;trans=Translate Ullasa], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is divided into five sub-books suffixed as Viṁśati (vinshati, विंशति) which means the number twenty, and refers to the 20 chapters in the sub-book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&amp;tinput=viMzati+&amp;trans=Translate viMzati], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The text, in modern scholarship, is referred by both [[IAST]] spellings &quot;Manasollāsa&quot;,{{Sfn|Banerji|1989|p=238}} and &quot;Mānasollāsa&quot;.{{Sfn|McHugh|2012|pp=154–155}}

The text is also known as the ''Abhilashitartha Chintamani'' ({{IAST|Abhilaṣitārtha Cintāmaṇi}}) (literally, the precious gem that fulfills wish).{{Sfn|Kincaid|Parasanisa|1918|pp=32–33}}{{Sfn|Datta|1988|p=1165}} This text title is spelled ''Manasollāsa'',{{Sfn|Banerji|1989|p=238}} and there is another medieval era Indian text with the title, ''Mānasollāsa'' ({{lang-sa|मानसोल्लास}}), written in [[Stotra]] (poetry of praise) style related to [[Dakshinamurthy|Dakshinamurti]], very different in its scope, and attributed to [[Adi Shankara]] or Suresvara.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Dakshinamurti.Stotra.of.Sri.Sankaracharya.with.Commentaries/Dakshinamurti.Stotra.of.Sri.Sankaracharya.with.Commentaries.by.Suresvaracharya.Swayamprakasa.Ramatirtha#page/n0/mode/2up Dakshinamurti Stotra], A Mahadeva Sastri (1895), see Preface section&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date and author ==
The text was completed in 1129 CE, and the author of the text was Someshvara III. He became the king in 1127,{{Sfn|Kincaid|Parasanisa|1918|pp=32–33}} was part of the Kalyani Chalukya dynasty, and the third king in this dynasty. The year when he succeeded to the throne is approximate, and some scholars state it to be 1125 CE.{{Sfn|Scharfe|1989|p=24}} The author hailed from the medieval [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan region]] consisting of large parts of modern [[Karnataka]], [[Telangana]], western [[Andhra Pradesh]] and southern [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name=sadhalenenefish177&gt;Nalini Sadhale and YL Nene (2005), On Fish in Manasollasa (c. 1131 AD), Asian Agri-History, Vol. 9, No. 3, pages 177–199&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigraphical evidence suggests that the dynasty made numerous land grants and financial awards to the causes of [[Shaivism]] and monastic scholarship.{{Sfn|Reddy|2014|pp=99–101}} These monasteries in the [[Indian peninsula]] became centers of the study of the [[Vedas]] and [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosophies]] such as the [[Nyaya]] school.{{Sfn| Reddy|2014|pp=99–101}} Someshvara III composed this text in the initial years of his kingship.{{Sfn|Banerji|1989|p=238}}

The ''Manasollasa'' encyclopedic treatise was written in Sanskrit in a [[Kannada language]] speaking region ([[Kannadiga]]). The script of the text is [[Devanagari]].{{Sfn|Shrigondekar|1961|p=viii}} The encyclopedia is in poetic verse style.{{Sfn|Datta|1988|p=1165}}{{Sfn|Banerji|1989|p=238}}

It is structured into five sub-books and cumulatively contains 100 chapters. The five ''Vinshatis'' (sub-book of twenties) are subtitled as ''Rājyaprāptikāraṇa'', ''Rājyasya Sthairyakāraṇa'', ''Bhartur Upabhogakāraṇa'', ''Pramoda kāraṇa'' and the ''Krīḍā viṁśati.''{{Sfn|Banerji|1989|p=238}}{{Sfn|Udgaonkar|1986|p=25}} Each chapter deals with a specific topic, ranging from gaining a kingdom, its governance, economics, infrastructure, architecture, medicine,{{Sfn|Joshi|Hebbali|2004}} cuisine, ornaments, perfumery and love-games,{{Sfn|McHugh|2012|pp=118, 131–133}} sports, jewelry, painting, music and dance.{{Sfn|Datta|1988|p=1165}}{{Sfn|Banerji|1989|p=238}}{{Sfn| Shrigondekar|1961|p=vi}} A major part of the text is dedicated to music and musical instruments, with 2500 verses dedicated to it.{{Sfn|Banerji|1989|p=238}}

== Contents ==

=== Kingdom and qualifications of a king: ''Rājyaprāptikāraṇa'' ===
The ''Rajyapraptikarana'' sub-book describes the qualifications of a king and ministers, their duties and moral characteristics that enable the king to rule a stable, prosperous kingdom.{{Sfn|Udgaonkar|1986|p=25}}&lt;ref name=joshijku&gt;{{cite journal|volume =29 |title=Social character of Someshvara III|author=MN Joshi |journal=Journal of the Karnataka University: Humanities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OM5AAAAIAAJ|pages=125–126| year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapter asserts that the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example.&lt;ref name=joshijku /&gt; The king, ministers and citizens should, states the ''Manasollasa's'' first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint, generosity, have faith in gods, feed and support the poor and helpless, and be friendly.{{Sfn|Campbell|1896|p=221}} The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.{{Sfn|Udgaonkar|1986|p=25}}

=== Governance, economics and political stability: ''Rājyasya Sthairyakāraṇa'' ===
The second sub-book ''Rajyasya Sthairyakaraṇa Vimshati'' is dedicated to governance and economic matters to help a king retain the kingdom.{{Sfn|Campbell|1896|p=221}}{{Sfn|Udgaonkar|1986|pp=25–26}}  It describes the ministers and their qualifications, the maintenance, equipment and training of an army with a ''[[Senapati]]'' (general) to command the army, the priests and astrologer as advisors to the king, the treasury and methods of taxation.{{Sfn|Campbell|1896|p=221}}

[[J Duncan M Derrett]], a professor of Oriental Laws, states that chapter 2.8 of the text discusses three kinds of constitutions and recommends that the king should delegate large responsibilities to their ministers, a system that implied that the kingdom was virtually ruled through the ministers.{{Sfn|Derrett|1976|p=439 with footnote 31a}} The ''Manasollasa'' gives a significant role to an [[astrologer]] in the council of advisors to the king who would forecast the auspicious time to respond to an attack, which Hartmut Scharfe, a professor of Indo-European Studies, states proved disastrous during [[Muslim]] and foreign invasion of the Deccan peninsula.{{Sfn|Scharfe|1989|p=24, 118 with footnote 723}}

The delegated form of governance in the existing or acquired provinces is recommended by the text, with the qualification that the province should be ruled by someone born in that province. However, all ministers in immediate vicinity of the king must be born within the long established state.{{Sfn|Scharfe|1989|p=136 with footnotes}} The king, states the text, must watch out and act against bureaucrats and officials who torment his subjects.{{Sfn|Scharfe|1989|p=158 with footnotes}} The text cautions that the king should prevent abuse of his subjects from officials, robbers, enemies, king's favorites and his own greed.{{Sfn|Scharfe|1989|p=24}}

This sub-book also describes various types of ''Shulka'' (taxation).&lt;ref name=&quot;Woolf1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel R. Woolf|title=A Global Encyclopedia of Historical Writing: A-J|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86SbYzbKvmAC&amp;pg=PA851|year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-8153-1514-8|pages=851–852}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th chapter, it explains the [[Customs|tax collected at port of entry]], on goods that arrive at the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandagadde Rama Jois|title=Legal and Constitutional History of India: Ancient legal, judicial, and constitutional system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V552bAz5xFAC|year=1984|publisher=Universal Law Publishing|isbn=978-81-7534-206-4|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second sub-book includes chapters on [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary care]] of animals such as horses and elephants who served the army. Many veterinary ailments are described, ranging from fever to injury to stomach upsets, and the proper nourishment, care of the animals as well as formulations of medicines are outlined in the verses of chapter 2.6 for example.&lt;ref name=sadhaleneneelephant /&gt; The text also includes the names of over forty [[herbs]] used for recipes of veterinary care.&lt;ref name=sadhaleneneelephant /&gt;

=== Food and entertainment: ''Bhartur Upabhogakāraṇa'' ===

}}
The ''Manasollasa'' contains numerous recipes of vegetarian and non-vegetarian [[cuisines]], which according to [[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]], the editor of ''Encyclopedia of Kitchen History'', preceded the [[Cookbook#History|cookbook writing history]] in Europe by a century.{{Sfn|Snodgrass|2004|p=452}} While the text is not the first among Indian books to describe fermented foods, it contains a range of cuisines based on fermentation of cereals and flours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Achaya2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TamangKailasapathy2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author1=Jyoti Prakash Tamang| author2=Kasipathy Kailasapathy| title=Fermented Foods and Beverages of the World| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJTLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16| year= 2010| publisher=CRC Press| isbn=978-1-4200-9496-1| page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among meat dishes, the text does not include the meat of cow, horse, elephant, parrot, peacock or eggs, but describes cuisines based on pork, venison, goat meat, fish among others.{{Sfn|Kamat|1980|p=4}}

The text asserts that fresh water is ''[[Amrita]]'' (nectar) of cuisine, and ''Visha'' (poison) otherwise.{{Sfn|Kamat|1980|p=6}} Someshvara III recommends fresh water from rains (autumn), springs (summer), rivers and lakes (winter) for daily use, after it has been filtered with a clean cloth. The text recommends boiling the water before use, and using the water so prepared within a day.{{Sfn|Kamat|1980|p=6}} For drinking, if boiling is not possible, the text recommends alternate purification method based on ''[[Triphala]]'', and then adding a piece of mango, ''patala'' or ''[[Magnolia champaca|champaka]]'' flower or powder of camphor for flavor and delight.{{Sfn|Kamat|1980|p=6}} The text mentions fresh coconut water, and various drinks called ''Panakas''.{{Sfn|Kamat|1980|pp=6–7}}

The art of preparing wine is described in ''Manasollasa'' from grape and sugarcane, with unusual sources being based on brewing of ''Talimadya'' (palm), ''Narikelasava'' (coconut) and ''Khajurasava'' (date).{{Sfn|Kamat|1980|p=14}}

=== Joy and delight: ''Pramoda kāraṇa'' ===
The fourth sub-book of ''Manasollasa'' deals with entertainment such as music, dance, songs and competitive sports. The text covers dance and music in exclusive chapters, dedicating far more verses to these two topics than first two sub-books combined.{{Sfn|Banerji|1989|p=238}}{{Sfn|Chopra|1992|p=97}} This may reflect the importance of performance arts in 12th-century India, since Someshvara III's son and successor to the throne king [[Jagadekamalla II]] also wrote a famed treatise ''Sangita-chudamani'', literally &quot;crown jewel of music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmie Te Nijenhuis|title=Indian Music: History and Structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrgfAAAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-03978-3|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{multiple image

 | image1 = Tandava.jpg
| image2 = Kathak dance India November 2011.jpg
}}
The text describes various types of songs and music, instruments and dances along with occasions of their performance.{{Sfn|Nijenhuis|1992|p=67}} The ''[[Tripadi]]'', states the text in chapter 4.16, was performed during harvesting and husking season, the ''[[Shatpadi]]'' was performed by folk story tellers, the ''Dhavala'' sung at marriages, while festivals such as [[Holi]] were celebrated with ''Mangala'' and ''Caccari'' genre of songs and music.{{Sfn|Nijenhuis|1992|pp=67, 563 with footnotes 295–301}} The ''Charya'', asserts the text, were songs of meditation.{{Sfn|Nijenhuis|1992|p=67}} The text also claims ''Gana'' (गान) to be a form of &quot;popular music&quot;, and that ''Geet'' that is neither fast nor slow, but contains both high and low notes, where the words and musical meter are equally important to be preferred by spiritual teachers.{{Sfn|Nijenhuis|1992|p=67}}

Rhetoric is discussed in chapter 4.17 of ''Manasollasa''.{{Sfn|Shrigondekar|1961}} The text dedicates over 450 verses in chapter 4.18 to dance and describes various types of dance forms, musical instruments that go with dance performances, and the various occasions when dances were celebrated.{{Sfn|Bose|1991|p=45}} The text discusses six types of performers, their characteristics and their roles – ''Nata'' (actor), ''Nartaka'' (dancer), ''Nartaki'' (danseuse), ''Vaitalika'' (bard), ''Charana'' (wandering performer) and ''Kollatika'' (acrobat).{{Sfn|Bose|1991|p=45}} Their body movements (6 ''Anga'',  8 ''Upanga'' and 6 ''Pratyanga'') are explained in the text with their significance. This discussion is similar to that found in ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', a Sanskrit text composed around 1st-century BCE.{{Sfn|Bose|1991|pp=45–46}} The text thereafter presents the 21 ''Sthanas'' and 26 ''Charis'' of the dance tradition.{{Sfn|Bose|1991|pp=45–46}} The discussion on dance movements is compiled by six categories – mimetic (''[[natya]]''), delicate (''[[lasya]]''), vigorous (''[[tandava]]''), acrobatic (''visama''), ludicrious (''[[vikata]]'') and graceful (''[[laghu]]'').{{Sfn|Bose|1991|pp=46–47, 141–142}}

The fourth sub-book also describes various sports, such as fishing,&lt;ref name=sadhalenenefish177 /&gt; dog (greyhound-type) racing,&lt;ref&gt;Nalini Sadhale and YL Nene (2010), Sarameyavinoda in Manasollasa: Dogs for Recreation and Hunting, Asian Agri-History, Vol. 14, No. 3, pages 273–283&lt;/ref&gt; horse racing, elephant racing as well as archery, wrestling and athletics.{{Sfn|Kamat|1980|pp=72–75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. R. Sundararajan|author2=Bithika Mukerji| title=Hindu Spirituality: Postclassical and Modern| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUWIEfAY-mMC | year=2003| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1937-5| page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text also describes some unique team sports, such as a form of Indian [[polo]] involving two teams of eight members each.{{Sfn|Kamat|1980|pp=81–82}}

=== Games, arts and leisure: ''Krīḍā viṁśati'' ===
