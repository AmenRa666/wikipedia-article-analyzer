'''Roaring Creek''' is a [[tributary]] of the [[Susquehanna River]] in [[Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Columbia County]] and [[Montour County, Pennsylvania|Montour County]], in [[Pennsylvania]], in the United States. It is slightly more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} long and flows through [[Roaring Creek Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Roaring Creek Township]], [[Locust Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Locust Township]], [[Catawissa Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Catawissa Township]], [[Cleveland Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Cleveland Township]], and [[Franklin Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Franklin Township]] in Columbia County and [[Mayberry Township, Montour County, Pennsylvania|Mayberry Township]] in Montour County.&lt;ref name = &quot;nationalmap&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author = [[United States Geological Survey]]|url = http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/|title = The National Map Viewer|accessdate = April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the creek has an area of {{convert|87.3|sqmi|km2}}. It has three named tributaries: South Branch Roaring Creek, Lick Run, and Mill Creek. The creek is not considered to be impaired and is not affected by coal mining. However, its watershed has been impacted by human land use. [[Claystone]]s, [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], [[sandstone]]s, [[siltstone]]s, and [[shale]]s all occur within the watershed. The creek flows through a gorge in its lower reaches, along the border between Columbia County and Montour County.

Most of the watershed of Roaring Creek is in Columbia County, but small areas are in Montour County, Northumberland County, and Schuylkill County. More than 40 percent of the watershed is forested and nearly 40 percent is agricultural land. State game lands and state forests are also in the watershed. A total of approximately 3,500 people inhabit the watershed, as of 2000. The creek's drainage basin is a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery upstream of Lick Run. Downstream of Lick Run, the main stem is a Trout Stocked Fishery and Migratory Fishery. A reach of the creek above Lick Run is designated as [[Class A Wild Trout Waters]]. 31 species of fish were observed at 20 sites in the watershed in 2003 and 2004.

Roaring Creek was historically known as Popemetang, but it was known as Roaring Creek by the late 1700s. Settlers such as [[Quaker]]s first arrived in the area in the 1770s. In the 19th century, various mills and furnaces were constructed on the creek and several bridges were constructed. Agriculture was also a major industry in the watershed in the early 20th century. More bridges were constructed across the creek in the 20th century. The Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association formed in February 2006. Part of the creek is navigable by canoe.

==Course==
[[File:Roaring Creek (Pennsylvania) in springtime.JPG|thumb|left|Roaring Creek in springtime]]
Roaring Creek begins on [[Catawissa Mountain]] in Roaring Creek Township, Columbia County. It flows west-southwest for a short distance before turning south for a few tenths of a mile. It then turns west for a few miles and flows off Catawissa Mountain before eventually crossing State Route 2003, passing Mill Grove, and entering Locust Township. The creek turns north-northwest for a few tenths of a mile and reenters Roaring Creek Township before turning west and reentering Locust Township. It then flows west-northwest for more than a mile and receives Mill Creek, its first named tributary, from the [[wikt:right bank|right]], as well as receiving the tributary Lick Run from the [[wikt:left bank|left]]. The creek then turns northwest for more than a mile and enters [[Slabtown, Pennsylvania|Slabtown]] before turning west for several tenths of a mile and crossing [[Pennsylvania Route 42]]. After this, it turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before meandering west-southwest for a few miles, passing Queen City, Parrs Mill, and a lake known as [[Lake Glory]]. In this stretch, the creek leaves Locust Township and crosses the border between Catawissa Township and Cleveland Township three or four times before entering Franklin Township. Near Pennsyl's Mill, The creek then [[meander]]s northwest for a few miles, crossing [[Pennsylvania Route 487]] and receiving South Branch Roaring Creek, its least named tributary, from the left. Upon reaching the Montour County line, the creek turns north for a few miles, flowing along the border between Franklin Township, Columbia County and Mayberry Township, Montour County. In this reach, it passes through a gorge with Sharp Ridge on the west. After a few miles, the creek leaves the gorge and crosses State Route 3012. A few tenths of a mile further downstream, it reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River.&lt;ref name = &quot;nationalmap&quot;/&gt;

Roaring Creek joins the Susquehanna River {{convert|142.36|mi|km}} upriver of its mouth.&lt;ref name = &quot;gaz&quot;&gt;{{Citation|publisher = [[Lycoming University]]|url = http://www.lycoming.edu/cwi/pdfs/paGazetterOfStreams.pdf|title = Pennsylvania Gazetteer of Streams|pages = 85, 100, 120, 132|date = November 2, 2001|accessdate = April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tributaries===
Roaring Creek has three named tributaries: South Branch Roaring Creek, Lick Run, and Mill Creek.&lt;ref name = &quot;nationalmap&quot;/&gt; South Branch Roaring Creek joins Roaring Creek {{convert|4.28|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of {{convert|35.9|sqmi|km2}}. Lick Run joins Roaring Creek {{convert|14.08|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of {{convert|5.97|sqmi|km2}}. Mill Creek joins Roaring Creek {{convert|15.02|mi|km}} upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of {{convert|4.98|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;gaz&quot;/&gt;

==Hydrology==
The concentration of [[alkalinity]] in Roaring Creek upstream of Lick Run is 9 milligrams per liter.&lt;ref name = &quot;classa&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author = [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]]|url = http://fishandboat.com/classa.pdf|title = Class A Wild Trout Waters|page = 17|date = December 16, 2013|accessdate = April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nearby watersheds have been rendered nearly devoid of [[aquatic life]] due to [[acid mine drainage]] caused by [[coal mining]]. However, Roaring Creek has not been affected by this, although it has been still impacted by human land use. [[Sedimentation]], [[siltation]], and agricultural impacts occur in the watershed. The only impaired stream in the watershed is a small unnamed tributary that is impaired by siltation. From a chemical standpoint, Roaring Creek is infertile.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt;

The [[specific conductance]] of Roraing Creek ranges from 11 [[siemens (unit)|micro-siemens]] per centimeter at site 2 to 127 micro-siemens per centimeter at site 4. In 2003 and 2004, the [[pH]] of the creek ranged from 7.0 to 7.2. In a later survey, it was found to be acidic at sites 1 and 2 (6.50 and 6.89, respectively), but alkaline at sites 3 and 4 (7.34 and 8.27, respectively). The concentration of [[alkalinity]] in the creek ranges from 5.1 milligrams per liter at site 1 to 32 milligrams per liter at site 2. The concentration of [[water hardness]] ranges from 28 milligrams per liter at river mile 4.04 to 44 milligrams per liter at river mile 8.54. The [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] of the creek is 12.2 liters per second at site 1, 243.5 liters per second at site 2, 216.7 liters per second at site 3, and 271.6 liters per second at site 4.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt;

The concentration of [[nitrogen]] in Roaring Creek ranges from 956.5 micrograms per liter at site 1 to 2343.1 micrograms per liter at site 2. The [[phosphorus]] concentration ranges from 12.6 micrograms per liter at site 1 to 28.6 micrograms per liter at site 2.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt;

More than 40 percent of the watershed of Roaring Creek is on [[forest]]ed land, including [[evergreen]] and [[deciduous]] forests, as well as [[mixed forest]]s. A significant portion of the forested land in the watershed is a {{convert|9000|acre|ha}} tract of land along South Branch Roaring Creek. This tract was acquired by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] in 2003.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt; A large tract of forested land on a ridge running from [[Moosic, Pennsylvania|Moosic]] to the Susquehanna River passes through the watershed of Roaring Creek.&lt;ref name = &quot;inventory&quot;/&gt; [[State forest]] land occurs along the southern edge of the watershed and [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]] ([[Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58]]) occur along the eastern edge. Nearly 40 percent of the watershed is on [[agriculture|agricultural]] land.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt; This land use occurs in the creek's valley, as does open space.&lt;ref name = &quot;comprehensiveplan&quot;/&gt;

Upstream of Lick Run, 13 percent of Roaring Creek is on public land that is open to access. The remaining 87 percent is on private land that is closed to access.&lt;ref name = &quot;classa&quot;/&gt; The remaining reaches of the creek are entirely on private land, but open to access. As of 2000, approximately 3,500 people live in the watershed. In section 01, the population density of the watershed is 18 people per square kilometer as of 2000. In section 02, the population density is 22 people per square kilometer and in section 03, the population density is 16 people per square kilometer. In section 01 of the creek, 50 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 89 percent is within 300 meters, and 91 percent is within 500 meters. In section 02, 28 percent is within 100 meters, 87 percent is within 300 meters, and 100 percent is within 500 meters. In section 03, 96 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 98 percent is within 300 meters of one, and 100 percent is within 500 meters of one.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt; The creek flows through a remote-seeming farm valley for a substantial part of its length.&lt;ref name = &quot;gertler&quot;/&gt; Major roads in or near the watershed include [[Pennsylvania Route 487]], [[Pennsylvania Route 54]], and [[Pennsylvania Route 42]].&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt;

Visual assessment of Roaring Creek was carried out by Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association volunteers at four locations in October and November 2007.

==History and etymology==
Roaring Creek was entered into the [[Geographic Names Information System]] on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1185166.&lt;ref name = &quot;gnis&quot;/&gt;

Roaring Creek was known to the [[Lenni Lenape]] as ''Popemetang'', which means &quot;Roaring Creek&quot; in English.&lt;ref name = &quot;placenames&quot;/&gt; This name likely originates from the waterfalls and rapids on the creek's lower reaches.&lt;ref name = &quot;200years&quot;/&gt; The creek was known as Popemetang until the late 1700s. However, several maps were referring to it as Roaring Creek as early as 1792.&lt;ref name = &quot;placenames&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author = [[Walter M. Brasch]]|publisher = Columbia County Historical Society|title = Columbia County Place Names|page = 185|year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name appears as Roaring Creek in even the earliest survey warrants in the area.&lt;ref name = &quot;battle&quot;/&gt;

The Centre Turnpike was constructed in 1770 and provided access to the valley of Roaring Creek, roughly following the current course of Pennsylvania Route 487 and Pennsylvania Route 54.

In the early 1900s, major industries in the watershed of Roaring Creek included [[agriculture]]. However, the creek was also used as [[water power]] for a small [[gristmill]]. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Roaring Creek and Bear Gap. Their populations were 407 and 124, respectively.&lt;ref name = &quot;waterresources&quot;/&gt; In the early 1900s, the only major industries in Franklin Township were gristmills on the creek on the border between it and Cleveland Township. There were historically proposals to use the creek as a [[water supply]] for [[Danville, Pennsylvania|Danville]], transferring the water via [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]] under the Susquehanna River.&lt;ref name = &quot;annals&quot;/&gt; Andrew Trone once constructed a hotel on the creek.&lt;ref name = &quot;battle&quot;/&gt;

Many bridges have been constructed across Roaring Creek and a number of [[covered bridge]]s can be seen from the creek.&lt;ref name = &quot;gertler&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;uglybridges&quot;/&gt; The first bridge over the creek was constructed in 1874 at Slabtown for a cost of $1500.

In 2003, Martin Friday assessed streams in the watershed of Roaring Creek at 37 locations, using the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|United States Environmental Protection Agency's]] rapid assessment protocol. In 2004, Robert Wnuk carried out fisheries surveys on every named stream in the watershed. The [[Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association]] formed in February 2006 to conserve the natural and cultural resources of the Roaring Creek watershed.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author = Catherine D.

==Biology==
Upstream of the tributary Lick Run, the drainage basin of Roaring Creek is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From Lick Run downstream to its mouth, the [[main stem]] of the creek is a Trout-Stocking Fishery and a Migratory Fishery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|work = [[Pennsylvania Code]]|url = http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/025/chapter93/s93.9k.html|title = Â§ 93.9k.

In 2003 and 2004, 31 fish species were found at 20 sites in the watershed of Roaring Creek. [[Blacknose dace]] are the most common fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of the sites. [[White sucker]]s and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of the sites, [[longnose dace]] occurred at 70 percent of the sites, [[cutlips minnow]]s occurred at 65 percent of the sites, and [[bluegill]]s occurred at 60 percent of the sites. [[Fallfish]], [[golden shiner]]s, [[yellow bullhead]]s, and [[American eel]]s were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, [[redside dace]], [[creek chubsucker]]s, [[green sunfish]], and [[fathead minnow]]s were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of [[brook trout]] were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include [[rainbow trout]]. [[smallmouth bass]], [[largemouth bass]], and [[chain pickerel]].&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt;

The [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of wild brown trout in section 02 of Roaring Creek was estimated in the early 2000s to be 9.53 kilograms per hectare. There were an estimated 42 brown trout of legal size per kilometer of stream. This equates to an estimated 815 brown trout between {{convert|7|and|16|in|cm}} in length in that section. The trout in section 02 of the creek are up to approximately {{convert|400|mm|in}} in length and some brown trout in the creek can reach lengths of up to {{convert|22|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author = [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]]|url = http://fishandboat.com/images/fisheries/afm/2004/4_06-10roaring.htm|title = Roaring Creek (Stocked Area) Columbia County June 2004|date = June 2004|accessdate = April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Waterfowl]] have been known to inhabit the watershed of Roaring Creek.&lt;ref name = &quot;soil survey&quot;/&gt;

Various [[macroinvertebrate]] taxa inhabit Roaring Creek. At one site, there is one abundant macroinvertebrate taxon, with 25 to 100 individuals being observed. At this site, there are five common taxa and five present taxa, with 10 to 25 and 3 to 9 individuals being observed, respectively. Eleven taxa are rare, with fewer than three individuals being observed. At another site, there are two abundant taxa, three common taxa, four present taxa, and eight rare taxa. At a third site on the creek, there are three abundant taxa, four common taxa, three present taxa, and seven rare taxa.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt;

[[Hardwood]] trees and [[tsuga|hemlocks]] occur on the slopes of the valley of Roaring Creek. Hemlocks also occur in the creek's gorge.&lt;ref name = &quot;gertler&quot;/&gt; The canopy coverage at four sites on the creek ranges from 0 percent to 75 percent. The [[algae|algal]] biomass of the creek ranges from 0.01 to 1.21 in terms of [[chlorophyll a]] per square centimeter.&lt;ref name = &quot;coldwaterheritage&quot;/&gt; The Roaring Creek Bluffs are listed on the Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory. [[Dodecatheon radicatum|Jeweled shooting-star]], which is threatened in Pennsylvania, occurs at this site.&lt;ref name = &quot;inventory&quot;/&gt; Other plant species in this area include [[hydrangea]], [[fragile fern]], [[maidenhair spleenwort]], [[golden saxifrage]]. However, several [[weed]]y plants also grow in the area.&lt;ref name = &quot;inventory&quot;/&gt;

==Recreation==
It is possible to [[canoe]] on {{convert|13.0|mi|km}} of Roaring Creek, from Slabtown to the mouth during fast [[snowmelt]] or within three days of heavy rain. The difficulty rating of the creek ranges from 1 to 2+. Edward Gertler's book ''Keystone Canoeing'' describes the scenery as being &quot;fair to good&quot;. The book describes the creek itself as being &quot;a small and easy-to-overlook wet weather stream&quot;. There are two painted canoe gauges on the creek, one at Pennsylvania Route 42 and the other at Pennsylvania Route 487.&lt;ref name = &quot;gertler&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author = Edward Gertler|publisher = Seneca Press|title = Keystone Canoeing|page = 233|year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
