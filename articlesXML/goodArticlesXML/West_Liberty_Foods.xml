'''West Liberty Foods, [[Limited liability company|L.L.C.]]''' is a US [[meat packing industry|meat processing]] company owned by the Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative and formed in 1996&lt;ref name=&quot;Young1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Young, Barbara |title = Growth Essentials. |work = National Provisioner, The |date = May 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by a group of [[Iowa]] [[Domesticated turkey|turkey]] growers,&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = O’Keefe, Terrence |year = 2003 |title = A Slice of the Future |url = http://www.wlfoods.com/0703wp26.pdf |publisher = West Liberty Foods |accessdate = 2006-06-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060329082524/http://www.wlfoods.com/0703wp26.pdf |archivedate = March 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now owns four meat processing plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plants&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wlfoods.com/about/plants.htm |title=Plants |accessdate=07-05 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070307112647/http://www.wlfoods.com/about/plants.htm |archivedate = March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company mainly produces [[Product (business)|products]] for [[customers]] to sell under their own brand names.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt; As of 2006, West liberty Foods was the 12th largest turkey company in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = O’Keefe, Terrence |url = http://www.wattpoultryusa-digital.com/wattpoultryusa/200702/?pg=64 |title = Top Turkey Company Profiles |work = Watt Poultry USA |date = February 2007 |accessdate = 2007-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has four facilities in three states. Headquartered in [[West Liberty, Iowa]] the company has a vertically integrated turkey plant in [[West Liberty]] that processes 200 million pounds&lt;ref&gt;Estimated fiscal 2014 live weight&lt;/ref&gt; of live turkeys annually. The company also has manufacturing facilities in [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa]], [[Tremonton, Utah]], and [[Bolingbrook, Illinois]]. The company has over a 400MM pound capacity to further process multiple proteins including turkey, ham, chicken, and beef.

While West Liberty Foods has experienced growth and received industry recognition since its inception, it initially faced a difficult market for turkeys, and has experienced problems with labor discontent. [[Employment|Employees]] remain with the company for an average of nine years,&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt; with more than 1,500 employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Young, Barbara |title = Extraordinary Chief Executive. |work = National Provisioner, The |date = January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company primarily provides meat for other marketing brands, producing 90% of its product for customers while selling only 10% under the West Liberty Foods brand name. In addition to slaughtering turkeys, the company produces prepared beef, chicken, pork, and turkey products.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  Company [[revenue]] has grown rapidly with US$65 million in sales during 1997, US$120 million in 2000, and US$200 million in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wlfoods.com/news/meatprocess.html |title=The Iowa Phoenix |accessdate=August 14, 2006 |date=October 2000 |work=Meat Processing |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060329082642/http://www.wlfoods.com/news/meatprocess.html |archivedate = March 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recently, West Liberty Foods posted US$442 million in revenue for 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe2&quot; /&gt; making the company the 56th largest meat packing company by sales in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazdziak&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Gazdziak, Sam |title = The National Provisioner's Top 125. |work = National Provisioner, The |page = 56 |date = May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the company's sales come from large nationwide [[foodservice]] customers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Young3&quot; /&gt; and, as of 2006, was [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s largest supplier of sliced sandwich meat, providing the [[franchising|franchise]] with more than 1 million pounds per week.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt; As a result of servicing national customers, the company is inspected more than other food manufacturers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grocer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlfoods.com/news/iowa-gr.htm |title= West Liberty Foods Finds Success with Cooperation |accessdate=August 14, 2006 |year=2006 |work=Iowa Grocer |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060329082713/http://www.wlfoods.com/news/iowa-gr.htm |archivedate = March 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Liberty Foods' three plants have been [[ISO 14000|ISO 14001]] certified for meeting environmental management standards, and the West Liberty plant was the first turkey processing plant in the United States to receive this [[Professional certification|certification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Enviro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wlfoods.com/about/environment.htm |title=Environment |accessdate=August 14, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060618232122/http://wlfoods.com/about/environment.htm |archivedate = June 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Liberty Foods maintains separate facilities for [[research and development]] and laboratory [[Experiment|testing]] services.  They are housed in adjacent buildings several blocks from the plant in West Liberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young1&quot; /&gt;  The R&amp;D facility includes testing space for both [[raw food|raw]] and cooked product, and can create test products from start to finish, including initial formulation, final slicing, and [[Packaging and labelling|packaging]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Young1&quot; /&gt;  The lab conducts product quality testing for the three production facilities and uses [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technology for rapid bacteriological testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Bagel, Ann |title = Food Safety First |work = Poultry |page = 16 |date = Apr–May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system can return results within 30 hours of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1996, [[Oscar Mayer|Louis Rich]], the brand name for [[Oscar Mayer]]'s turkey [[Division (organisation)|division]], owned the processing plant in West Liberty, IA.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  In early 1996, Oscar Mayer's parent company, [[Kraft Foods]], announced that they would close the plant that December if no buyer purchased it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grocer&quot; /&gt;  The Iowa turkey growers who sold to Kraft discussed purchasing the plant to ensure that [[Supply and demand|demand]] for their birds remained.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  In May 1996, forty-seven of the turkey growers formed the Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative(ITGC).&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  ITGC purchased the plant from Kraft and took control of it in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  The growers hired meat industry veteran Ken Rutledge to be President and COO of the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Find&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wlfoods.com/news/niche.html |title=Finding the Right Niche |accessdate=August 14, 2006 |date=October 2006 |work=Meat Processing |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060329082721/http://www.wlfoods.com/news/niche.html |archivedate = March 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar Mayer helped West Liberty Foods by promising to purchase half of the plant's output in 1997 and a quarter of the output in 1998 to help the [[startup company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author =Associated Press | title =Low Prices Hurt Turkey Co-Op | work =Telegraph Herald | page =A5 | date =December 15, 1997 | accessdate =2006-07-31 }}, cited at Newsbank/Infoweb&lt;/ref&gt;

Production under ITGC ownership began in January 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  The company faced financial difficulty because the turkey market was oversupplied and prices hit historic lows.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  While financial projections assumed a price of US$1.92 per pound for turkey, prices averaged US$1.46 per pound in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot; /&gt; During this time period, four of the growers left ITGC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grocer&quot; /&gt;  Turkey prices eventually rebounded, and the company was bolstered by sales to [[Sara Lee (corporation)|Sara Lee]] near the end of 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;

Since the rebound, West Liberty Foods’ sales have grown steadily.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  In 2000, the company acquired a second plant in Sigourney, IA from [[Pinnacle Foods]] to meet rising [[Order (business)|orders]].The facility was sold in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  The company grew again in April 2003 when it opened a processing plant in Mount Pleasant, IA which was later expanded in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Young, Barbara |title = Branding Food Safety. |work = National Provisioner, The |date = May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Company leadership changed in 2004 as Ed Garrett was named president and COO when Rutledge resigned to take a position with another growers' organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Change&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=11094778&amp;BRD=1105&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=151632&amp;rfi=8 |title = Change at the Top of WL Foods |work = West Liberty Index |date = March 9, 2004 | accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the company entered into a marketing alliance agreement with [[Midvale, Utah]] based [[Norbest Foods]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Release&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlfoods.com/about/news.htm |title=News and Press Releases http |accessdate=August 14, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060618231756/http://wlfoods.com/about/news.htm |archivedate = June 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor episode==
In 2004, [[Labour (economics)|workers]] at the West Liberty plant considered joining the [[United Food and Commercial Workers|United Food and Commercial Workers International Union]] (UFCW).&lt;ref name=&quot;Limbo&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Ervin, Stacy |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=12235105&amp;BRD=1105&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=151632&amp;rfi=8 |title = West Liberty Foods Vote in Limbo |work = West Liberty Index |date = July 6, 2004 |accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 1, 2004 the workers voted on whether they would be represented by UFCW Local 431.&lt;ref name=&quot;Limbo&quot; /&gt;  An initial tally of votes came out 301 in favor and 299 against [[trade union|union]] representation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Limbo&quot; /&gt;  However, the count did not include 13 ballots which were disputed by UFCW.&lt;ref name=&quot;Limbo&quot; /&gt;  The ballots were challenged on claims that they were cast by management personnel who would not be union members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Limbo&quot; /&gt;

A [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) hearing to confirm or invalidate the vote was scheduled for January 5, 2005 but then postponed until February 16, 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Konrad, Sara |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=13726507&amp;BRD=1105&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=151632&amp;rfi=8 |title = West Liberty Foods Hearing Postponed |work = West Liberty Index  |date = January 11, 2005 |accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 1, 2005 the company and UFCW settled their dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Settle&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Konrad, Sara |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=14011552&amp;BRD=1105&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=151632&amp;rfi=8 |title = WL Foods, Labor Union Reach Settlement |work = West Liberty Index |date = February 22, 2005 |accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  UFCW withdrew its objections, and West Liberty Foods posted a [[notice]] that they would not close the plant or fire workers if employees unionized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Settle&quot; /&gt;  This resulted in a final vote count of 303 to 308 against union representation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Settle&quot; /&gt;

UFCW Local 431 held a second vote at the West Liberty plant on July 15, 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vote&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Becker, Sarah |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=14883933&amp;BRD=1105&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=151632&amp;rfi=8 |title = Workers Vote Down Union |work = West Liberty Index |date = July 19, 2005 |accessdate = 2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vote was 231 to 322 against unionization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vote&quot; /&gt;

In 2009, the company paid US$58,613.75 to Labor Information Services, an anti-union management services company connected to [[The Burke Group]], to provide consultants who met directly with workers &quot;either individually or in group meetings...regarding union issues.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OLMS_LM-21_2010-02-25&quot;&gt;{{Cite OLMS|filenum=C-0464|rptId=414246|rptForm=LM21Form|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==
[[File:WLF Plants.jpg|frame|right|Locations of the three West Liberty Foods plants in Iowa]]

West Liberty Foods' three plants combined can convert 4.5 million turkeys into product annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young3&quot; /&gt;  This equals approximately 180 million pounds of product per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young3&quot; /&gt;

===West Liberty plant===
The West Liberty Plant is a {{convert|270000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility which slaughters and further processes turkey products.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  The slaughter operation converts approximately 20,000 turkeys per [[Working time|workday]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Perkins&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first =Jerry | last =Perkins | title =West Liberty Foods packs in success | work =Des Moines Register, The | page =1M | date =May 22, 2005 | accessdate =2006-07-31 }}, cited at Newsbank/Infoweb&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis H. Rich, purchased the West Liberty plant, a former tomato canning facility, in 1943, when he decided to expand the operations of the Rock Island Produce Company, located on 9th Street in [[Rock Island, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  The plant was converted to a poultry, including chickens and turkeys, slaughter facility in 1946 and refocused by Rich's sons, Norman and Martin, on turkey in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix&quot; /&gt;  The plant was first expanded in 1960.  Oscar Mayer acquired the plant, through its purchase of Louis Rich, Inc., in 1979 and used it for turkey production until selling the plant in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix&quot; /&gt;

===Mount Pleasant plant===
The Mount Pleasant plant is a {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility that is used for slicing cooked cheese, turkey, chicken, beef, pork and other products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;  The plant employs approximately 500 people&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe2&quot; /&gt; working in three shifts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2&quot; /&gt;  A {{convert|68000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Millard Refrigerated Services facility is located adjacent to the Mount Pleasant plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;  The two facilities are connected, and product is immediately transferred by [[Conveyor belt|conveyor]] from the plant to cold storage when packaging is complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;

The design and operation of the Mount Pleasant plant to are intended decrease potential hazards to food safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author = Lazar, Virginia |title = Listeria Benchmark: 0 |work = Meat Processing |page = 26 |date = November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WLF representatives have stated that the goal of the Mount Pleasant plant is to create a [[pathogen]]-free environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazar&quot; /&gt;  Because company officials believe that the food safety aspects of the plant are unique in the meat industry, they submitted the plant design for patent approval through the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2&quot; /&gt; The Mount Pleasant plant is located approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} from either the West Liberty or Sigourney plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2&quot; /&gt;  This reduces the likelihood that pathogens will be carried either by air or foot traffic from a raw production area to Mount Pleasant's ready to eat production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2&quot; /&gt;

The Mount Pleasant facility consists of approximately 20 individual processing cells that are separated from one another and are set up so that they could operate as individual meat slicing facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot;/&gt;  Before anti-microbial [[flooring]] was poured, the cells were erected with [[stainless steel]] [[Antimicrobial|anti-microbial]] walls that are built into the floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazar&quot; /&gt;  Each processing cell has independent refrigeration and [[drainage]] systems.  The refrigeration systems [[Air filter|filter]] the cell's air and maintain positive [[Pressure|air pressure]] at {{convert|38|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, and the drainage systems are sealed off and flooded with sanitizers nightly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;

During operation, fully cooked meat or cheese logs arrive sealed in impermeable [[Casing (sausage)|casings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;  The logs go through a casing sanitation step that involves being treated with a sanitizing liquid before the casings are removed from the logs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;  The logs then undergo a post-lethality treatment by passing through an [[infrared]] [[pasteurization]] tunnel to kill pathogens on the logs.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Keefe&quot; /&gt;  The logs are then mechanically transferred to slicers, sliced, and placed in sealed packages that are transferred out of the processing cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;  The mechanical transfers decrease the risk of product contamination by reducing handling of product by personnel .&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagel&quot; /&gt;

Food safety is a factor in hiring employees at the Mount Pleasant facility.  Before applying, potential employees must complete a 16-hour food safety training course through [[Iowa State University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazar&quot; /&gt;  The class includes written tests which each applicant must pass before completing the course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazar&quot; /&gt;  On the job, employees must don a sealed [[clean room suit]] before entering slicing cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazar&quot; /&gt;  The suits are cleaned and sealed in a [[clean room]] laundry facility in [[North Carolina]] by the uniform company [[Cintas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazar&quot; /&gt;  Employees replace the clean suit each time they leave the cell so each employee averages five suits per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazar&quot; /&gt;

===Sigourney plant===
The Sigourney plant is no longer active, and has been closed. The remaining employees were released as of Wed. March 18, 2009.
West Liberty sold the facility in 2012.
