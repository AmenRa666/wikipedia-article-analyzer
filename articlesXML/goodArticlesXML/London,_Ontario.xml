'''London''' is a city located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], [[Canada]] along the [[Quebec City–Windsor Corridor]]. The city has a population of 366,151 according to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian census]]. London is at the confluence of the non-navigable [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames River]], approximately halfway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The City of London is a separated municipality, [[List of Ontario separated municipalities|politically separate]] from [[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]], though it remains the county seat.

London and the Thames were named in 1793 by [[John Graves Simcoe]], who proposed the site for the capital of [[Upper Canada]]. The first European settlement was between 1801 and 1804 by Peter Hagerman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=St-Denis, Guy|title=Byron:Pioneer Days in Westminster Township|publisher=Crinklaw Press|year=1985|isbn=0-919939-10-4|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village was founded in 1826 and [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1855. Since then, London has grown to be the largest Southwestern Ontario municipality and Canada's 11th largest municipality, having annexed many of the smaller communities that surrounded it.

London is a regional centre of health care and education, being home to the [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Fanshawe College]], and several hospitals. The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centred on education, medical research, [[insurance]], and [[information technology]]. London's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction of [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] and [[Ontario Highway 402|402]], connecting it to Toronto, Windsor, and [[Sarnia]]. It also has an [[London International Airport|international airport]], train and bus station.

== History ==

=== Founding ===

Prior to European contact in the 18th century, the present site of London was occupied by several [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]] and [[Odawa people|Odawa]]/[[Ojibwa]] villages. Archaeological investigations in the region indicate that [[aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] people have resided in the area for at least the past 10,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;asc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/archeo/emercury/159.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930050430/http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/archeo/emercury/159.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 |title=An Early Paleo-Indian Site near Parkhill, Ontario |last=Ellis |first=Christopher |author2=Deller, D Brian |publisher=ASC Publications|accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current location of London was selected as the site of the future capital of [[Upper Canada]] in 1793 by [[Lieutenant governor|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[John Graves Simcoe]]. Simcoe intended to name the settlement ''Georgina'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerogina&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario: Containing an Outline of the History of the Dominion of Canada; a History of the City of Toronto and the County of York, with the Townships, Towns, General and Local Statistics; Biographical Sketches (Part II: The County of York)| last1=Adam| first1=Graeme Mercer| last2=Mulvany| first2=Charles Pelham| last3=Robinson| first3=Christopher Blackett| volume=1| page=9| publisher=C.B. Robinson| year=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; in honour of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], and renamed the river. However, the choice of a capital site in the midst of extensive hardwood forests was rejected by [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton (Governor Dorchester)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spelt&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Spelt| first=J| title=Urban development in south-central Ontario| publisher=McClelland and Stewart| year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, there was a skirmish during the [[War of 1812]] in what is now southwest London at Reservoir Hill, formerly Hungerford Hill.&lt;ref name=&quot;omb01&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ul.london.on.ca/urbanweb/News/News2005/OMBreservoirhill.pdf| title=Reservoir Hill| date=February 2001| publisher=Ontario Municipal Board| page=40| accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village of London, named after the English capital of [[London]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lon&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LAEAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22named+after+london%22%22London,+Ontario+%22&amp;dq=%22named+after+london%22%22London,+Ontario+%22 |title=Canada: wonderland of surprises|author1=Max Braithwaite |publisher=Dodd, Mead|year=1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was not founded until 1826, and not as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] Simcoe envisioned.  Rather, it was an administrative seat for the area west of the actual capital, [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now Toronto).  Locally, it was part of the [[Talbot Settlement]], named for Colonel [[Thomas Talbot (Upper Canada)|Thomas Talbot]], the chief coloniser of the area, who oversaw the land surveying and built the first [[Government Buildings|government buildings]] for the administration of the Western Ontario peninsular region.  Together with the rest of Southwestern Ontario, the village benefited from Talbot's provisions, not only for building and maintaining roads, but also for assignment of access priorities to main routes to productive land.&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/d.aspx?s=/About_London/london_history.htm|title=The beginnings| year=2009| publisher=City of London| accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Crown and [[clergy reserve]]s were receiving preference in the rest of Ontario.

In 1832, the new settlement suffered an outbreak of [[cholera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/d.aspx?s=/About_London/timeline1-2.htm| title=Event Highlights for the City of London 1793–1843| publisher=City of London| accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; London proved a centre of strong [[Tory]] support during the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] of 1837, notwithstanding a brief rebellion led by [[Charles Duncombe (Upper Canada Rebellion)|Charles Duncombe]].  Consequently, the British government located its Ontario peninsular garrison there in 1838, increasing its population with soldiers and their dependents, and the business support populations they required.&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot; /&gt; London was incorporated as a town in 1840.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline1&quot; /&gt;

On 13 April 1845, fire destroyed much of London, which was at the time largely constructed of wooden buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/d.aspx?s=/About_London/timeline3.htm| title=Event Highlights for the City of London 1844–1894| publisher=City of London| accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first casualties was the town's only [[fire engine]]. This fire burned nearly 30 acres of land destroying 150 buildings before burning itself out later the same day. One-fifth of London was destroyed and this was the province's first million dollar fire.&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite book| first=Bill| last=Adams| title=The History of the London Fire Department of heroes, helmets and hoses| publisher=London Fire Department| edition=1st| year=2002| page=13| isbn=0-9732159-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1855, London was incorporated as a &quot;city&quot; (10,000 or more residents).&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot; /&gt; In the 1860s, a sulphur spring was discovered at the forks of the Thames River while industrialists were drilling for [[Petroleum|oil]].&lt;ref name=sulphur&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.londonhistory.org/bath.htm| accessdate=2 June 2008| title=Ontario White Sulphur Springs| publisher=The London and Middlesex Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The springs became a popular destination for wealthy Ontarians, until the turn of the 20th century when a [[textiles|textile]] [[factory]] was built at the site, replacing the spa.

Long before the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a 3 month long military courses from 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in London. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill and discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~theislands/photos6/ansonkeillmilcert.jpg Anson Keill's Second class certificate from the School of Military Instruction, Kingston]&lt;/ref&gt; The school was not retained at Confederation, in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Preston 'Canada's RMC: A History of the Royal Military College of Canada' published by the RMC Club by U of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===

[[File:Blackfriars Bridge WPC.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Blackfriars Street Bridge]]
Sir [[John Carling]], Tory MP for London, gave three events to explain the development of London in a 1901 speech. They were: the location of the court and administration in London in 1826; the arrival of the military garrison in 1838; and the arrival of the railway in 1853.&lt;ref name=lutman&gt;{{cite book| last=Lutman| first=John| title=The Historic Heart of London| publisher=Corporation of the City of London| year=1977| page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, London's first iron bridge, the [[Blackfriars Street Bridge]], was constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline2&quot; /&gt; It replaced a succession of flood-failed wooden structures that had provided the city's only northern road crossing of the river.  A rare example of a bowstring [[truss bridge]], the Blackfriars remains open to pedestrian and bicycle traffic, though it is currently closed indefinitely to vehicular traffic due to various structural problems.&lt;ref name=amoore&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blackburnnews.com/london/2013/12/19/blackfriars-bridge-opens-to-pedestrians/ |title=Blackfriars Bridge Open To Pedestrians |first=Avery |last=Moore |publisher=Blackburn News |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blackfriars, amidst the river-distance between the [[Carling]] Brewery and the historic [[Labatt Park|Tecumseh Park]] (including a major mill), linked London with its western suburb of Petersville, named for Squire Peters of Grosvenor Lodge. That community joined with the southern subdivision of Kensington in 1874, formally incorporating as the municipality of Petersville.  Although it changed its name in 1880 to the more inclusive &quot;London West&quot;, it remained a separate municipality until ratepayers voted for amalgamation with London in 1897,&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot; /&gt; largely due to repeated flooding.  The most serious flood was that of July 1883, which resulted in serious loss of life and property devaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Stott| first=Gregory| title=The Maintenance of Suburban Autonomy: The Story of the Village of Petersville-London West, Ontario, 1874–1897| degree=MA| publisher=University of Western Ontario| year=1999| chapter=Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area retains much original and attractively maintained 19th-century tradespeople's and workers' housing, including [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] cottages as well as larger houses, and a distinct [[sense of place]].

London's eastern suburb, London East, was (and remains) an industrial centre, which also incorporated in 1874.&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot; /&gt; Attaining the status of town in 1881,&lt;ref name=&quot;9b&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://council.london.ca/meetings/Archives/Agendas/Planning%20Committee%20Agendas/Planning%20Committee%20Agendas%202004/2004-08-30%20Agenda/Item%209b.pdf| title=Item 9b| publisher=London Advisory Committee on heritage| accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it continued as a separate municipality until concerns over expensive waterworks and other fiscal problems led to amalgamation in 1885.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilson&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.londonhistory.org/Londoneast.htm| title=London East| last=Wilson| first=Robert| publisher=London and Middlesex Historical Society| accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern suburb of London, including Wortley Village, was collectively known as &quot;London South&quot;.  Never incorporated, the South was annexed to the city in 1890,&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot; /&gt; although Wortley Village still retains a distinct [[sense of place]]. By contrast, the settlement at Broughdale on the city's north end had a clear identity, adjoined the university, and was not annexed until 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;broughdale&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://broughdale.ca/|title=Broughdale Community Association| publisher=BCA| accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 1881, the [[ferry]] ''SS Victoria'' capsized in the Thames River, [[drowning]] approximately 200 passengers, the worst disaster in London's history.

London's role as a military centre continued into the 20th century during the two [[World War]]s, serving as the administrative centre for the Western Ontario district. In 1905, the London Armoury was built and housed the First Hussars until 1975.  A private investor purchased the historic site and built a new hotel (Delta London Armouries, 1996)in its place preserving the shell of the historic building. In the 1950s, two reserve battalions amalgamated and became [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|London and Oxford Rifles (3rd Battalion), The Royal Canadian Regiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dnd&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/land-terre/units-unites/index-eng.asp?action=City&amp;id=39&amp;rid=267#267| title=London, Ontario| publisher=Department of National Defence| accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This unit continues to serve today as 4th Battalion, [[The Royal Canadian Regiment]].  The Regimental Headquarters of [[The Royal Canadian Regiment]] remains in London at Wolseley Barracks on Oxford Street. The barracks are home to the First Hussars militia regiment as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnd&quot; /&gt;

=== Annexation to present ===
London [[annexation|annexed]] many of the surrounding communities in 1961, including [[Byron, Ontario|Byron]] and Masonville, adding 60,000 people and more than doubling its area.&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot; /&gt; After this amalgamation, suburban growth accelerated as London grew outward in all directions, creating expansive new subdivisions such as Westmount, Oakridge, Whitehills, Pond Mills, White Oaks and Stoneybrook.&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot; /&gt;

In 1992, London annexed nearly the entire township of [[Westminster, Middlesex County, Ontario|Westminster]], a large, primarily [[rural municipality]] directly south of the city, including the [[police village]] of [[Lambeth, Middlesex County, Ontario|Lambeth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline10&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/About-London/london-history/Pages/1977-to-2000.aspx| title=History of London - 1977 to 2000| publisher=City of London| accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this massive annexation, London almost doubled in area again, adding several thousand more residents. London now stretches south to the boundary with [[Elgin County]].

The 1993 annexation made London one of the largest urban municipalities in Ontario.&lt;ref name=&quot;martin07&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:s9hkV_RIV10J:www.lfpress.ca/cgi-bin/publish.cgi%3Fp%3D220108%26s%3Dsociete+%22did+annexation+work%3F%22&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca| title=Did Annexation Work?| last=Martin| first=Chip| date=29 December 2007| work=Special Report| publisher=London Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intense commercial and residential development is presently occurring in the southwest and northwest areas of the city.

== Geography ==
The area was formed during the retreat of the [[glacier]]s during the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], which produced areas of [[marshland]], notably the [[Sifton Bog]] (which is actually a [[fen]]), as well as some of the most agriculturally productive areas of farmland in Ontario.&lt;ref name=&quot;hd-ON&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?Params=A1ARTA0005936&amp;PgNm=TCE| title=Ontario| year=2009| publisher=Historica-Dominion| accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Thames River dominates London's geography. The North and South branches of the Thames River meet at the centre of the city, a location known as &quot;The Forks&quot; or &quot;The Fork of the Thames.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;parks&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/d.aspx?s=/Parks_and_Natural_Areas/Parks_guide.htm| title=Your Guide to London's Major Public Parks &amp; Gardens| publisher=City of London| accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Thames runs through the man-made Fanshawe Lake, located in northeast London. Fanshawe Lake was created by Fanshawe Dam, constructed to protect the downriver areas from the catastrophic flooding which affected the city in 1883 and 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;dam&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thamesriver.on.ca/Water_Management/Fanshawe_Dam.htm| title=Fanshawe Dam| publisher=Upper Thames River Conservation Authority| accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
[[File:LONDONMORNING.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown London on a winter morning in January 2011]]
London has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), though due to its downwind location relative to Lake Huron and elevation changes across the city, it is virtually on the Dfa/Dfb (hot summer) boundary favouring the former climate zone to the southwest of the confluence of the South and North Thames Rivers, and the latter zone to the northeast (including the airport). Because of its location in the continent, London experiences large [[seasonal]] contrast, tempered to a point by the surrounding [[Great Lakes]]. The summers are usually warm to hot and humid, with a July average of {{convert|20.8|C|1}}, and temperatures above {{convert|30|C}} occur on average 10 days per year.&lt;ref name=CCN/&gt; In 2016, however, temperatures at or above {{convert|30|C}} occurred more than 35 times. The city is affected by frequent thunderstorms due to hot, humid summer weather, as well as the [[Convergence zone|convergence of breezes]] originating from [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Erie]]. The same convergence zone is responsible for spawning funnel clouds and the occasional tornado. London is located in Canada's [[Tornado Alley]]. Spring and autumn in between are not long, and winters are cold but witness frequent thaws. Annual precipitation averages {{convert|1011.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}. Its winter snowfall totals are heavy, averaging about {{convert|194|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref name=CCN /&gt; The majority of it comes from [[lake effect snow]] and [[snow squalls]] originating from Lake Huron, some {{convert|60|km||abbr=on|0}} to the northwest, which occurs when strong, cold winds blow from that direction. From 5 December 2010, to 9 December 2010, London experienced record snowfall when up to {{convert|2|m|in|0||abbr=on}} of snow fell in parts of the city. Schools and businesses were closed for three days and bus service was cancelled after the second day of snow.&lt;ref name=&quot;lfpress.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2010/12/07/16460466.html| accessdate=5 April 2012|title=It's one for the history books|newspaper=London Free Press| last=Daniszewski| first=Hank| date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest temperature ever recorded in London was {{convert|41.1|C|0}} on 6 August 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;August 1918&quot;&gt;

{{See also|London City Council|List of mayors of London, Ontario}}
[[File:Wellington Road Downtown London.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Wellington Street in downtown London viewed atop London City Hall]]
London's [[Local government|municipal government]] is divided among fourteen [[councillor]]s (one representing each of London's fourteen [[ward (politics)|wards]]) and the [[mayor]]. [[Matt Brown (Canadian politician)|Matt Brown]] was elected mayor in the [[London, Ontario municipal election, 2014|2014 municipal election]], officially taking office {{as of|2014|12|1|alt=on 1 December 2014}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://london.ctvnews.ca/matt-brown-elected-as-new-mayor-of-london-1.2074064 &quot;Matt Brown elected as new mayor of London&quot;]. [[CFPL-DT|CTV London]], 27 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Brown's election, London's [[List of mayors of London, Ontario|most recent elected mayor]] was [[Joe Fontana]]; following Fontana's resignation on 19 June 2014, city councillor Joe Swan served as [[acting mayor]]&lt;ref name=resign&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.torontosun.com/2014/06/19/joe-fontana-officially-resigns-as-mayor-of-london| title=Joe Fontana officially resigns as mayor of London| work=Toronto Sun| date=19 June 2014| last=Maloney| first=Patrick| accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; until councillor Joni Baechler was selected as interim mayor 24 June.&lt;ref name=replace&gt;{{cite news| title=London, Ont. names new mayor to replace Fontana| url=http://www.torontosun.com/2014/06/24/london-ont-names-new-mayor-to-replace-fontana| work=Toronto Sun| date=24 June 2014| agency=Québecor Média| last=Maloney| first=Patrick| accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the elections in 2010, there was a [[Board of Control (municipal government)|Board of Control]], consisting of four controllers and the mayor, all elected city-wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;council&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/d.aspx?s=/City_Council/default.htm| title=Your December 2006 - November 2010 Council| year=2006| publisher=City of London| accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of [[London City Council]] was challenged by two ballot questions during the civic election of 2003.  A proposal to restructure the municipal government would have reduced the council to ten wards and eliminated the Board of Control.  The council could not come to a determination and as a result decided to put two questions on the ballot for the fall 2003 election: whether city council should be reduced in size and whether the Board of Control should be eliminated. While the &quot;yes&quot; votes prevailed in both instances, the [[voter turnout]] failed to exceed 50 per cent and was therefore insufficient to make the decisions binding under the ''Municipal Act''.  When the council voted to retain the [[status quo]], Imagine London, a citizens group, petitioned the [[Ontario Municipal Board]] (OMB) to change the ward composition of the city from seven wards in a roughly [[wikt:radial|radial]] pattern from the downtown core, to 14 wards defined by [[community of interest|communities of interest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;omb&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.omb.gov.on.ca/e-decisions/pl050623_%233072.pdf| title=PL050623| date=November 2005| publisher=Ontario Municipal Board| accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OMB ruled for the petitioners in December 2005 and, while the city sought leave to appeal the OMB decision via the courts, leave was denied on 28 February 2006, in a decision of Superior Court's Justice McDermid.&lt;ref name=&quot;sher&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Judge rejects ward appeal| last=Sher| first=Jonathan| date=1 March 2006| publisher=London Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the city conceded change, but asked for special legislation from the province to ensure that there will only be one councillor in each of the 14 new wards, not two. 1 June 2006, the Ontario bill received [[Royal Assent|royal assent]], which guarantees that London will have one councillor per ward.&lt;ref name=&quot;ON06act&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?BillID=419&amp;isCurrent=false| title=An Act respecting the City of London| date=June 2006| publisher=Government of Ontario| accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although London has many ties to Middlesex County, it is now &quot;separated&quot; and the two have no jurisdictional overlap. The exception is the Middlesex County courthouse and former jail, as the judiciary is administered directly by the province.&lt;ref name=middlesex&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.county.middlesex.on.ca/CountyInformation/About_Middlesex.asp| title=Middlesex County Information| publisher=Middlesex County| accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|provincial government]], London is represented by [[Ontario Liberal Party|Liberal]] [[Deb Matthews]] ([[London North Centre (provincial electoral district)|London North Centre]]); [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] [[Jeff Yurek]] ([[Elgin—Middlesex—London (provincial electoral district)|Elgin—Middlesex—London]]), and [[Ontario New Democratic Party|NDPs]]: [[Teresa Armstrong]] ([[London—Fanshawe (provincial electoral district)|London—Fanshawe]]) and [[Peggy Sattler]] ([[London West (provincial electoral district)|London West]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/members/members_current.do?locale=en&amp;ord=Riding&amp;dir=ASC&amp;list_type=all_mpps| title=Current MPPs| publisher=Legislative Assembly of Ontario| accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Canadian House of Commons|federal government]], London is represented by Conservative [[Karen Vecchio]] ([[Elgin—Middlesex—London]]), Liberals [[Peter Fragiskatos]] ([[London North Centre]]) and [[Kate Young (politician)|Kate Young]] (London West), and NDP [[Irene Mathyssen]] ([[London—Fanshawe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://webinfo.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/MainMPsCompleteList.aspx?TimePeriod=Current&amp;Language=E| title=Members of Parliament| publisher=Parliament of Canada| accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the City of London first published their [[Facilities Accessibility Design Standards (FADS)]] which was one of the first North American municipal [[accessibility]] requirements to include [[Universal Design]]. It has since been adopted by over 50 municipalities in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.london.ca/city-hall/accessibility/Pages/Facilities-Accessibility-Design-Standards.aspx| title=Facilities Accessibility Design Standards (FADS)| year=2016| publisher=City of London Ontario| accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Serial killing ===
Between 1959 and 1984, London contained the largest concentration of [[serial killers]] in the world, as the city was startled by 29 murders.  During that time period, up to six serial killers may have been operating in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Suen | first = Fan-Yee | title = Serial-Killer Capital of the World?

=== Civic initiatives ===
The City of London initiatives in Old East London are helping to create a renewed sense of vigour in the East London Business District. Specific initiatives include the creation of the Old East Heritage Conservation District under Part V of the ''Ontario Heritage Act'', special Building Code policies and Facade Restoration Programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oldeastvillage.com/pdf_reports/Re-establishingValue-aPlanfortheOldEastVillage.pdf| title=Re-establishing Value| publisher=Ontario Professional Planners Institute| accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Londoners have become protective of the trees in the city, protesting &quot;unnecessary&quot; removal of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.londonkiosk.ca/london-tourism.php| title=London Tourism Information| year=2009| publisher=London Kiosk| accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City Council and tourist industry have created projects to replant trees throughout the city. As well, they have begun to erect metal trees of various colours in the downtown area, causing some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/pdf/Gazette-2008-09-30.pdf| title=Metal Tree Planting Continues| last=Haggarty| first=Jaclyn| date=30 September 2008 |newspaper=UWO Gazette| page=1| accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Veterans Memorial Parkway, London, Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Intersection along the [[Veterans Memorial Parkway]], an at-grade [[limited-access road|expressway]]]]
Since the 1970s, London has improved urban road alignments that eliminated &quot;jogs&quot; in established traffic patterns over 19th-century street mis-alignments. The lack of a municipal [[freeway]] (either through or around the city) as well as the presence of two significant railways (each with attendant switching yards and few over/under-passes) are the primary causes of [[rush hour]] congestion, along with construction and heavy snow. Thus, traffic times can be significantly variable, although major traffic jams are rare.&lt;ref name=&quot;master&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.london.ca/city-hall/master-plans-reports/master-plans/Documents/Transportation%20Master%20Plan.pdf| title=Transportation Master Plan| date=May 2013| publisher=City of London| pages=2–23| accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington Road between Commissioners Road E and Southdale Road E is London's busiest section of roadway, with more than 46,000 vehicles using the span on an average day&lt;ref name=volume&gt;{{cite web| title= City of London Traffic Volume Data| author=City of London| date=2013| url=http://www.london.ca/residents/Roads-Transportation/traffic-management/Pages/Traffic-Volumes.aspx| accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; City council rejected early plans for the construction of a freeway, and instead accepted the [[Veterans Memorial Parkway]] to serve the east end.&lt;ref name=&quot;long-term&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Long-Term Transportation Corridor Protection Study| publisher=City of London| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913040755/http://london.ca/d.aspx?s=/Transportation/corridorstudy.htm| archivedate=13 September 2013| url=http://london.ca/d.aspx?s=/Transportation/corridorstudy.htm| accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Londoners have expressed concern that the absence of a local freeway may hinder London's economic and population growth, while others have voiced concern that such a freeway would destroy environmentally sensitive areas and further contribute to London's suburban sprawl.&lt;ref name=&quot;master&quot; /&gt; Road capacity improvements have been made to Veterans Memorial Parkway (formerly named Airport Road and [[Highway 100 (Ontario)|Highway 100]]) in the industrialized east end.&lt;ref name=401images&gt;{{cite web| archivedate=7 August 2007| title=King's Highway 401 - Images| last=Steeves| first=Scott| year=2004| url=http://www.onthighways.com/hwy_401_images/Hwy401_p4_images.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807234534/http://onthighways.com/hwy_401_images/Hwy401_p4_images.htm| accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Parkway has received criticism for not being built as a proper highway; a recent city-run study suggested upgrading it by replacing the intersections with interchanges.&lt;ref name=veterans07&gt;{{cite web| title=Veterans Memorial Parkway| year=2007| publisher=City of London| url=http://www.london.ca/residents/Environment/EAs/Documents/VMP-PicBoard2.pdf| accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public transit ===
[[File:London Transit New Flyer.jpg|thumb|London Transit Commission Bus]]
London's [[Public transport|public transit]] system is run by the [[London Transit|London Transit Commission]], which has 44 bus routes throughout the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;transit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltconline.ca/Routes.htm|title=Routes and Schedules|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=London Transit Commission|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the city has lost ridership over the last few years, the commission is making concerted efforts to enhance services by implementing a five year improvement plan. In 2015, an additional 17,000 hours of bus service was added throughout the city. In 2016, 11 new operators, 5 new busses, and another 17,0000 hours of bus service were added to the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfpress.com/2016/08/16/more-hours-new-names-for-routes-coming-next-month-as-overhaul-of-the-london-transit-commission-enters-next-phase|title=LTC rolling out big changes|last=nurun.com|website=The London Free Press|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bus service is currently the only mode of public transit available to the public in London, with no available [[rapid transit]] networks like those used in other Canadian cities. However, city council approved a [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) business case in May 2016 that will see a rapid transit system running in L- and 7-shaped corridors throughout the city. Construction is expected to begin in 2018, with the service fully operational by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.shiftlondon.ca/timeline|title=Timeline|newspaper=Shift|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; London does have several [[taxicab|taxi]] and for-hire [[limousine]] services.

=== Plans ===
[[File:London International Airport arrivals outside.jpg|thumb|left|[[London International Airport]]]]
The city of London is considering [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) and/or [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s (HOV) to help it achieve its long-term transportation plan.  Additional cycleways are planned for integration in road-widening projects, where there is need and sufficient space along routes.  An [[limited-access road|expressway]]/freeway network is possible along the eastern and western ends of the city, from [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] (and [[Ontario Highway 402|Highway 402]] for the western route) past Oxford Street, potentially with another highway, joining the two in the city's north end.&lt;ref name=&quot;master&quot;/&gt;

The City of London has assessed the entire length of the Veterans Memorial Parkway, identifying areas where interchanges can be constructed, grade separations can occur, and where [[cul-de-sac]]s can be placed. Upon completion, the Veterans Memorial Parkway would no longer be an expressway, but a freeway, for the majority of its length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Veterans Memorial Parkway Interchange Class Environmental Assessment Study and Concurrent Application to Amend the Official Plan and Zoning By-Law| author= City of London and Giffels| date= 13 December 2007| url= http://www.london.ca/residents/Environment/EAs/Documents/VMP-PicBoard2.pdf| accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[high-speed rail]] station has been proposed for London, connecting it to a future high-speed rail line along the Quebec City-Windsor corridor. It would run along the [[Canadian National]] rail right of way through the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Map of Proposed High Speed Rail routes along the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor|author1=Transport Canada |author2=Ontario Ministry of Transportation |author3=Transports Quebec | date= 14 June 2011| url= http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/pubs/high-speed-rail/map/254-P020563-112_Localisation_3000000_2010-06-14.pdf| accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
