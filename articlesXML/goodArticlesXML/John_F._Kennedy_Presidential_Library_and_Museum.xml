}}The '''John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum''' is the [[presidential library]] and [[museum]] of [[John F. Kennedy|John Fitzgerald Kennedy]], the [[List of Presidents of the United States|35th]] [[President of the United States]] (1961&amp;ndash;1963). It is located on [[Columbia Point, Boston|Columbia Point]] in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] neighborhood of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], next to the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]], the [[Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate]], and the [[Massachusetts Archives|Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum]]. Designed by the architect [[I. M. Pei]], the building is the official repository for original papers and correspondence of the Kennedy Administration, as well as special bodies of published and unpublished materials, such as books and papers by and about [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The library and museum were dedicated in 1979 by President [[Jimmy Carter]] and members of the [[Kennedy family]]. It can be reached from nearby [[Interstate 93]] or via [[Public transport|shuttle bus]] or walk from the [[JFK/UMass (MBTA station)|JFK/UMass]] stop on the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Boston subway's Red line]].

==Location, design and dedication==

===Original site and name===
During a weekend visit to [[Boston]] on October 19, 1963, President Kennedy, along with [[John Carl Warnecke]] — the architect who would design the President’s  [[John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame|tomb in Arlington]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot;&gt;{{cite news

At the time there were only four other [[Presidential Library|Presidential Libraries]]: the [[Hoover Presidential Library]], the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library|Franklin D. Roosevelt Library]], the [[Truman Library]], and the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower Library]]. They were all scattered around the country in small towns from New York to Iowa. Kennedy had not decided on any design concept yet, but he felt that the existing presidential libraries were placed too &quot;far away from scholarly resources.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;

Kennedy chose a plot of land next to the [[Harvard Business School|Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt; The building would face the [[Charles River]] which was a few feet away, and on the other side of which, the dormitories that included [[Winthrop House]] where Kennedy spent his upperclassman days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;

Since Kennedy encouraged his [[Kennedy administration|administration]] to save effects of both personal and official nature, the complex would not just be a collection of the President's papers, but &quot;a complete record of a Presidential era.&quot; And so, the building would have the word museum appended to its name: '''John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot; /&gt;

===Initial progress===
After [[John F. Kennedy assassination|President Kennedy was assassinated]] in November 1963, his [[Kennedy family|family]] and friends discussed how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months, and visited with architects from around the world including [[Pietro Belluschi]] and others from the United States, Brazil's [[Lucio Costa]], and Italy's [[Franco Albini]]. Mrs. Kennedy and others met with the candidates together at the [[Kennedy Compound]] in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]], and visited several in their offices. The committee also conducted a secretive process whereby the architects voted anonymously for the most capable of their colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp. 96–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress on the building began shortly after his death. On January 13, 1964, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] announced that a taped [[oral history|oral-history]] project was to be undertaken for inclusion in the library. The project would feature administration staff, friends, family, and politicians from home and abroad. The Attorney General also announced that [[Eugene R. Black, Sr.]] agreed to serve as chairman of the board of trustees and that $1 million of Black’s $10 million goal had been given to the trust by the [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisJanuary&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The death of the President was still fresh in the hearts and minds of the American public and by March of that year $4.3 million had been pledged, including 18,727 unsolicited donations from the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMarch&quot;&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large donations came from the Hispanic world with [[Venezuela]] pledging $100,000 and [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] [[Luis Muñoz Marín]] offering the same. The oral-history project also began recording, starting with Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. Originally projected to consist of interviews with 150 people, 178 had agreed to participate and the total number of expected participants doubled to 300, with just one person (a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent) declining to take part.&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMarch&quot; /&gt;

Also by this time fourteen architects were named to serve on a design advisory committee:&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMarch&quot; /&gt;

Over the following months pledges continued to funnel in for the building still being conceptualized by the various architects. Some notable donations include $900,000 handed over to [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[John A. Gronouski]] on July 9, 1964. It was the sum of a campaign encompassing 102 Federal agencies. Gronouski said many of the Federal employee contributions were in the form of a $5 withholding each payday for a period of three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmployeeContributions&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Pei selected as architect===

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Pei was relatively unknown amongst the list of candidates, Mrs. Kennedy, who viewed him as filled with promise and imagination and after spending several months inspecting the many architects’ offices and creations, selected him to create the vision she held for the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfkl.org-Pei&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url= http://www.jfklibrary.org/About-Us/About-the-JFK-Library/History/IM-Pei--Architect.aspx
 | title= I. M. Pei, Architect
 | accessdate= March 1, 2015
 | publisher= John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Foundation
 | quote= &quot;At an early meeting in 1964, Mr. Pei explained to Mrs. Kennedy, somewhat apologetically, that as a relatively young architect he had not worked on monumental projects. Though relatively unknown and obscure at the time, Mrs. Kennedy nevertheless selected Pei from a list of candidates that included of some America’s best-known architects. He seemed to her so filled with promise and he had the imagination and temperament to create a structure that would reinforce her vision of the goals of the library.&quot; &quot;The Kennedy Library was erected on a landfill site overlooking Boston, Dorchester Bay, and the ocean beyond. To overcome existing conditions, the site was raised {{convert|15|ft|m}}.&quot;
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pei did not have a design yet, but the idea as described by Robert Kennedy was to “stimulate interest in politics.” Meanwhile, the suggestion that Harvard may not be a suitable site for the library had begun cropping up. When asked if Pei may have had to start from scratch, he said this was the case. With an “encouraging grin” Robert Kennedy simply wished Mr. Pei “Good luck.”&lt;ref name=&quot;HuxtableDec12-64&quot; /&gt;

Mrs. Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. &quot;He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,&quot; she said. &quot;He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it &quot;really an emotional decision&quot;, she explained: &quot;He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wiseman, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long before Pei was selected, the $10 million goal set by Black had been reached.&lt;ref name=&quot;HuxtableDec12-64&quot; /&gt; By 1965, fundraising was suspended when the contributions reached $20 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymont&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Years of setbacks===
In January 1966, when [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[John A. Volpe]] signed a bill allowing the state to purchase the land for the site — an old train yard belonging to the [[Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority]] (MBTA) — it was expected that the project would be complete by 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Samuelson&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The MBTA would not agree to remove the heavy machinery from the land until 1970.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only now could Pei prepare a six-month study of the site’s soil, and he said the &quot;money we had six years ago, today will barely pay for 60 percent of the original plans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymont-RisingCosts&quot; /&gt;

Robert Kennedy, by then a senator from New York, had been serving as president of the John F. Kennedy Library Corporation until he was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated in 1968]]. Weeks before, [[William Manchester]] and [[Harper &amp; Row]] donated $750,000 to the library.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymont-Manchester&quot;&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first in a series of installments expected to total $5 million, came from the profits of the book ''[[The Death of a President]]'' which caused a bitter feud between the Kennedys and Manchester.

By 1971, construction had still not begun; researchers and scholars were forced to work out of the Federal Records Center which was temporarily housing some of the 15 million documents and manuscripts. Pei said there was finally &quot;a clear way ahead&quot;; however, he was asked to save on construction expenses by using inexpensive materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymont&quot; /&gt; This would translate into Pei working with concrete instead of his preferred stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;WGBH&quot;&gt;{{cite video

On May 22, 1971, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who succeeded Kennedy as president, saw the dedication of the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] in [[Austin, Texas]]. On the campus of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and next to the [[LBJ School of Public Affairs]], he would beat the Kennedy team to building the first Presidential Library that also served as a place of scholarly research. He would not live to see work begin on his predecessor's.

Meanwhile, the Cambridge community was in fierce opposition to having the library being built in Cambridge at all. Although originally welcomed in 1965, the library was now seen as a great attractor of over a million annual tourists who would change the neighborhood with &quot;hordes of tourists, automobiles, fast-food franchises and souvenir shops,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KifnerBlockedby&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The new location of the site was [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]] in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, near the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]], described as a group of &quot;massive, blocky structures...in sharp contrast to the mellow and urbane atmosphere of the library’s original site near Harvard Square.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberger&quot;&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was originally a [[garbage dump]], Pei recalls finding old refrigerators and appliances under the soil. In all seriousness, he asserted that one could toss a lit match on the earth and watch the ground ignite as the soil emitted [[methane gas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WGBH&quot; /&gt; One thing the site did have going for it was that the community was not opposed to the area being [[landscaped]] to house the library.

June 12, 1977 marked the official [[groundbreaking ceremony|groundbreaking]] for the library with construction following in August. Although the site was a landfill it did overlook Boston, [[Dorchester Bay (Boston Harbor)|Dorchester Bay]] and the [[Atlantic ocean|ocean]]. The area was covered in {{convert|15|ft|m}} of earth and [[topsoil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jfkl.org-Pei&quot; /&gt; Pei was particularly proud of the landscaping results.&lt;ref name=&quot;WGBH&quot; /&gt;

The design would be a simple geometric structure with a large glass pavilion. The concrete tower stands {{convert|125|ft|m}} tall and houses offices and archives. A circular section contains two theaters and is connected to the tower by the {{convert|115|foot|m}} grey-glass pavilion.

===Dedication===
The official dedication was held on October 20, 1979. Outside the building on [[lawn|the green]], on a blue-carpeted stage with a bank of yellow [[chrysanthemum]]s sat the Kennedy family and those close to them. Among many others, President [[Jimmy Carter]] was in their company. The ceremony began with President Kennedy’s daughter, [[Caroline Kennedy]], introducing her brother, [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]], who read from the [[Stephen Spender]] poem, ''I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great''.

President Carter said of John F. Kennedy that he embodied “the ideals of a generation as few public figures have ever done in the history of the earth.”&lt;ref name=&quot;TerranceSmith&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. &quot;I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,&quot; he said in 2000. &quot;It could and should have been a great project.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vb56&quot;&gt;von Boehm, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most important consequence of the Kennedy project for Pei was his elevation in the public's consciousness as an architect of note.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Pei considered the John F. Kennedy Library &quot;the most important commission in my life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vb56&quot;/&gt;

Kennedy's 25-foot [[Wianno Senior]] [[sailboat]] ''Victura'' is on display on the grounds of the Library from May to October.  Acquired by the family when Kennedy was 15, it played an important role in forging sibling bonds and, after the president's death, continued being sailed by other members of the family, especially race-enthusiast brother [[Ted Kennedy|Ted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=James|title=Victura: the Kennedys, a Sailboat, and the Sea|date=April 1, 2014|publisher=ForeEdge/University Press of New England|location=Lebanon, NH|isbn=978-1-61168-411-7|pages=3–10|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Visit/Plan-Your-Trip.aspx Plan Your Trip], John F.

===Audiovisual===
The audiovisual archives contain over 400,000 still photographs taken from 1863–1984, over 7.5 million feet (2.29×[[one million|10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;]] m) of film shot between 1910–83, and 11,000 reels of audio recordings from 1910–85.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfkl.org-AV&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Oral-history project===
Begun in 1964, the oral-history project was a unique undertaking to document and preserve interviews with those associated with Kennedy. Initially expected to have about 150 participants,&lt;ref name=&quot;LewisMarch&quot; /&gt; today it contains over 1,100 interviews and continues to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfkl.org-oral-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Because the interviewees are allowed to review their transcripts before the interviews are released for use by scholars, the audio may differ from the written record; so that the interviewing may disambiguate any misunderstanding in their speech and make it clear in a written form.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfkl.org-oral-history&quot; /&gt;

===Artifacts===
The library keeps a wide range of artifacts, many of which can be found in their respective exhibits. One is the original coconut on which a rescue message was inscribed by Kennedy to rescue the crew of the ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]'', and which was delivered by [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]], natives of the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jfkl.org-coconut&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==The Ernest Hemingway Collection==
The library is also home to a collection of documents and belongings from [[Ernest Hemingway]].  The collection was established in 1968 following an exchange of letters between [[Mary Welsh Hemingway|Hemingway's widow Mary]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] that confirmed that Hemingway's papers would be archived there.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehchist&quot;&gt;{{cite web
