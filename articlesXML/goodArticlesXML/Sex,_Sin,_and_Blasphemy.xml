'''''Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy: A Guide to America's Censorship Wars''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by lawyer and [[civil liberties|civil libertarian]] [[Marjorie Heins]], about [[freedom of speech]] and the [[censorship]] of works of art in the early 1990s by the U.S. government. The book was published in 1993 by [[The New Press]]. Heins provides an overview of the history of censorship, including the 1873 [[Comstock laws]], before moving on to more topical case studies of attempts at suppression of free expression.

The book argues that artists have been [[scapegoat]]ed by those advocating censorship, as a method of deflecting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene has been used as a tactic throughout history to suppress [[women's rights]]. Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of [[pornography]], [[hip hop music]], and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent.

''Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy'' received a favorable reception from the ''Women's Review of Books'', which praised the author's clear writing style and ability to present complex legal information in an understandable format for the reader. The book received additional positive reviews from ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]'', ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', and ''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]''. ''[[American Book Review]]'' criticized the author for arguing for an absolute right to free speech in virtually all circumstances.

==Content summary==
[[File:Anthony Comstock.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Comstock]] (circa 1913)]]
''Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy'' provides the reader with a history of censorship of artworks.&lt;ref name=&quot;twardy&quot; /&gt; The book argues that artists have been [[scapegoat]]ed by those advocating censorship, as a method of diverting debate away from the suppression of human rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;twardy&quot; /&gt; The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene has been used as a tactic throughout history to suppress [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;twardy&quot; /&gt; Heins describes for the reader the history of the 1873 [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref name=&quot;victorgreto&quot; /&gt; Such laws were put forth by [[United States Postal Inspection Service]] inspector [[Anthony Comstock]], and after he helped influence passage of the legislation, they enabled the government to criminalize sending perceived immoral writings through the mail.&lt;ref name=&quot;massing&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Children and the demons of pop culture|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Michael|last=Massing|authorlink=Michael Massing|date=August 25, 2001|page=B9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book discusses the history of the division of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) that assigns movie ratings, the Classification and Rating Administration. Heins quotes New York Supreme Court Judge Charles Ramos, who observed that film directors have since learned to style their movies in such a way as to receive certain ratings from the MPAA.&lt;ref name=&quot;patriciaholt&quot; /&gt;

Heins recounts how the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) advocated for its associated organizations to add [[Parental Advisory]] warnings on labels of music albums as a way to advise parents about possible offensive content. She describes how the [[Parents Music Resource Center]], co-founded by [[Tipper Gore]], and hearings held by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, which included Senator [[Al Gore]], led to attempts at censorship by lawmakers in eight individual states. Heins suggests that this subsequently led to the industry's self-regulation, which the author sees as [[self-censorship]], and blacklisting of certain albums by music stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;patriciaholt&quot; /&gt;

''Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy'' provides the reader with what the author (and many others) consider case studies of censorship in the U.S., including a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] against naked erotic dancing, laws against pornography in the 1980s supported by proponents [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]], and attempts by the [[Meese Report|Meese Commission]] to discourage proprietors from selling ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' and ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;patriciaholt&quot; /&gt;

Formally known as the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, it was colloquially called the Meese Report, because the people on the Commission were selected by then-Attorney General of the United States [[Edwin Meese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;merzer&quot;&gt;{{cite news|page=1A|title=Censorship on rising tide across U.S.A. words and thoughts under greater attack|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|location=Florida|date=September 25, 1986|author1=Martin Merzer|author2=Itabari Njeri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in 1986, the Meese Report demanded U.S. citizens protest pornography because of its asserted harmful impact to women and children.&lt;ref name=&quot;merzer&quot; /&gt; The book criticizes controversy generated by politicians against the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], over the organization's support of photography by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and the work, &quot;[[Piss Christ]]&quot;, by [[Andres Serrano]].&lt;ref name=&quot;victorgreto&quot; /&gt;

Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of [[pornography]], [[hip hop music]], and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;patriciaholt&quot; /&gt; She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=T is for Trouble where smutty T-shirts are concerned|work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=June 7, 1997|first=Roy|last=Rivenburg|agency=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=1|publisher=Star-Telegram, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author concludes, &quot;A free society is based on the principle that [individuals have] a right to decide on what art or entertainment (they want) to receive&amp;nbsp;– or create.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;patriciaholt&quot; /&gt;

==Reception==
''Women's Review of Books'' commented, &quot;Heins writes with intelligence, clarity, humor and refusal of cant. She is especially skilled at explaining legal concepts, reminding us of the elegance of a good legal argument.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nanlevinson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Review: Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy|last=Levinson|first= Nan|journal=Women's Review of Books|date= April 1994|volume= 11|page=1|issn=0738-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review found that by focusing on lawsuits and court battles, the book was lacking in individual stories and people central to the censorship fights.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanlevinson&quot; /&gt; ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]'' wrote, &quot;The book is as much a call to action as it is a catalog of repression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;twardy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The News &amp; Observer]]|first=Chuck|last=Twardy|title=Fighting the foes of free speech&amp;nbsp;– When it comes to arts censorship education is&amp;nbsp;– just as important as litigation.|date=May 31, 1993|page=C1|publisher=The News &amp; Observer Pub. Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its review of the book, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' emphasized that readers should pay attention to the author's warnings about the dangers of censorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;patriciaholt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Patricia|last=Holt|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title=Protection or Censorship?|date=July 4, 1993|page=2; Section: Sunday Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]'' observed, &quot;Throughout the book, whether discussing attempts to censor rap music or pornography, Heins attempts to communicate the radical differences between the limits of American law and America's seemingly endless social problems. She concludes that they do not and cannot mix. The best defense, it would seem, to any form of speech that offends, is a good offense: more speech, not restrictive and oppressive laws and pressures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;victorgreto&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]|date=July 4, 1993|title=Amendment under microscope&amp;nbsp;– Issue of censorship forces closer look at intent|first=Victor|last=Greto|page=4|location=Colorado Springs, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[American Book Review]]'' was critical, writing: &quot;Overall, Heins's guide to the censorship wars is biased and woefully superficial ... I do not find her arguments for free-speech absolutism either logically or legally compelling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;paulatrout&quot; /&gt; The review concluded, &quot;There may be good reasons for tolerating the public display of gross and disgusting art, but the First Amendment itself does not provide one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;paulatrout&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Review: Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy|journal=[[American Book Review]]|last=Trout|first= Paul A.|date=October–November 1994|volume=16|page= 28|issn=0149-9408}}&lt;/ref&gt;
