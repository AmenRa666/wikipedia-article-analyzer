'''''My Story''''' (or '''''Mon histoire''''') is a tell-all memoir by Canadian Julie Couillard. It was first written in French, then during summer 2008, translated into English. Both versions were published across Canada in October 2008.

Couillard first appeared in the national media when she dated the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Maxime Bernier]]. The [[Maxime Bernier#Couillard affair / Cabinet resignation|Bernier-Couillard Affair]] erupted in May 2008 over confidential, NATO-related documents left at Couillard's house. Media coverage, and Bernier's reaction, left Couillard feeling victimized. To help dispel rumours regarding her life and her role with Bernier, Couillard signed a book deal.

In her book, she recounts her early years, describes her relationship with Bernier, and reveals his confidential opinions.

Intended to be released on October 14, 2008, the book's release date was moved forward when that same day was selected for the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|Canadian federal election]]. Bernier dismissed the embarrassing allegations against him in her book as ridiculous.  Though ''My Story'' was released eight&amp;nbsp;days prior to the election, Bernier nonetheless was re-elected in his district of [[Beauce (electoral district)|Beauce]]. The English version peaked at #6 on ''[[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]]'''s bestseller list while the French version reached #5. Critics found Couillard's story self-righteous and sometimes conveniently vague, but noted that it provided a unique view into the government's inner circle.

==Background==
Julie Couillard began dating [[Conservative Party of Canada]] Member of Parliament, [[Maxime Bernier]], in April 2007. The media started covering her in August, when she wore a revealing dress to Bernier's swearing-in ceremony for his new position as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nelson |last=Wyatt |title=Couillard doesn't hold back in new book: Publisher |work=[[Canadian Online Explorer]] |agency=[[The Canadian Press]] |date=September 9, 2008 |url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/CanadaVotes/News/2008/09/09/6712366-cp.html |accessdate=October 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912041646/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/CanadaVotes/News/2008/09/09/6712366-cp.html |archivedate=September 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had first met at a restaurant-dinner with business associates.&lt;ref name=Blatchford&gt;{{cite news

Their relationship became the subject of a [[List of Canadian political scandals|political scandal]] which brought about intense media attention.

==Bernier-Couillard affair==
Bernier was elected as a Conservative [[star candidate]] in Quebec and became the [[Minister of Industry (Canada)|Minister of Industry]] before being reassigned to the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in August 2007. Though his relationship with Couillard had ended in December, they continued with occasional trysts.&lt;ref name=Geddes&gt;{{cite journal

He asked Couillard to destroy them. Couillard, on the other hand, put the notes aside and forgot about them until May when she returned the notes to a foreign affairs office. Significant discussion about the affair was then voiced in both the [[Canadian House of Commons]] and the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Content==
The book begins as an [[autobiography]]. Couillard was born in the late-1960s in the Montreal district of [[Ville-Émard]]; then she moved to the suburb of [[Lorraine, Quebec|Lorraine]] when she was 4. Her parents often fought as her mother believed that her husband was unfaithful; the family incurred financial problems when Couillard's father changed careers. At age 12, Couillard was diagnosed with epilepsy. At age 17, she bought several properties with a boyfriend. They lived together briefly before breaking up and selling the properties. Couillard then became a friend, then lover, of Gilles Giguère, a money lender who was associated with the controversial, motorcycle club, [[Hells Angels]]. In 1996, after the police raided Giguère's apartment and (according to Couillard) threatened him, Giguère became sullen and withdrawn: the police had charged him with conspiracy to commit murder. But two&amp;nbsp;months later, they let the charge drop.  Giguère was soon murdered.&lt;ref name=Gillis&gt;{{cite web

In 1997, Couillard met Stéphane Sirois, a reputed ''enforcer'' and drug dealer, member of the [[Outlaw motorcycle club|Rockers]] a Hells Angels affiliate club. They married. However, financial problems interfered with their relationship; furthermore, Couillard had cheated on Sirois with a man named Bruno. During their divorce, Sirois became an informant for the police and entered a [[witness protection]] program. Couillard then became pregnant with Bruno's child, and had an abortion; they subsequently separated. Following further personal, financial problems, Couillard declared bankruptcy in 2002. She then began an affair with a married man who abandoned her while they visited [[Venice, Italy]]. When she returned to Canada, Couillard launched a security firm, Integrated Global Solutions, along with an auto-leasing business. Meanwhile, she began to date Bernard Coté, an aide to federal [[Minister of Public Works and Government Services (Canada)|Minister of Public Works]], [[Michael Fortier]].  Couillard then introduced Coté to Philippe Morin of the Kevlar Group, a real estate company which signed a deal with the federal government to acquire land from Kevlar. When the deal became public Coté's involvement was considered a conflict of interest and Fortier, responsible for the actions of his staff, was forced to resign, despite Morin denying any connection between Kevlar and Couillard.&lt;ref name=Gillis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivison/&gt;

Then, in April 2007, while attending a [[Conservative Party of Canada]] fundraising affair, Couillard was asked to consider being a candidate for the party. Later, she attended a dinner where she met [[Maxime Bernier]]; they began dating. Bernier registered Couillard as his designated traveling companion with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order for Couillard to accompany Bernier on government business.

In her book, Couillard characterizes Bernier as intellectually lazy, preoccupied with his appearance, and as concerned that he appears gay. She writes further that Bernier privately criticized Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]'s eating habits and his physique. She adds that Bernier spoke with party supporters about replacing Harper as the party leader, and says that Bernier opposed the invasion of Iraq contrary to his party's stance.  Further revelations regarding Bernier include that he whispered negative comments to Couillard about members of his [[Electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]]; and that he did not own a laptop, yet frequently used her house and home computer as a second office.

Couillard goes on to describe the NATO document incident and the ensuing media coverage from her perspective.&lt;ref name=Gillis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whyte&gt;{{cite journal
