{{Infobox mercury}}
'''Mercury''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Hg''' and [[atomic number]] 80. It is commonly known as '''quicksilver''' and was formerly named '''hydrargyrum''' ({{IPAc-en|h|aɪ|ˈ|d|r|ɑr|dʒ|ər|ə|m}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hydrargyrum &quot;hydrargyrum&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy]], silvery [[d-block]] element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is [[bromine]], though metals such as [[caesium]],&lt;!--Fr is not completely certain--&gt; [[gallium]], and [[rubidium]] melt just above [[room temperature]].

Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as [[cinnabar]] ([[mercuric sulfide]]). The red pigment [[vermilion]] is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or synthetic mercuric sulfide.

Mercury is used in [[thermometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[manometer]]s, [[sphygmomanometer]]s, [[float valve]]s, [[mercury switch]]es, [[mercury relay]]s, [[fluorescent lamp]]s and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as [[alcohol]]- or [[galinstan]]-filled glass thermometers and [[thermistor]]- or [[Infrared thermometer|infrared]]-based electronic instruments.  Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] for [[dental restoration]] in some locales. It is used in [[fluorescent lighting]]. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave [[ultraviolet light]] which then causes the phosphor in the tube to [[fluoresce]], making visible light.

[[Mercury poisoning]] can result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as [[mercuric chloride]] or [[methylmercury]]), by inhalation of mercury vapor, or by ingesting any form of mercury.

==Properties==

===Physical properties===
[[File:Pound-coin-floating-in-mercury.jpg|thumb|left|A [[One pound (British decimal coin)|pound coin]] (density ~7.6 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) floats in mercury due to the combination of the [[buoyant force]] and [[surface tension]].]]
Mercury is a heavy, silvery-white liquid metal. Compared to other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond, C. R [http://www-d0.fnal.gov/hardware/cal/lvps_info/engineering/elements.pdf The Elements] in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coefficient of volume expansion is 181.59 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&amp;nbsp;°C, 181.71 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 182.50 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; at 100&amp;nbsp;°C (per °C). Solid mercury is malleable and ductile and can be cut with a knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simons, E. N.|title=Guide to Uncommon Metals|date= 1968|publisher=Frederick Muller|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves deep into the realm of [[quantum physics]], but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique [[electron configuration]] where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s [[Electron shell#Subshells|subshell]]s. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to [[noble gas]]es, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.

The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the [[nuclear charge]] that increases the attractive [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb interaction]] of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see [[lanthanide contraction]]). The absence of a filled inner ''f'' shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of [[cadmium]] and [[zinc]], although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.&lt;!--On the other hand, [[gold]], which is one space to the left of mercury on the periodic table, has atoms with one fewer 6s electron than mercury. Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong [[metallic bonds]].--&gt;&lt;ref name=Senese1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norrby&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Norrby, L.J.|title=Why is mercury liquid? Or, why do relativistic effects not get into chemistry textbooks?| journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume=68|issue=2|page=110 |date=1991|doi=10.1021/ed068p110|bibcode=1991JChEd..68..110N|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed068p110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Mercury does not react with most acids, such as dilute [[sulfuric acid]], although [[oxidizing acid]]s such as concentrated sulfuric acid and [[nitric acid]] or [[aqua regia]] dissolve it to give [[Mercuric sulfate|sulfate]], [[Mercury(II) nitrate|nitrate]], and [[Mercury(II) chloride|chloride]]. Like silver, mercury reacts with atmospheric [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Mercury reacts with solid sulfur flakes, which are used in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury (spill kits also use [[activated carbon]] and powdered zinc).&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt;

====Amalgams====
[[File:Mercury discharge tube.jpg|thumb|left|Mercury-discharge spectral calibration lamp]]
Mercury dissolves many other metals such as gold and silver to form [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams]]. Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have traditionally been used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals with the exception of [[manganese]], [[copper]] and [[zinc]] are reluctant to form amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include [[platinum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gmelin, Leopold |title=Hand book of chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AI5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=30 December 2012|date=1852|publisher=Cavendish Society|pages=103 (Na), 110 (W), 122 (Zn), 128 (Fe), 247 (Au), 338 (Pt)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Soratur|title=Essentials of Dental Materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6HbxyaSt78C&amp;pg=PT14|date= 2002|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|isbn=978-81-7179-989-3|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sodium amalgam]] is a common reducing agent in [[organic synthesis]], and is also used in [[high-pressure sodium]] lamps.

Mercury readily combines with [[aluminium]] to form a [[aluminium amalgam|mercury-aluminium amalgam]] when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the [[aluminium oxide]] layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron [[rust]]ing), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrAl&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author =Vargel, C. |author2 =Jacques, M. |author3 =Schmidt, M. P.| title = Corrosion of Aluminium|date =2004| isbn = 9780080444956|publisher = Elsevier |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NAABS5KrVDYC&amp;pg=PA158|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[liquid metal embrittlement#Mercury embrittlement|Mercury embrittlement]] is the most common type of liquid metal embrittlement.

===Isotopes===
{{Main article|Isotopes of mercury}}
There are seven stable [[isotope]]s of mercury with {{chem|202|Hg}} being the most abundant (29.86%). The longest-lived [[radioisotope]]s are {{chem|194|Hg}} with a [[half-life]] of 444 years, and {{chem|203|Hg}} with a half-life of 46.612 days. Most of the remaining radioisotopes have half-lives that are less than a day. {{chem|199|Hg}} and {{chem|201|Hg}} are the most often studied [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]]-active nuclei, having spins of {{frac|2}} and {{frac|3|2}} respectively.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

==Etymology==
Hg is the modern [[chemical symbol]] for mercury. It comes from ''hydrargyrum'', a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ὑδράργυρος (''hydrargyros''), which is a compound word meaning &quot;water-silver&quot; (from ὑδρ- ''hydr-'', the root of ὕδωρ, &quot;water,&quot; and ἄργυρος ''argyros'' &quot;silver&quot;) – since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver. The element was named after the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], known for his speed and mobility. It is associated with the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the [[alchemical symbol]]s for the metal; the Sanskrit word for alchemy is ''[[Rasavātam]]'' which means &quot;the way of mercury&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ykEN2zHvCpQC&amp;pg=PA260|page=260|title=The Pillar of Celestial Fire|author=Cox, R|publisher=1st World Publishing|date= 1997|isbn=1-887472-30-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stillman&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mercury symbol.svg|thumb|left|120px|The symbol for [[Mercury (planet)|the planet Mercury]] (☿) has been used since ancient times to represent the element]]
Mercury was found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs that date from 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury and the environment — Basic facts|publisher=[[Environment Canada]], Federal Government of Canada| date=2004|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/mercure-mercury/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=9A4397AD-1|accessdate=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]] and [[Tibet]], mercury use was thought to prolong life, heal fractures, and maintain generally good health, although it is now known that exposure to mercury vapor leads to serious adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury — Element of the ancients|publisher=Center for Environmental Health Sciences, [[Dartmouth College]]| url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~toxmetal/mercury/history.html|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first emperor of China, [[Qin Shi Huang|Qín Shǐ Huáng Dì]]—allegedly buried in a [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|tomb]] that contained rivers of flowing mercury on a model of the land he ruled, representative of the rivers of China—was killed by drinking a mercury and powdered [[jade]] mixture formulated by [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] alchemists (causing [[liver failure]], [[mercury poisoning]], and [[brain death]]) who intended to give him eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qin Shihuang|publisher=Ministry of Culture, [[People's Republic of China]]| date=2003|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_22854.htm|accessdate=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wright&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of China|date=2001|author=Wright, David Curtis|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-30940-X|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]], the second [[Tulunid]] ruler of Egypt (r. 884–896), known for his extravagance and profligacy, reportedly built a basin filled with mercury, on which he would lie on top of air-filled cushions and be rocked to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Khumārawaih | first = Moritz | last = Sobernheim | encyclopedia = E.J.

In November 2014 &quot;large quantities&quot; of mercury were discovered in a chamber 60 feet below the 1800-year-old pyramid known as the &quot;[[Temple of the Feathered Serpent]],&quot; &quot;the third largest pyramid of [[Teotihuacan]],&quot; Mexico along with &quot;jade statues, jaguar remains, a box filled with carved shells and rubber balls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/24/liquid-mercury-mexican-pyramid-teotihuacan|title=Liquid mercury found under Mexican pyramid could lead to king's tomb|last=Yuhas|first=Alan|date=2015-04-24|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] used mercury in ointments; the [[ancient Egyptians]] and the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] used it in [[cosmetics]]. In [[Lamanai]], once a major city of the [[Maya civilization]], a pool of mercury was found under a marker in a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Pendergast|first = David M.|title = Ancient maya mercury|journal = Science|volume = 217|pages = 533–535|date = 6 August 1982|bibcode = 1982Sci...217..533P |doi = 10.1126/science.217.4559.533|issue = 4559|pmid = 17820542}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lamanai|url = http://www.guidetobelize.info/en/maya/belize-mayan-lamanai-guide.shtml |accessdate = 17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 500 BC mercury was used to make [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams]] (Medieval Latin ''amalgama'', &quot;alloy of mercury&quot;) with other metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DIWEi5Hg93gC&amp;pg=PA120|page=120|title=Jewelrymaking through history|author=Hesse R W|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date= 2007|isbn=0-313-33507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alchemy|Alchemists]] thought of mercury as the [[Prima materia|First Matter]] from which all metals were formed. They believed that different [[metals]] could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of [[sulfur]] contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the [[Chrysopoeia|transmutation]] of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stillman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = Story of Alchemy and Early Chemistry|author = Stillman, J.

The mines in [[Almadén]] (Spain), [[Monte Amiata]] (Italy), and [[Idrija]] (now Slovenia) dominated mercury production from the opening of the mine in Almadén 2500 years ago, until new deposits were found at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;MercHz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title =Mercury hazards to living organisms|author= Eisler, R.| publisher = CRC Press|date = 2006|isbn = 978-0-8493-9212-2|url = https://books.google.com/?id=gqc8wUvsI8cC&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercury is an extremely rare element in Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 0.08 parts per million (ppm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GerdDmwMTLkC&amp;pg=PA265|page=265|title=Geomicrobiology|author=Ehrlich, H. L.|author2=Newman D. K.|publisher=CRC Press| date=2008|isbn=978-0-8493-7906-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it does not blend [[geochemistry|geochemically]] with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in [[cinnabar]], [[corderoite]], [[livingstonite]] and other [[mineral]]s, with cinnabar (HgS) being the most common ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s00254-002-0629-5|title=Mercury from mineral deposits and potential environmental impact |journal=Environmental Geology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=326–338|author=Rytuba, James J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury ores usually occur in very young [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]] where rocks of high density are forced to the crust of Earth, often in hot springs or other [[volcano|volcanic]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 July 2009|title=Mercury Recycling in the United States in 2000|publisher=USGS|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1196u/Circ_1196_U.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1558, with the invention of the [[patio process]] to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in [[New Spain]] and [[Peru]]. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burkholder, M.|author2=Johnson, L.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Colonial Latin America|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 2008|pages=157–159|isbn=0-19-504542-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of [[Huancavelica]], Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later [[pan amalgamation]] process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a4hPCX2XWDIC&amp;pg=PA33|page=33|title=Domestic Architecture and Power|author=Jamieson, R W|publisher=Springer|date=2000|isbn=0-306-46176-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury-27128.jpg|thumb|Native mercury with [[cinnabar]], Socrates mine, [[Sonoma County, California]]. Cinnabar sometimes alters to native mercury in the oxidized zone of mercury deposits.]]

Former mines in Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once produced a large proportion of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia ([[Idrija]]) and Spain ([[Almadén]]), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. [[Nevada]]'s [[McDermitt, Nevada-Oregon|McDermitt]] Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46&amp;nbsp;kg) flask.&lt;ref name=&quot;brooks_usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/mercury/mercumcs07.pdf|format=PDF|title=Mercury|author=Brooks, W. E.|date=2007|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor. The equation for this extraction is
:HgS + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Hg + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Mineral Production|date= May 2001|publisher= British Geological Survey, NERC|location= London|year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper [[electrowinning]] processes and by recovery from effluents.

Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://act.credoaction.com/campaign/thanks_mercury/?rc=fb_share1 About the Mercury Rule]. Act.credoaction.com (21 December 2011). Retrieved on 30 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, prison labor was used by a private mining company as recently as the 1950s to create new cinnabar mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels.&lt;ref name=&quot;GREEN&quot;/&gt; Worker health in functioning mines is at high risk.

The [[European Union]] directive calling for compact [[fluorescent bulbs]] to be made mandatory by 2012 has encouraged China to re-open cinnabar mines to obtain the mercury required for CFL bulb manufacture. Environmental dangers have been a concern, particularly in the southern cities of [[Foshan]] and [[Guangzhou]], and in [[Guizhou]] province in the southwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Sheridan, M. |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6211261.ece |title='Green' Lightbulbs Poison Workers: hundreds of factory staff are being made ill by mercury used in bulbs destined for the West|date=3 May 2009|publisher=The Sunday Times (of London, UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abandoned mercury mine processing sites often contain very hazardous waste piles of roasted cinnabar [[calcine]]s. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use. For example, in 1976 [[Santa Clara County, California]] purchased the historic [[Almaden Quicksilver County Park|Almaden Quicksilver Mine]] and created a county park on the site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C6N03Lww1YsC&amp;pg=PA8|page=8|title=New Almaden|author=Boulland M|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|date= 2006|isbn=0-7385-3131-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{See also|Category:Mercury compounds}}
Mercury exists in two main oxidation states, I and II.

===Compounds of mercury(I)===
Unlike its lighter neighbors, cadmium and zinc, mercury usually forms simple stable compounds with metal-metal bonds. Most mercury(I) compounds are [[diamagnetic]] and feature the dimeric cation, Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}}. Stable derivatives include the chloride and nitrate. Treatment of Hg(I) compounds complexation with strong ligands such as sulfide, cyanide, etc. induces disproportionation to {{chem|Hg|2+}} and elemental mercury.&lt;ref name=&quot;henderson&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = Main group chemistry| author = Henderson, W.|location=Great Britain| publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry|date = 2000| isbn = 0-85404-617-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twdXz1jfVOsC&amp;pg=PA162|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercury(I) chloride]], a colorless solid also known as [[calomel]], is really the compound with the formula Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with the connectivity Cl-Hg-Hg-Cl. It is a standard in electrochemistry. It reacts with chlorine to give mercuric chloride, which resists further oxidation. [[Mercury(I) hydride]], a colorless gas, has the  formula HgH, containing no Hg-Hg bond.

Indicative of its tendency to bond to itself, mercury forms [[mercury polycations]], which consist of linear chains of mercury centers, capped with a positive charge. One example is {{chem|Hg|3|2+|(AsF|6|-|)}}{{su|b=2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Brown | first1 = I. D.| last2 = Gillespie | first2 = R. J.| last3 = Morgan | first3 = K.

===Compounds of mercury(II)===
Mercury(II) is the most common oxidation state and is the main one in nature as well. All four mercuric halides are known. They form tetrahedral complexes with other ligands but the halides adopt linear coordination geometry, somewhat like Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; does. Best known is [[mercury(II) chloride]], an easily [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimating]] white solid. HgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forms [[coordination complex]]es that are typically tetrahedral, e.g. {{chem|HgCl|4|2-}}.

[[Mercury(II) oxide]], the main [[oxide]] of mercury, arises when the metal is exposed to air for long periods at elevated temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400&amp;nbsp;°C, as was demonstrated by [[Joseph Priestley]] in an early synthesis of pure [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.

Being a [[HSAB|soft metal]], mercury forms very stable derivatives with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is [[mercury(II) sulfide]], HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar and is the brilliant pigment [[vermilion|vermillion]]. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two [[Polymorphism (materials science)|forms]], the reddish cubic form and the black [[zinc blende]] form.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; [[Mercury(II) selenide]] (HgSe) and [[mercury(II) telluride]] (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. [[mercury cadmium telluride]] and [[mercury zinc telluride]] being [[semiconductors]] useful as [[infrared detector]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4b3WLgomvd0C&amp;pg=PA507|page=507|title=Infrared detectors|author=Rogalski, A|publisher=CRC Press|date=2000|isbn=90-5699-203-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercury(II) salts form a variety of complex derivatives with [[ammonia]]. These include Millon's base (Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the one-dimensional polymer (salts of {{chem|HgNH|2|+}}){{su|b=n}}), and &quot;fusible white precipitate&quot; or [Hg(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Known as [[Nessler's reagent]], [[potassium tetraiodomercurate(II)]] ({{chem|HgI|4|2-}}) is still occasionally used to test for ammonia owing to its tendency to form the deeply colored iodide salt of Millon's base.

[[Mercury(II) fulminate|Mercury fulminate]] is a [[detonator]] widely used in [[explosive]]s.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

===Possibility of higher oxidation states===
Oxidation states above +2 in a non-charged species are extremely rare, although a cyclic mercurinium(IV) cation, with three substituents, may be an intermediate in oxymercuration reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bamford, C.H. |author2=Compton, R.G. |author3=Tipper, C.F.H. |title=Addition and Elimination Reactions of Aliphatic Compounds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJevSztje7IC&amp;pg=PA49|date=1973|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-41051-1|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carey, Francis A.|author2=Sundberg, Richard J.|last-author-amp=yes |title=Advanced Organic Chemistry: Part A: Structure and Mechanisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5dYyJMBhCoC&amp;pg=PA517|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-44897-8|pages=517–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a report of synthesis of a mercury(IV) compound, [[mercury(IV) fluoride]], was published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Xuefang | last = Wang | first2 = Lester | last2 = Andrews | first3 = Sebastian | last3 = Riedel | first4 = Martin | last4 = Kaupp | title = Mercury Is a Transition Metal: The First Experimental Evidence for HgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Angew.

===Organomercury compounds===
{{Main article|Organomercury compound}}
Organic mercury [[chemical compound|compounds]] are historically important but are of little industrial value in the western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organomercury compounds are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike [[organocadmium]] and [[organozinc]] compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is [[aryl]] or [[alkyl]] and X is usually halide or acetate. [[Methylmercury]], a generic term for compounds with the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in [[pollution|polluted]] water.&lt;ref name=&quot;methylHg&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=BPvWJbBMd7wC|title = Toxicological effects of methylmercury|author = National Research Council (U.S.) – Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology| publisher = National Academies Press|date = 2000|isbn = 978-0-309-07140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They arise by a process known as [[biomethylation]].

==Applications==
[[File:Maximum thermometer close up 2.JPG|thumb|right|The bulb of a [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]]]]
Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in [[fluorescent lamps]], while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive [[Galinstan]] [[alloy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00216-005-0069-7|date=November 2005|author=Surmann, P|author2=Zeyat, H|title=Voltammetric analysis using a self-renewable non-mercury electrode|volume=383|issue=6|pages=1009–13|pmid=16228199|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
[[File:Amalgam.jpg|thumb|right|Amalgam filling]]

{{see also|Amalgam (dentistry)}}
Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood. The first edition of the Merck's Manual featured many mercuric compounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merck's Manual 1899|edition=First|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41697|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as:

Mercury is an ingredient in [[amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgams]]. [[Thiomersal]] (called ''Thimerosal'' in the United States) is an [[organic compound]] used as a [[preservative]] in [[vaccine]]s, though this use is in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = FDA|url = http://www.fda.gov/Cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm|title = Thimerosal in Vaccines|accessdate=25 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiomersal is metabolized to [[ethyl mercury]]. Although it was [[Thiomersal controversy|widely speculated]] that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger [[autism]] in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |date=2004 |volume=114 |title= Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autistic spectrum disorder: a critical review of published original data |author= Parker SK |author2= Schwartz B |author3= Todd J |author4= Pickering LK |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-0434 |pmid=15342856|issue=3 |pages=793–804}} [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/1/200 Erratum] (2005).

Another mercury compound, [[merbromin]] (Mercurochrome), is a topical antiseptic used for minor cuts and scrapes that is still in use in some countries.

Mercury in the form of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various traditional medicines, especially in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in [[overdose]], or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible. Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms, its use in traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been justified, as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liu J |author2= Shi JZ |author3=Yu LM |author4=Goyer RA |author5=Waalkes MP |title=Mercury in traditional medicines: is cinnabar toxicologically similar to common mercurials? |journal=Exp.

Today, the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. [[Mercury-in-glass thermometer|Thermometers]] and [[sphygmomanometer]]s containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively. In the early 21st century, their use is declining and has been banned in some countries, states and medical institutions. In 2002, the [[U.S. Senate]] passed legislation to phase out the sale of [[Medical prescription|non-prescription]] mercury thermometers. In 2003, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Maine]] became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahanews.com/ahanews_app/jsp/display.jsp?dcrpath=AHA/NewsStory_Article/data/ann_030602_mercuryban&amp;domain=AHANEWS|title=Two States Pass First-time Bans on Mercury Blood Pressure Devices|date=2 June 2003|publisher=Health Care Without Harm|accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury compounds are found in some [[over-the-counter drug]]s, including topical [[antiseptics]], stimulant laxatives, [[diaper rash|diaper-rash]] [[ointment]], [[eye drops]], and [[nasal spray]]s. The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] has &quot;inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness&quot; of the mercury ingredients in these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=310.545&amp;SearchTerm=mercury| title=Title 21—Food and Drugs Chapter I—Food and Drug Administration Department of Health and Human Services Subchapter D—Drugs for Human Use Code of federal regulations|publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury is still used in some diuretics although substitutes now exist for most therapeutic uses.

===Production of chlorine and caustic soda===
[[Chlorine]] is produced from [[sodium chloride]] (common salt, NaCl) using [[electrolysis]] to separate the metallic [[sodium]] from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such [[chloralkali process]] are hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or [[lye]]. By far the largest use of mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The CRB Commodity Yearbook (annual)|date= 2000|page=173|issn=1076-2906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USEPA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/pubs/600r02104/600r02104chap3.pdf|format=PDF|author=Leopold, B.

===Laboratory uses===
Some [[Mercury-in-glass thermometer|medical thermometers]], especially those for high temperatures, are filled with mercury; they are gradually disappearing. In the United States, non-prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers has been banned since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Mercury Reduction Act of 2003|url = http://openlibrary.org/b/OL17617678M|accessdate = 6 June 2009| publisher = United States.

Mercury is also found in [[liquid mirror telescopes]].

Some [[Meridian circle#Structure|transit telescopes]] use a basin of mercury to form a flat and absolutely horizontal mirror, useful in determining an absolute vertical or perpendicular reference.  Concave horizontal parabolic mirrors may be formed by rotating liquid mercury on a disk, the parabolic form of the liquid thus formed reflecting and focusing incident light. Such telescopes are cheaper than conventional large mirror telescopes by up to a factor of 100, but the mirror cannot be tilted and always points straight up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030818233315/http://www.govertschilling.nl/artikelen/science/030314_sc.htm|url=http://www.govertschilling.nl/artikelen/science/030314_sc.htm|title=Liquid-mirror telescope set to give stargazing a new spin|date=14 March 2003|archivedate=18 August 2003|publisher=Govert Schilling|accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Gibson, B.

===Niche uses===
Gaseous mercury is used in [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s and some &quot;[[neon sign]]&quot; type advertising signs and [[fluorescent lamp]]s. Those low-pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in [[optical spectroscopy]] for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; reflecting a fluorescent ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = A guide to the use and calibration of detector array equipment| author = Hopkinson, G.

* In [[Islamic Spain]], it was used for filling decorative pools. Later, the American artist [[Alexander Calder]] built a [[mercury fountain]] for the Spanish Pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 World Exhibition in Paris]]. The fountain is now on display at the [[Fundació Joan Miró]] in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pgUfSrD4gzQC&amp;pg=PA10|page=10|title=Mercury|author=Lew K|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|date= 2008|isbn=1-4042-1780-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mercury was used inside [[wobbler (fishing)|wobbler]] lures. Its heavy, liquid form made it useful since the lures made an attractive irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug. Such use was stopped due to environmental concerns, but illegal preparation of modern fishing plugs has occurred.
* The [[Fresnel lens]]es of old [[lighthouses]] used to float and rotate in a bath of mercury which acted like a bearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oY8nG-6B6v0C&amp;pg=PA29|page=29|title=Lighthouses|publisher=Osprey Publishing|date= 2003|isbn=0-7478-0556-3|author=Pearson L F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mercury [[sphygmomanometer]]s (blood pressure meter), [[barometer]]s, [[diffusion pump]]s, [[Mercury coulometer|coulometers]], and many other laboratory instruments.

Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] steam plants in later years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FigDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|title=Cheaper Power from Quicksilver|author=Mueller, Grover C. |date=September 1929|publisher=Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/POWER/mercury/mercury.htm|date=13 November 2008|work=Museum of Retro Technology|title=Mercury as a Working Fluid}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similarly, liquid mercury was used as a [[coolant]] for some [[nuclear reactor]]s; however, [[sodium]] is proposed for reactors cooled with liquid metal, because the high density of mercury requires much more energy to circulate as coolant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2KYVftKE9NUC&amp;pg=PA64|page=64|title=Introduction to Nuclear Power|author=Collier|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=1987|isbn=1-56032-682-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mercury was a propellant for early [[ion engines]] in [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric space propulsion]] systems. Advantages were mercury's high molecular weight, low ionization energy, low dual-ionization energy, high liquid density and liquid storability at [[room temperature]]. Disadvantages were concerns regarding environmental impact associated with ground testing and concerns about eventual cooling and condensation of some of the propellant on the spacecraft in long-duration operations. The first spaceflight to use electric propulsion was a mercury-fueled ion thruster developed by [[NASA Glenn Research Center|NASA Lewis]] and flown on the Space Electric Rocket Test &quot;[[SERT-1]]&quot; spacecraft launched by [[NASA]] at its [[Wallops Flight Facility]] in 1964. The SERT-1 flight was followed up by the SERT-2 flight in 1970. Mercury and [[caesium]] were preferred propellants for ion engines until [[Hughes Research Laboratory]] performed studies finding [[xenon]] gas to be a suitable replacement. Xenon is now the preferred propellant for ion engines as it has a high molecular weight, little or no reactivity due to its [[noble gas]] nature, and has a high liquid density under mild cryogenic storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/ds1.html|title=Glenn Contributions to Deep Space 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/electricprop.html|title=Electric space propulsion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others applications made use of the chemical properties of mercury:
* The [[mercury battery]] is a non-rechargeable [[electrochemical battery]], a [[primary cell]], that was common in the middle of the 20th century. It was used in a wide variety of applications and was available in various sizes, particularly button sizes. Its constant voltage output and long shelf life gave it a niche use for camera light meters and hearing aids. The mercury cell was effectively banned in most countries in the 1990s due to concerns about the mercury contaminating landfills.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMERC Mercury Use in Batteries&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=IMERC Fact Sheet: Mercury Use in Batteries| url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/batteries.cfm| publisher=Northeast Waste Management Officials' Association |accessdate=20 June 2013| date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mercury was used for preserving wood, developing [[daguerreotype]]s, [[silvering]] [[mirror]]s, [[anti-fouling paint]]s (discontinued in 1990), [[herbicide]]s (discontinued in 1995), handheld maze games, cleaning, and road leveling devices in cars. Mercury compounds have been used in [[antiseptic]]s, laxatives, [[antidepressant]]s, and in [[syphilis|antisyphilitics]].
* It was allegedly used by [[Western Allies|allied spies]] to sabotage Luftwaffe planes: a mercury paste was applied to bare [[aluminium]], causing the metal to rapidly [[Corrosion|corrode]]; this would cause structural failures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Gray, T.| title=The Amazing Rusting Aluminum|publisher =[[Popular Science]]| date =22 September 2004|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-09/amazing-rusting-aluminum|accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chloralkali process]]: The largest industrial use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the [[anode]] of the [[Castner-Kellner process]]. The chlorine was used for bleaching paper (hence the location of many of these plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage has largely been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19171026|title=Mercury from Chlor-alkali plants|journal= Environmental Health |date=2009|volume= 8|url=http://tankdc.com/getdoc/c21877bc-357a-4f46-980f-988e85d00a54/Article_51-10_Autism,_Mercury_and_High_Fructose_Co.aspx|doi=10.1186/1476-069X-8-2|last1=Dufault|first1=Renee|last2=Leblanc|first2=Blaise|last3=Schnoll|first3=Roseanne|last4=Cornett|first4=Charles|last5=Schweitzer|first5=Laura|last6=Wallinga|first6=David|last7=Hightower|first7=Jane|last8=Patrick|first8=Lyn|last9=Lukiw|first9=Walter J|page=2|pmc=2637263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* From the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries, a process called &quot;[[carroting]]&quot; was used in the making of [[felt]] hats. Animal skins were rinsed in an orange solution (the term &quot;carroting&quot; arose from this color) of the mercury compound [[mercuric nitrate]], Hg(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Inorganic Chemistry|author=Lee, J.D.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|date=1999|isbn=978-0-632-05293-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process separated the fur from the pelt and matted it together. This solution and the vapors it produced were highly toxic. The [[United States Public Health Service]] banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in December 1941. The psychological symptoms associated with mercury poisoning inspired the phrase &quot;[[mad as a hatter]]&quot;. [[Lewis Carroll]]'s &quot;[[Mad Hatter]]&quot; in his book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' was a play on words based on the older phrase, but the character himself does not exhibit symptoms of mercury poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |date=1983 |volume=287 |page=1961 |title= Did the Mad Hatter have mercury poisoning? |author= Waldron, HA |pmid=6418283 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.287.6409.1961 |issue= 6409 |pmc= 1550196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--http://www.jstor.org/pss/139669--&gt;
* Gold and silver mining. Historically, mercury was used extensively in [[hydraulic mining|hydraulic gold mining]] in order to help the gold to sink through the flowing water-gravel mixture. Thin gold particles may form mercury-gold amalgam and therefore increase the gold recovery rates.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Large-scale use of mercury stopped in the 1960s. However, mercury is still used in small scale, often clandestine, gold prospecting. It is estimated that 45,000 metric tons of mercury used in California for [[placer mining]] have not been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3014/ |title=Mercury Contamination from Historical Gold Mining in California |accessdate=26 February 2008 |author=Alpers, C.

====Historic medicinal uses====
Mercury(I) chloride (also known as calomel or mercurous chloride) has been used in [[traditional medicine]] as a [[diuretic]], topical [[disinfectant]], and [[laxative]]. [[Mercury(II) chloride]] (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat [[syphilis]] (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pimple, K.D.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants.

==Toxicity and safety==
{{See also|Mercury poisoning|Mercury cycle}}
Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain [[mercury-in-glass thermometer|thermometers]] or [[fluorescent light bulb]]s), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mercury/spills/index.htm|title=Mercury: Spills, Disposal and Site Cleanup|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=11 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an [[eyedropper]], or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine [[sulfur]], [[zinc]], or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.

Mercury can be absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and mercury vapors can be inhaled, so containers of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation. Heating of mercury, or of compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated, should be carried out with adequate ventilation in order to minimize exposure to mercury vapor. The most toxic forms of mercury are its [[organic compounds]], such as [[dimethylmercury]] and [[methylmercury]].  Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning.

===Releases in the environment===
[[File:Mercury in Ice Core Upper Fremont Glacier.svg|thumb|right|Amount of atmospheric mercury deposited at Wyoming's Upper Fremont Glacier over the last 270 years]]

Preindustrial deposition rates of mercury from the atmosphere may be about 4&amp;nbsp;ng /(1 L of ice deposit). Although that can be considered a natural level of exposure, regional or global sources have significant effects. Volcanic eruptions can increase the atmospheric source by 4–6 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-051-02/|title=Glacial Ice Cores Reveal A Record of Natural and Anthropogenic Atmospheric Mercury Deposition for the Last 270 Years|publisher=United States Geological Survey (USGS)|accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural sources, such as [[volcano]]es, are responsible for approximately half of atmospheric mercury emissions. The human-generated half can be divided into the following estimated percentages:&lt;ref name=Pacyna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mercury/|title=What is EPA doing about mercury air emissions?|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/176/ |title=Winged Mercury and the Golden Calf|author=Solnit, R.|date=September–October 2006|publisher=Orion Magazine|accessdate=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 65% from stationary combustion, of which [[coal-fired power plant]]s are the largest aggregate source (40% of U.S. mercury emissions in 1999). This includes power plants fueled with gas where the mercury has not been removed. Emissions from coal combustion are between one and two orders of magnitude higher than emissions from oil combustion, depending on the country.&lt;ref name=Pacyna/&gt;
* 11% from gold production. The three largest point sources for mercury emissions in the U.S. are the three largest gold mines. Hydrogeochemical release of mercury from gold-mine tailings has been accounted as a significant source of atmospheric mercury in eastern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es048962j|title=Determination of Mercury Evasion in a Contaminated Headwater Stream|date=2005|last1=Maprani|first1=Antu C.|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=39|issue=6|page=1679|last2=Al|first2=Tom A.|last3=MacQuarrie|first3=Kerry T.|last4=Dalziel|first4=John A.|last5=Shaw|first5=Sean A.|last6=Yeats|first6=Phillip A.|bibcode = 2005EnST...39.1679M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6.8% from [[non-ferrous metal]] production, typically [[smelter]]s.
* 6.4% from [[cement]] production.
* 3.0% from [[waste disposal]], including [[municipal waste|municipal]] and [[hazardous waste]], [[crematoria]], and [[sewage sludge]] incineration.
* 3.0% from [[caustic soda]] production.
* 1.4% from [[pig iron]] and [[steel]] production.
* 1.1% from mercury production, mainly for batteries.
* 2.0% from other sources.
The above percentages are estimates of the global human-caused mercury emissions in 2000, excluding biomass burning, an important source in some regions.&lt;ref name=Pacyna&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Atmos Environ |date=2006 |volume=40 |issue=22 |page=4048|title= Global anthropogenic mercury emission inventory for 2000 |author= Pacyna E G |author2= Pacyna J M |author3= Steenhuisen F |author4= Wilson S |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.03.041|bibcode = 2006AtmEn..40.4048P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent atmospheric mercury contamination in outdoor urban air was measured at 0.01–0.02&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. A 2001 study measured mercury levels in 12 indoor sites chosen to represent a cross-section of building types, locations and ages in the New York area. This study found mercury concentrations significantly elevated over outdoor concentrations, at a range of 0.0065 – 0.523 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The average was 0.069 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/MercuryIndoor.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2009|title=Indoor Air Mercury|date=May 2003|work=newmoa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercury also enters into the environment through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/reduce/epr/products/mercury.htm|title=Mercury-containing Products|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to health concerns (see below), [[waste management|toxics use reduction]] efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/thermostats.pdf IMERC Fact Sheet – Mercury Use in Thermostats].
newmoa.org. January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Most thermometers now use pigmented [[alcohol]] instead of mercury, and [[galinstan]] alloy thermometers are also an option. Mercury thermometers are still occasionally used in the medical field because they are more accurate than alcohol thermometers, though both are commonly being replaced by electronic thermometers and less commonly by galinstan thermometers. Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.

Historically, one of the largest releases was from the Colex plant, a lithium-isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plant operated in the 1950s and 1960s. Records are incomplete and unclear, but government commissions have estimated that some two million pounds of mercury are unaccounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[United States Department of Energy]]|title = Introduction|url = http://www.hss.energy.gov/healthsafety/ohre/new/findingaids/epidemiologic/oakridge1/intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A serious [[industrial disasters|industrial disaster]] was the dumping of mercury compounds into [[Minamata]] Bay, Japan. It is estimated that over 3,000 people suffered various deformities, severe mercury poisoning symptoms or death from what became known as [[Minamata disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/hs/minamata2002/|title=Minamata Disease The History and Measures|publisher=Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan|accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dennis Normile | title = In Minamata, Mercury Still Divides | journal = Science | volume = 341 | page = 1446 | date = 27 September 2013 | doi=10.1126/science.341.6153.1446|bibcode = 2013Sci...341.1446N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational exposure===
Due to the health effects of mercury exposure, industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries. The [[World Health Organization]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], and [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] all treat mercury as an occupational hazard, and have established specific occupational exposure limits. Environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].

====Effects and symptoms of mercury poisoning====
{{Main article|Mercury poisoning}}
Toxic effects include damage to the brain, kidneys and lungs. Mercury poisoning can result in several diseases, including [[acrodynia]] (pink disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome, and [[Minamata disease]].

Symptoms typically include sensory impairment (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation and a lack of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. [[Case control studies]] have shown effects such as tremors, impaired [[cognitive]] skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ngim&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chronic neurobehavioral effects of elemental mercury in dentists|pmid=1463679|journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=49|issue=11| date=1992|author1=Ngim, CH|author2=Foo, SC|author3=Boey, K.W.|author4=Keyaratnam, J|pmc=1039326|pages=782–90|doi=10.1136/oem.49.11.782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;liang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Psychological effects of low exposure to mercury vapor: Application of computer-administered neurobehavioral evaluation system|journal=Environmental Research|volume=60| doi=10.1006/enrs.1993.1040|date=1993|pmid=8472661|last1=Liang|first1=YX|last2=Sun|first2=RK|last3=Sun|first3=Y|last4=Chen|first4=ZQ|last5=Li|first5=LH|issue=2|bibcode = 1993ER.....60..320L|pages=320–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; resulted in chest pain, [[dyspnea]], cough, [[hemoptysis]], impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial [[pneumonitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McFarland, RB|author2=Reigel, H|last-author-amp=yes|journal=J.

Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including [[erethism]], irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{EHC-ref | id = 001 | name = Mercury | date = 1976 | isbn = 92-4-154061-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EHC-ref | id = 118 | name = Inorganic mercury | date = 1991 | isbn = 92-4-157118-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Research on the treatment of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-[[penicillamine]] (NAP), [[British Anti-Lewisite]] (BAL), [[2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid]] (DMPS), and [[dimercaptosuccinic acid]] (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bluhm, RE |journal=Hum Exp Toxicol |date=1992 |volume=11|issue=3|title=Elemental Mercury Vapour Toxicity, Treatment, and Prognosis After Acute, Intensive Exposure in Chloralkali Plant Workers.

===Fish===
{{Main article|Mercury in fish}}
[[Fish]] and [[shellfish]] have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often in the form of [[methylmercury]], a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the [[food chain]], such as [[shark]], [[swordfish]], [[king mackerel]], [[bluefin tuna]], [[albacore tuna]], and [[tilefish]] contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the [[viscera]], although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cocoros | first1 = G. | last2 = Cahn | first2 = P. H. | last3 = Siler | first3 = W. | title = Mercury concentrations in fish, plankton and water from three Western Atlantic estuaries | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8649.1973.tb04500.x | url = http://www.feedmethefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cocoros_and_cahn_19731.pdf| journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 641–647 | year = 1973 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the [[food chain]] amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called [[biomagnification]]. [[Mercury poisoning]] happened this way in [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]], [[Japan]], now called [[Minamata disease]].

==Regulations==

===International===
140 countries agreed in the [[Minamata Convention on Mercury]] by the [[United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP) to prevent emissions.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/newscentre/Default.aspx?DocumentID=2702&amp;ArticleID=9373&amp;l=en |title=Minamata Convention Agreed by Nations
|publisher=[[United Nations Environment Program]]|accessdate= 19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention was signed on the 10th of October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43963&amp;Cr=mercury&amp;Cr1=#.UPt4ikfdP5M|title=UN News - Governments at UN forum agree on legally-binding treaty to curb mercury pollution|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2013-01-19|website=UN News Service Section|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] is charged with regulating and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]], and the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]]. Additionally, the [[Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act]], passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa regs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mercury/regs.htm|title=Mercury: Laws and regulations|date=16 April 2008|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijc.org/php/publications/html/12br/english/report/chemical/rme.html |title=Reductions in Mercury Emissons|publisher=[[International Joint Commission]] on the [[Great Lakes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Clean Air Act (1990)|Clean Air Act]], passed in 1990, put mercury on a list of toxic pollutants that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/mercuryrule/|title=Clean Air Mercury Rule|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national [[emissions trading|cap and trade]] system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;nj vs epa&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200802/05-1097a.pdf |title=State of New Jersey et al., Petitioners vs. Environmental Protection Agency (Case No. 05-1097)|publisher=United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Argued 6 December 2007, Decided 8 February 2008|accessdate= 30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the Clean Air Act had its intended impact.&lt;ref&gt;Mark S. Castro, John Sherwell, ''Effectiveness of Emission Controls to Reduce the Atmospheric Concentrations of Mercury''. In: ''[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]'' 49, 2015, 14000−14007, {{DOI|10.1021/acs.est.5b03576}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA announced new rules for coal-fired power plants on 22 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2011/12/22/oldest-dirtiest-power-plants-told-clean/mORfVS1jUOOlXuTPIRQKbL/story.html|title=Oldest, dirtiest power plants told to clean up|date=22 December 2011|newspaper=Boston Globe|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cement kilns that burn hazardous waste are held to a looser standard than are standard [[hazardous waste]] [[incinerator]]s in the United States, and as a result are a disproportionate source of mercury pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/11/10/142183546/epa-regulations-give-kilns-permission-to-pollute|title=EPA Regulations Give Kilns Permission To Pollute|author=Howard Berkes|agency=NPR|date=10 November 2011|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In the [[European Union]], the directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]]) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits the amount of mercury in other products to less than 1000 [[Parts per million|ppm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eu regs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:037:0019:0023:EN:PDF |title=Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment|date=27 January 2003 }} Article 4 Paragraph 1. e.g. &quot;Member States shall ensure that, from July 1, 2006, new electrical and electronic equipment put on the market does not contain lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, [[lead]], [[hexavalent chromium]] and [[cadmium]]) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eiatrack.org/s/1785|title=Mercury compounds in European Union: |date=2007|publisher=EIA Track|accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.

===Norway===
[[Norway]] enacted a total ban on the use of mercury in the manufacturing and import/export of mercury products, effective 1 January 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;norway&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1198237627.85|title=Norway to ban mercury|date=21 December 2007|publisher=EU Business|accessdate=30 May 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080121173517/http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1198237627.85 |archivedate = 21 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, several lakes in Norway were found to have a poor state of mercury pollution, with an excess of 1&amp;nbsp;µg/g of mercury in their sediment.&lt;ref name=&quot;environment norway&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2005.09.059|date=2006|title=Atmospheric mercury in Norway: contributions from different sources|volume=368|issue=1|pages=3–9|pmid=16310836|journal=The Science of the total environment|author1=Berg, T|author2=Fjeld, E|author3=Steinnes, E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Norway’s Minister of Environment Development Erik Solheim said: “Mercury is among the most dangerous environmental toxins. Satisfactory alternatives to Hg in products are
available, and it is therefore fitting to induce a ban.” &lt;ref name=&quot;fda.gov&quot;&gt;Edlich, Richard F.; Rhoads, Samantha K.;  Cantrell, Holly S.; Azavedo, Sabrina M. and Newkirk, Anthony T.

US FDA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Products containing mercury were banned in Sweden in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828040807/http://www.thelocal.se/20090114/16892|title=Sweden to ban mercury - The Local|last=|first=|date=14 January 2009|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828101154/http://www.thelocal.se/20120421/40396|title=Sweden may be forced to lift ban on mercury - The Local|last=|first=|date=21 April 2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In 2008, Denmark also banned dental mercury amalgam,&lt;ref name=&quot;fda.gov&quot;/&gt; except for molar masticating surface fillings in permanent (adult) teeth.
