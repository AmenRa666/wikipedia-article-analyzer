'''Mauricio González-Gordon y Díez, Marquis of Bonanza''' (18 October 1923 – 27 September 2013) was a Spanish [[sherry]] maker and a conservationist. Most of his life he worked for the family company, [[González Byass]], where he increased its exports to a worldwide level. His family estate was located in the wetland region called Doñana in southern Spain and was threatened by drainage efforts in the early 1950s. González-Gordon with the help of researchers and international support managed to preserve the site, while at the same time donating some of his family land to the conservation effort. Afterward, González-Gordon became one of the founders of the [[Spanish Ornithological Society]] in 1954. His conservation efforts for Doñana culminated in the creation of the [[Doñana National Park]] in 1969. The area was designated a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1994.

==Early years==
González-Gordon was born in [[Hampton Hill]], London, United Kingdom, as a son to a Spanish family with Scottish descent rooted in the [[Clan Gordon]]. His parents were Manuel María González-Gordon and Emilia Díez Gutiérrez. Mauricio, whose father was known as the 'Pope of Sherry', was the second of a total of four children.&lt;ref name=diariojerez/&gt; One of his ancestors, John David Gordon of Wardhouse, had moved to [[Jerez de la Frontera]] in the 18th century and started trading in sherry.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article3894474.ece |title=Mauricio González-Gordon y Diez |work=The Times |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his birth, González-Gordon's father Manuel was the chairman of [[González Byass]] and was actively promoting the brand in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; During his youth González-Gordon was raised as a bilingual, being fluent in both Spanish and English. González-Gordon moved to Jerez de la Frontera at age three to go to school in Spain.&lt;ref name=elpais&gt;{{cite web|author=Ana Huguet |url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2013/09/28/lacrisis/1380322480_654228.html |title=Mauricio González-Gordon, el embajador del jerez | language=Spanish |work=El País |date=28 September 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was homeschooled by private tutors and attended La Salle Buen Pastor college.&lt;ref name=diariojerez/&gt;&lt;ref name=scotsman&gt;{{cite web|author=Phil Davison |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-mauricio-gonzalez-gordon-sherry-producer-and-environmentalist-1-3149185 |title=Obituary: Mauricio González-Gordon, sherry producer and environmentalist |work=The Scotsman |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended the [[:es:Instituto Padre Luis Coloma|Instituto Padre Luis Coloma]].&lt;ref name=diariojerez/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcdesevilla.es/andalucia/cadiz/20130927/sevi-fallece-mauricio-gonzalez-gordon-201309271352.html |title=Fallece el bodeguero jerezano Mauricio González-Gordon y Díez |language=Spanish |work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His primary studies were followed up by economic studies at the Jerez College of Commerce, where he licensed as a teacher of trade.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; He passed the final period of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1939 working in an airplane factory, helping construct [[Polikarpov]] planes for the aerial forces of General [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref name=diariojerez/&gt; He attended the [[University of Seville]] and graduated in Chemical Sciences in 1946.&lt;ref name=diariojerez/&gt;

==González Byass==
González-Gordon worked most of his life for the family company [[González Byass]], which specializes in making [[sherry]]. He was the fifth generation of the family to chair the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DI, Drinks International|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxotAQAAMAAJ|page=88|year=2008|publisher=Practical Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working for the firm he was involved in the making, tasting and commercialisation of sherry and in later years he also helped the company expand into producing brandy and several sorts of wine.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|author=Phil Davison |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/bf4047e6-2b99-11e3-a1b7-00144feab7de.html#axzz2jrA2kSTm |title=Aristocrat who oversaw sherry's renaissance |work=Financial Times |date=4 October 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after he finished his studies in 1946 he joined the business and started at the bottom with the picking and crushing of grapes. During this time he also learned about the [[solera]] system, which is used to age different type of liquids.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt; His interest in [[oenology]] had only developed after visiting California the year he graduated.&lt;ref name=elpais/&gt; He visited California after previously being sent to New York by boat with twelve containers of wine.&lt;ref name=diariojerez/&gt; In 1955 he founded the first research center for [[viticulture]] and [[winemaking]] in Spain by establishing one at González Byass. For twenty years he was occupied as head of wine selection at the company. González-Gordon also served on the board of González Byass beginning in 1961, and was president of the company between 1993 and 1999.&lt;ref name=decanter&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Jane Evans MW |url=http://www.decanter.com/news/wine-news/584411/obituary-gentleman-of-sherry-mauricio-gonzalez-gordon-y-diez-dies |title=Obituary: 'Gentleman of Sherry' Mauricio Gonzalez-Gordon y Diez dies |publisher=Decanter.com |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period González-Gordon managed to expand the business by exporting all over the world, including to the United States, United Kingdom, China and East Asia. After his time as president he continued to serve as an advisor to his son, Mauricio Junior, who took over his position.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt; Apart from his work at González Byass González-Gordon also diverted some of his time towards the regulatory council of the sherry making industry, serving for 24 years.&lt;ref name=decanter/&gt;&lt;ref name=drinksbus/&gt;

==Conservationism==
[[File:Wetlands in Donana.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Wetlands in Doñana]]
González-Gordon was involved with conservationism from an early age; he was also an avid bird watcher and would become an [[ornithologist]].&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt; His family estate was located in the Coto Doñana, a wetland at the mouth of the river [[Guadalquivir]], near Jerez de la Frontera, in southern Spain. Here González-Gordon became interested in the local ecosystem and invited European ornithologists to visit the area. When two Spanish ornithologists, Professor [[Francisco Bernis]] and [[José Antonio Valverde]] visited, González-Gordon served as their guide. The González-Gordon family saw that the wetlands were threatened by the planting of eucalyptus trees and large-scale drainage plans proposed by the government. Mauricio, together with his father, asked Bernis to try and influence Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] into abandoning these proposals.&lt;ref name=seo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/europe-and-central-asia/news/co-founder-seobirdlife-and-saviour-do%C3%B1ana-dies-aged-89 |title=Co-founder of SEO/BirdLife and saviour of Doñana dies aged 89 |publisher=BirdLife |date=2 October 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio wrote a memorandum which was presented to Franco himself by Mauricio's father Manuel.&lt;ref name=&quot;González2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis Mariano González|title=El águila imperial ibérica: el resurgir de una especie amenazada| language=Spanish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qap5axpOZ-4C&amp;pg=PA133|year=2012|publisher=Fundacion BBVA|isbn=978-84-92937-38-7|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1953, Bernis had finished a report on the value of the Doñana, which showed that the area had exceptional ecological value. The group sought international support for their goals and found it. The efforts of González-Gordon to dissuade Franco exposed him to some danger,&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt; but the Franco government conceded and the drainage plans were aborted.&lt;ref name=seo/&gt;

By 1963 an international organisation founded with the goal of protecting Doñana had purchased {{convert|7000|ha}} in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nash2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Nash|title=Seville, Cordoba, and Granada : A Cultural History: A Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GC-Nu86-9LcC&amp;pg=PA167|date=16 September 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972537-3|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning their fight against the construction plans González-Gordon, Bernis and Valverde wished to create a Spanish foundation for ornithology. The idea to start the organisation had already come up in their first meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valverde2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=José A. Valverde|title=Memorias de un biólogo heterodoxo |language=Spanish |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKpZ-QMYdnIC&amp;pg=PA184|year=2003|publisher=Editorial CSIC – CSIC Press|isbn=978-84-87610-10-3|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1954 they founded the [[Spanish Ornithological Society]] (SEO) in Madrid, which currently is the Spanish affiliate of [[BirdLife International]]. The trio had written the founding statutes among themselves. The organisation was supported by visits to Doñana of famous ornithologists as [[Edward Max Nicholson]] and [[Julian Huxley]], with González-Gordon guiding them around.&lt;ref name=seo/&gt; He would also serve as chair of the board of SEO between 1966 and 1968. The Doñana area was turned into [[Doñana National Park]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=seo/&gt; The González-Gordon family ceded much of its land between [[Bonanza, Spain|Bonanza]] and [[Matalascañas]] for the creation of the national park.&lt;ref name=elpais/&gt; In 1994 the area was turned into an [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] and currently measures {{convert|543|km²}}. The park has a wide range of ecosystems and is especially important for migratory birds. González-Gordon also wrote a translation of [[Roger Tory Peterson]]'s ''[[Peterson Field Guides|A Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe]]'' in 1957.&lt;ref name=seo/&gt;

==Personal life==
González-Gordon has been described as being proud of his Scottish heritage, which centred on the town of [[Huntly]] and the [[Clan Gordon]].&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt; His personal clothing style reflected this; he was noted for his tweed jackets and British clothes in general.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name=elpais/&gt; He had been married to Milagro López de Carrizosa y Eizaguirre for 62 years before she died in July 2013. The couple had two children, Bibiana and Mauricio, with Mauricio being the current president of the family company.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt; During the three final years of his life González-Gordon was in poor health and could hardly leave his home.&lt;ref name=elpais/&gt; He died on 27 September 2013 in his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera at the age of 89. His family claims that the last thing he drank was a [[Tío Pepe]], the most famous brand of the family business.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt; His death occurred at the Asisa clinic where he had spent his last couple of weeks. The memorial service was held at the San Juan Bautista de La Salle church on 28 September.&lt;ref name=diariojerez&gt;{{cite web|author=J.P.S. |url=http://www.diariodejerez.es/article/jerez/1611692/muere/mauricio/gonzalezgordon/y/diez.html |title='Goodbye' al último 'señor del sherry' |publisher=Diario de Jerez |date=28 September 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his work at González Byass and his conservation efforts at Doñana he was also president of the local [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] organisation in Jerez de la Frontera, serving as its president for thirteen years, between 1974 and 1988.&lt;ref name=decanter/&gt;&lt;ref name=drinksbus&gt;{{cite web|author=Gabriel Savage |url=http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2013/09/mauricio-gonzalez-gordon-1923-2013/ |title=Mauricio González-Gordon: 1923–2013 |publisher=The Drinks Business |date=30 September 2013 |accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
