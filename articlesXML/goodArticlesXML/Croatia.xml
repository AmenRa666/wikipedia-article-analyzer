'''Croatia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Croatia.ogg|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə}} {{respell|kroh|AY|shə}}; {{lang-hr|Hrvatska}} {{IPA-sh|xř̩ʋaːtskaː|}}), officially the '''Republic of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Republika Hrvatska|links=no}}, {{Audio|Hr-Republika Hrvatska.oga|listen}}), is a [[sovereign state]] between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Its capital city is [[Zagreb]], which forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with its [[Counties of Croatia|twenty counties]]. Croatia covers {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and has diverse, mostly [[Continental climate|continental]] and [[Mediterranean climate]]s. Croatia's [[Adriatic Sea]] coast contains [[List of islands of Croatia|more than a thousand islands]]. The country's population is 4.28&amp;nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Croats]], with the most common religious denomination being [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].

The Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD. They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of Kings [[Petar Krešimir IV of Croatia|Petar Krešimir IV]] and [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Dmitar Zvonimir]]. Croatia entered a [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of the [[House of Habsburg]] to the Croatian throne. In 1918, after [[World War I]], Croatia was included in the unrecognized [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] which seceded from [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The [[Independent State of Croatia|fascist Croatian puppet state]] backed by  Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany existed during [[World War II]]. After the war, Croatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], a constitutionally [[socialist state]]. On 25 June 1991 Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully during the four years following the declaration.

A [[unitary state]], Croatia is a republic governed under a [[parliamentary system]]. The [[International Monetary Fund]] classified Croatia as an emerging and developing economy, and the [[World Bank]] identified it as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]]. Croatia is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), United Nations (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[International Security Assistance Force|NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] for the 2008–2009 term.

The [[service sector]] dominates Croatia's economy, followed by the [[industrial sector]] and agriculture. [[Tourism in Croatia|Tourism]] is a significant source of revenue during the summer, with Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. The European Union is Croatia's most important [[international trade|trading partner]]. Since 2000, the Croatian government constantly invests in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]]. Internal sources produce a significant portion of [[energy in Croatia]]; the rest is imported. Croatia provides a [[universal health care]] system and free [[Education in Croatia|primary and secondary education]], while supporting [[Culture of Croatia|culture]] through numerous public institutions and corporate investments in [[Media of Croatia|media]] and [[Croatian literature|publishing]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Greda i zabat s natpisom kneza Branimira 879.jpg|thumb|left|[[Branimir Inscription]] is the oldest preserved monument containing an inscription defining a Croatian medieval ruler as a duke of Croats]]
The [[name of Croatia]] derives from [[Medieval Latin]] ''Croātia'' – compare ''DUX CRUATORVM'' {{sic}} (&quot;Duke of the Croats&quot;) attested in the [[Branimir inscription]] – itself a derivation of [[North-West Slavic]] ''*Xrovat-'', by [[liquid metathesis]] from proposed [[Common Slavic]] period ''*Xorvat-'', from proposed [[Proto-Slavic]] ''*Xarwāt-'' (''*Xъrvatъ'') or ''*Xŭrvatŭ'' (''*xъrvatъ'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Gluhak-1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Alemko Gluhak|title=Hrvatski etimološki rječnik|trans_title=Croatian Etymological Dictionary|language=Croatian|publisher=August Cesarec|year=1993|isbn=953-162-000-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the name is uncertain, but is thought to be a [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] term assigned to a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic tribe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KU-Greenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite web| publisher=[[University of Kansas]]| author= Marc L. Greenberg| title= The Role of Language in the Creation of Identity: Myths in Linguistics among the Peoples of the Former Yugoslavia| url= http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/969/1/yugoslav_myths96.pdf| format= PDF|date=April 1996| accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest preserved record of the Croatian [[ethnonym]] *xъrvatъ is of variable stem, attested in the [[Baška tablet]] in [[Style (manner of address)|style]] ''zvъnъmirъ kralъ xrъvatъskъ'' (&quot;[[Dmitar Zvonimir|Zvonimir]], Croatian king&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fučić-1971&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=21348 |first=Branko | last = Fučić | authorlink = Branko Fučić |title=Najstariji hrvatski glagoljski natpisi| trans_title= The Oldest Croatian Glagolitic Inscriptions |journal=[[Slovo (journal)|Slovo]] |publisher=[[Old Church Slavonic Institute]] |volume=21 |date=September 1971 |language=Croatian| pages=227–254| accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attestation of the Latin term is attributed to a charter of Duke [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir]] from the year 852. The original is lost, and just a 1568 copy is preserved—leading to doubts over the authenticity of the claim.{{sfn|Mužić|2007|p=27}} The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription (found near [[Benkovac]]), where Duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]] is styled as ''Dux Cruatorvm''. The [[inscription]] is not believed to be dated accurately, but is likely to be from during the period of 879-892, during Branimir's rule.{{sfn|Mužić|2007|pp=195–198}}

The [[ethnogenesis]] of Croats is uncertain and there are several competing theories, ''Slavic'' and ''Iranian'' being the most frequently put forward. The most widely accepted of these, the ''Slavic'' theory, proposes migration of [[White Croats]] from the territory of [[White Croatia]] during the [[Migration Period]]. Conversely, the ''Iranian'' theory proposes [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin, based on [[Tanais Tablets]] containing [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription of given names ''Χορούαθ[ος]'', ''Χοροάθος'' and ''Χορόαθος'' (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as [[anthroponym]]s of Croatian people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikšić-Heršak&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Migracijske i etničke teme|issn= 1333-2546|publisher=Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies|date=September 2007|volume=23|issue=3|pages=251–268|author1=Emil Heršak|author2=Boris Nikšić|language=Croatian|title=Hrvatska etnogeneza: pregled komponentnih etapa i interpretacija (s naglaskom na euroazijske/nomadske sadržaje)|trans_title=Croatian Ethnogenesis: A Review of Component Stages and Interpretations (with Emphasis on Eurasian/Nomadic Elements) | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=28729&amp;lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habsburg Monarchy and Austria-Hungary (1538–1918)===
{{Main|Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatian–Ottoman Wars|Austria-Hungary}}
[[File:Austria-Hungary map.svg|thumb|right| The [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] (no. 17) was a nominally autonomous kingdom within [[Austria-Hungary]] created in 1868 following the [[Croatian-Hungarian Settlement]]]]
[[File:Ivan Zasche, Portret bana Josipa Jelacica.jpg|thumb|upleft|left|180px|Ban [[Josip Jelačić]] fought [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarians in 1848 and 1849]]]]

Following the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories, with the partition formed in 1538. The military territories would become known as the [[Croatian Military Frontier]] and were under direct Imperial control. Ottoman advances in the Croatian territory continued until the 1593 [[Battle of Sisak]], the first decisive Ottoman defeat, and stabilisation of borders.{{sfn|Frucht|2005|pp=422–423}}

During the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683–1698), [[Slavonia]] was regained but western [[Bosnia]], which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control.{{sfn|Frucht|2005|pp=422–423}} The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. [[Dalmatia]], the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|Fifth]] and the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718)|Seventh Ottoman–Venetian War]]s.{{sfn|Lane|1973|p=409}}

The [[Croatian–Ottoman Wars|Ottoman wars]] instigated great demographic changes. Croats migrated towards [[Austria]] and the present-day [[Burgenland Croats]] are direct descendants of these settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Cultural Association in Burgenland|url=http://www.hkd.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=102&amp;lang=hr|language=Croatian|title=Povijest Gradišćanskih Hrvatov|trans_title=History of Burgenland Croats|accessdate=17 October 2011|archivedate=26 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69Qku2uNT}}&lt;/ref&gt; To replace the fleeing population, the Habsburgs encouraged the Christian populations of Bosnia and [[Serbia]] to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier.

The [[Croatian Parliament]] supported Emperor Charles's [[Pragmatic Sanction]] and signed their own Pragmatic Sanction in 1712.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=404 Povijest saborovanja (History of parliamentarism)]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the emperor pledged to respect all privileges and political rights of [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and the empress [[Maria Theresa]] made significant contributions to Croatian matters.

Between 1797 and 1809 the [[First French Empire]] gradually occupied the entire eastern [[Adriatic]] coastline and a substantial part of its hinterland, ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics, establishing the [[Illyrian Provinces]].{{sfn|Frucht|2005|pp=422–423}} In response the [[Royal Navy]] started the [[Adriatic campaign of 1807–1814|blockade of the Adriatic Sea]] leading to the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Vis]] in 1811.{{sfn|Adkins|Adkins|2008|pp=359–362}} The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813, and absorbed by the [[Austrian Empire]] following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. This led to formation of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] and restoration of the [[Croatian Littoral]] to the Kingdom of Croatia, now both under the same crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTC3IWC_py8C|author=[[Harold Nicolson]]|title=The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity: 1812–1822|publisher=[[Grove Press]]|isbn=978-0-8021-3744-9|page=180|year=2000|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1830s and 1840s saw [[romantic nationalism]] inspire the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian National Revival]], a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of all [[South Slavs]] in the empire. Its primary focus was the establishment of a standard language as a counterweight to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], along with the promotion of Croatian literature and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRIS-Stančić&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Cris: časopis Povijesnog društva Križevci|issn=1332-2567|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=80164|author=Nikša Stančić|title=Hrvatski narodni preporod – ciljevi i ostvarenja|trans_title=Croatian National Revival – goals and achievements|pages=6–17|volume=10|issue=1|date=February 2009|accessdate=7 October 2011|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] Croatia sided with the Austrians, Ban [[Josip Jelačić]] helping defeat the Hungarian forces in 1849, and ushering a period of [[Germanization]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Review of Croatian History|publisher=Croatian Institute of History|issn=1845-4380|volume=4|issue=1|date=December 2008|author=Ante Čuvalo|title=Josip Jelačić – Ban of Croatia|pages=13–27|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=77559|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1860s, failure of the policy became apparent, leading to the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] and creation of a [[personal union]] between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The treaty left the issue of Croatia's status to Hungary, and the status was resolved by the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]] of 1868, when kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~habsweb/sourcetexts/nagodba1.htm|title=Constitution of Union between Croatia-Slavonia and Hungary|publisher=H-net.org|accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control, while [[Rijeka]] retained the status of [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|Corpus separatum]] introduced in 1779.&lt;ref name=&quot;HR-HU-Heka&quot;/&gt;

After [[World War II]], Croatia became a [[single-party]] socialist [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|federal unit]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], ruled by the [[League of Communists of Croatia|Communists]], but enjoying a degree of autonomy within the federation.

[[File:Great Lake, Island of Mljet, Croatia.JPG|thumb|right|Croatia has over a [[List of islands of Croatia|thousand islands]]; pictured Island of [[Mljet]].]]
Croatia is located in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Southeast Europe, bordering [[Hungary]] to the northeast, Serbia to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to the southeast, [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the southwest and [[Slovenia]] to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]] and longitudes [[13th meridian east|13°]] and [[20th meridian east|20° E]]. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding [[Dubrovnik]] is a [[practical exclave]] connected to the rest of the mainland by [[territorial waters]], but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around [[Neum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DZS-Stat2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]]|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/ljetopis/2010/SLJH2010.pdf|format= PDF|title=2010 – Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia|date=December 2010|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory covers {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}, consisting of {{convert|56414|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} of land and {{convert|128|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} of water.

Insular Croatia consists of over [[List of islands of Croatia|a thousand islands and islets]] varying in size, 48 of which are [[List of inhabited islands of Croatia|permanently inhabited]]. The largest islands are [[Cres]] and [[Krk]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; each of them having an area of around {{convert|405|km2|abbr=off}}.

The hilly northern parts of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east (which is part of the [[Pannonian Basin]]) are traversed by major rivers such as [[Sava]], [[Drava]], [[Kupa]] and [[Danube]]. The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of [[Vukovar]] in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Serbia. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Natural resources found in the country in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt and hydropower.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;

Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy [[continental climate]] as defined by the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Mean monthly temperature ranges between {{convert|-3|°C|°F|lk=on}} (in January) and {{convert|18|°C|°F|lk=off}} (in July). The coldest parts of the country are [[Lika]] and [[Gorski Kotar]] where snowy forested climate is found at elevations above {{convert|1200|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by the [[Mediterranean climate]], as the temperature highs are moderated by the sea. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas—the lowest temperature of {{convert|-35.5|°C|°F|lk=off}} was recorded on 3 February 1919 in [[Čakovec]], and the highest temperature of {{convert|42.4|°C|°F|lk=off}} was recorded on 5 July 1950 in [[Karlovac]].{{sfn|Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia 2015|p=42}}

Mean annual precipitation ranges between {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=off}} and {{convert|3500|mm|in|abbr=off}} depending on geographic region and prevailing climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (Vis, [[Lastovo]], [[Biševo]], [[Svetac]]) and in the eastern parts of Slavonia; however, in the latter case, it occurs mostly during the [[growing season]]. The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski kotar.{{sfn|Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia 2015|p=42}}

Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area prevailing winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as [[Bora (wind)|bura]] or less frequently as [[sirocco]]. The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2700&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine per year.{{sfn|Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia 2015|p=43}}

Croatia can be subdivided between a number of [[ecoregion]]s because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are [[karst]] habitats which include submerged karst, such as [[Zrmanja]] and [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.

The karst geology harbours approximately 7,000 caves and pits, some of which are habitat of the only known aquatic cave [[vertebrate]]—the [[olm]]. Forests are also significantly present in the country, as they cover {{convert|2490000|ha|abbr=off}} representing 44% of Croatian land surface. Other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;&gt;{{cite book|publisher=State Institute for Nature Protection, [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)]]|format=PDF|url=http://www.dzzp.hr/dokumenti_upload/20120515/dzzp201205151608230.pdf|title=Biodiversity of Croatia|year= 2006|editor=Jasminka Radović|editor2=Kristijan Čivić|editor3= Ramona Topić|isbn=953-7169-20-0|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of [[phytogeography]], Croatia is a part of the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and the Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Region]]. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests, [[Dinaric Mountains mixed forests]] and [[Illyrian deciduous forests]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DU-Sustdev&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=6th Dubrovnik Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems|url=http://www.dubrovnik2011.sdewes.org/venue.php|title=Venue|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 37,000 known species in Croatia, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt; The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of [[invertebrate]]s discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s (decade) alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt; There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt;
The most serious threat to species is loss and degradation of habitats. A further problem is presented by invasive alien species, especially ''[[Caulerpa taxifolia]]'' algae.

The invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect the [[Benthic zone|benthic habitat]]. Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt;
There are 444 [[protected areas of Croatia]], encompassing 9% of the country. Those include eight [[List of national parks of Croatia|national parks]], two strict reserves, and ten [[nature park]]s. The most famous protected area and the oldest [[national park]] in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a [[World Heritage Sites in Croatia|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]]. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in preparation of the EU accession and joining of the [[Natura 2000]] network.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt;

The Republic of Croatia is a unitary state using a [[parliamentary system]] of governance.

The [[President of Croatia|President of the Republic]] ({{lang-hr|Predsjednik Republike}}) is the [[head of state]], directly elected to a five-year term and is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of two terms. In addition to being the [[commander in chief]] of the armed forces, the president has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the consent of the parliament, and has some influence on foreign policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;VRH-PoliticalStructure&quot;/&gt; The most recent presidential elections were held on 11 January 2015, when [[Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović]] won.

The parliament (''{{lang|hr|Sabor}}'') is a [[unicameral]] legislative body. A second [[chambers of parliament|chamber]], the ''House of Counties'', set up in 1993 pursuant to the 1990 Constitution, was abolished in 2001. The number of Sabor members can vary from 100 to 160; they are all elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.

===Law and judicial system===
{{further|Law of Croatia}}
[[File:Ustavni sud RH nakon obnove.jpg|thumb|right|Seat of the [[Constitutional Court of Croatia|Constitutional Court]] on the [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb]]]]
Croatia has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system in which law arises primarily from written statutes, with judges serving merely as implementers, and not creators of law. Its development was largely influenced by German and Austrian legal systems. Croatian law is divided into two principal areas - [[Civil law (Civil law)|private]] and [[public law]]. The main law in the county is the [[Constitution of Croatia|Constitution]] adopted on December 22, 1990.

The main national courts are the [[Constitutional Court of Croatia|Constitutional Court]], which oversees violations of the Constitution, and the [[Supreme Court of Croatia|Supreme Court]], which is the highest court of appeal. In addition, there are also [[County Court|County]], Municipal, Misdemeanor, Commercial, and Administrative courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;VSRH-about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Supreme Court]]|url=http://www.vsrh.hr/EasyWeb.asp?pcpid=31|language=Croatian|title=Ustavne odredbe|trans_title=Provisions of the Constitution|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are in the first instance decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges. Lay magistrates also participate in trials.&lt;ref&gt;http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2013_03_28_473.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[State's Attorney Office of the Republic of Croatia|State's Attorney Office]] is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors that is empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences.

Law enforcement agencies are organised under the authority of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|Ministry of the Interior]] which consist primarily of the national police force. Croatia's security service is the [[Security and Intelligence Agency]] (SOA).

===Administrative divisions===
{{Further|Counties of Croatia|NUTS of Croatia}}
Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medieval-Counties&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=[[Školska knjiga]] |journal=Historijski zbornik |volume=5 |issue=1–2 |year=1952 |format=PDF |url=http://www.historiografija.hr/hz/1952/HZ_5_11_MANDIC.pdf |author=Oleg Mandić |language=Croatian |title=O nekim pitanjima društvenog uređenja Hrvatske u srednjem vijeku |trans_title=On some issues of social system of Croatia in the Middle Ages |pages=131–138 |accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory, changes of political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and [[Istria]]. Traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced [[oblast]]s and [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]] respectively.{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=429}}

Communist-ruled Croatia, as a constituent part of post-WWII Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities, subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions: In 1918, the [[Transleithania]]n part of Croatia was divided into eight counties with their seats in [[Bjelovar]], [[Gospić]], [[Ogulin]], [[Požega, Croatia|Požega]], Vukovar, [[Varaždin]], [[Osijek]] and Zagreb, and the 1992 legislation established 14 counties in the same territory.{{sfn|Biondich|2000|p=11}}&lt;ref name=&quot;CountiesAct1992&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne novine]] |date=30 December 1992 |accessdate=9 September 2011 |language=Croatian |title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj |trans_title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act |url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1992_12_90_2333.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828162010/http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1992_12_90_2333.html |archivedate=28 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the counties were re-established in 1992, Croatia is divided into 20 [[Counties of Croatia|counties]] and the [[Zagreb|capital city of Zagreb]], the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. Borders of the counties changed in some instances since, with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 [[List of cities in Croatia|cities]] and 429 [[Municipalities of Croatia|municipalities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CountiesAct2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Narodne novine|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=9 September 2011|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj|trans_title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_07_86_2045.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) [[NUTS of Croatia|division of Croatia]] is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast. The Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb, Zagreb, Krapina-Zagorje, Varaždin, Koprivnica-Križevci and Međimurje counties, and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, Požega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac and Sisak-Moslavina counties. Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS [[Local administrative unit]] divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|format=PDF|language=Croatian|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/heritage/cemat/confminist1-15/15eCEMAT_National_Report_Croatia_2010_HR.pdf|title=Nacionalno izviješće Hrvatska|trans_title=Croatia National Report|date=January 2010|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) consist of the [[Croatian Army|Army]], [[Croatian Navy|Navy]] and [[Croatian Air Force and Air Defence|Air Force]] branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia|General Staff]], which reports to the [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Defence Minister]], who in turn reports to the President of Croatia. According to the constitution, the President is [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces and in case of immediate threat during wartime he issues orders directly to the General Staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAFstructure&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osrh.hr/prikaz_en.asp?idi=100&amp;kati=2|title=Chain of Command in the CAF|publisher=Croatian Ministry of Defence|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1991–95 war defence spending and CAF size have been in constant decline. {{As of|2005}} military spending was an estimated 2.39% of the country's GDP, which placed Croatia 64th in a ranking of all countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hr.html|title=World Factbook|accessdate=9 September 2011|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005 the budget was kept below 2% of GDP, down from the record high of 11.1% in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;sipri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |title=SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] |accessdate=9 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally relying on a large number of conscripts, CAF also went through a period of reforms focused on downsizing, restructuring and [[professionalisation]] in the years prior to [[Accession of Croatia to NATO|Croatia's accession to NATO]] in April 2009. According to a presidential decree issued in 2006 the CAF is set to employ 18,100 active duty military personnel, 3,000 civilians and 2,000 voluntary conscripts between the ages of 18 and 30 in peacetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAFstructure&quot;/&gt;

Compulsory conscription was abolished in January 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; Until 2008 military service was compulsory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 from the earlier scheme of nine-month conscription tours.

The [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] and [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]] dialects are distinguished by their [[lexicon]], [[phonology]], and [[syntax]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brozović-HRV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics]]|language=Croatian|title=Organska podloga hrvatskog jezika|trans_title=Organic Base of the Croatian Language|url= http://www.ihjj.hr/oHrJeziku-povijest-1.html|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1961 to 1991, the official language was [[Serbo-Croatian]].

Efforts made to impose policies to alter Croatian into &quot;Serbo-Croatian&quot; or &quot;South Slavic&quot; language, met resistance from Croats in form of [[Croatian linguistic purism]]. Croatian replaced [[Latin language|Latin]] as the official language of the Croatian government in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iadertina-Hr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Croatica et Slavica Iadertina|issn=1845-6839|title=Značenje narodnoga preporoda za hrvatski jezik|trans_title=Significance of the National Revival for Croatian Language|language=Croatian|author=Branka Tafra|date=February 2007|volume=2|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=26666|pages=43–55|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Croatian cuisine|Croatian wine}}
[[File:Homar 3.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lobster]] from Dalmatia.]]
Croatian traditional cuisine varies from one region to another. Dalmatia and Istria draw upon culinary influences of [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and other [[Mediterranean cuisine]]s which prominently feature various seafood, cooked vegetables and pasta, as well as condiments such as olive oil and garlic. The continental cuisine is heavily influenced by [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Austrian cuisine|Austrian]] and [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] culinary styles. In that area, meats, freshwater fish and vegetable dishes are predominant.&lt;ref name=&quot;HTZ-cuisine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Croatian National Tourist Board|url=http://croatia.hr/en-GB/Discover-Croatia/Gastronomy-and-enology|accessdate=13 October 2011|title=Gastronomy and enology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two distinct wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental region in the northeast of the country, especially Slavonia, is capable of producing premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk wines are similar to those produced in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red wines are the norm.&lt;ref name=&quot;HTZ-cuisine&quot;/&gt; Annual production of wine exceeds 140&amp;nbsp;million litres.&lt;ref name=&quot;DZS-Stat2010&quot;/&gt; Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive production and consumption of beer started;&lt;ref name=&quot;skenderovic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.matica.hr/HRRevija/revija032.nsf/AllWebDocs/skenderovic|title=Kako je pivo došlo u Hrvatsku|last=Skenderović|first=Robert|year=2002|work=[[Hrvatska revija]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the annual consumption of beer in 2008 was 83.3&amp;nbsp;litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirinholdings.co.jp/english/news/2009/1221_01.html|title=2008 Per-Capita Beer Consumption by Country|date=21 December 2009|work=Kirin Institute of Food and Lifestyle Report Vol. 22|publisher=[[Kirin Brewery Company]]|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
