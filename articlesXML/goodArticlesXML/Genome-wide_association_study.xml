      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45642">In [[genetics]], a '''genome-wide association study''' ('''GWA study''', or '''GWAS'''), also known as '''whole genome association study''' ('''WGA study''', or '''WGAS'''), is an examination of a genome-wide set of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variants]] in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWASs typically focus on associations between [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other organism.

Each dot represents a [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]], with the X-axis showing genomic location and Y-axis showing [[Genetic association|association level]].

In the case of GWAS applied to human data, these studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. Participants in a GWAS study may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to [[Genotype-first approach|genotype-first]]. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variants]] are read using [[SNP array]]s. If one type of the variant (one [[allele]]) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be ''associated'' with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease. In contrast to methods that specifically test one or a few genetic regions, the GWA studies investigate the entire genome. The approach is therefore said to be ''non-candidate-driven'' in contrast to ''[[candidate gene|gene-specific candidate-driven studies]]''. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20647212&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Manolio TA | title = Genomewide association studies and assessment of the risk of disease | journal = N.

The first successful GWAS was published in 2005. It investigated patients with [[age-related macular degeneration]] and found two SNPs with significantly altered [[allele frequency]] compared to healthy controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15761122&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Klein RJ| author2 = Zeiss C| author3 = Chew EY| author4 = Tsai JY| author5 = Sackler RS| author6 = Haynes C| author7 = Henning AK| author8 = SanGiovanni JP| author9 = Mane SM| author10 = Mayne ST| author11 = Bracken MB| author12 = Ferris FL| author13 = Ott J| author14 = Barnstable C| author15 =  Hoh J | title = Complement Factor H Polymorphism in Age-Related Macular Degeneration | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 385–9 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15761122 | pmc = 1512523 | doi = 10.1126/science.1109557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, hundreds or thousands of individuals are tested, over 1,200 human GWA studies have examined over 200 diseases and traits, and almost 4,000 SNP associations have been found.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19161620&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johnson AD| author2 = O'Donnell CJ | title = An Open Access Database of Genome-wide Association Results | journal = BMC Med.

However, the methodology itself still has opponents.

==Background==
[[File:GWAS Disease allele effects.png|thumb|340px|GWA studies typically identify common variants with small effect sizes (''lower right'').&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23300413&quot; /&gt;]]
Any two [[human genome]]s differ in millions of different ways.  There are small variations in the individual nucleotides of the genomes ([[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]]) as well as many larger variations, such as [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[copy number variation]]s. Any of these may cause alterations in an individual's traits, or [[phenotype]], which can be anything from disease risk to physical properties such as height.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strachan&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Strachan T| author2 = Read  A | title = Human Molecular Genetics | edition = 4th | publisher = Garland Science | pages = 467–495 | isbn = 978-0-8153-4149-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 2000, prior to the introduction of GWA studies, the primary method of investigation was through inheritance studies of [[genetic linkage]] in families. This approach had proven highly useful towards [[Genetic disorder#Single gene disorder|single gene disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.omim.org | title = Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man | accessdate = 2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for common and complex diseases the results of genetic linkage studies proved hard to reproduce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strachan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11565063&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Altmüller J| author2 = Palmer LJ| author3 = Fischer G| author4 = Scherb H| author5 = Wjst M | title = Genomewide Scans of Complex Human Diseases: True Linkage Is Hard to Find | journal = Am. J. Hum. Genet. | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 936–50 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11565063 | pmc = 1274370 | doi = 10.1086/324069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A suggested alternative to linkage studies was the [[genetic association]] study. This study type asks if the [[allele]] of a [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variant]] is found more often than expected in individuals with the phenotype of interest (e.g. with the disease being studied). Early calculations on statistical power indicated that this approach could be better than linkage studies at detecting weak genetic effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8801636&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Risch N| author2 = Merikangas K | title = The future of genetic studies of complex human diseases | journal = Science | volume = 273 | issue = 5281 | pages = 1516–7 | date = September 1996 | pmid = 8801636 | doi = 10.1126/science.273.5281.1516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of [[biobanks]], which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17550341&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Greely HT | title = The uneasy ethical and legal underpinnings of large-scale genomic biobanks | journal = Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet | volume = 8 | pages = 343–64 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17550341 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the [[International HapMap Project]], which, from 2003 identified a majority of the common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14685227&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = The International HapMap Project, Gibbs RA, Belmont JW,  Hardenbol P, Willis TD, Yu F, Yang H, Ch'Ang L-Y, Huang W | title = The International HapMap Project | journal = Nature | volume = 426 | issue = 6968 | pages = 789–96 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14685227 | doi = 10.1038/nature02168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Haplotype|haploblock structure]] identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using [[SNP array|genotyping arrays]] was an important prerequisite.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7569999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schena M| author2 = Shalon D| author3 = Davis RW| author4 = Brown PO | title = Quantitative monitoring of gene expression patterns with a complementary DNA microarray | journal = Science | volume = 270 | issue = 5235 | pages = 467–70 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 7569999 | doi = 10.1126/science.270.5235.467 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:Method example for GWA study designs.png|thumb|300px|Example calculation illustrating the methodology of a case-control GWA study. The [[allele]] count of each measured SNP is evaluated—in this case with a [[chi-squared test]]—to identify variants [[Genetic association|associated]] with the trait in question. The numbers in this example are taken from a 2007 study of [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD) that showed that the individuals with the G-allele of SNP1 (''rs1333049'') were overrepresented amongst CAD-patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17554300&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium | title = Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7145 | pages = 661–78 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17554300 | pmc = 2719288 | doi = 10.1038/nature05911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most common approach of GWA studies is the [[Case-control study|case-control]] setup, which compares two large groups of individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped for the majority of common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23300413&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bush WS| author2 = Moore JH | title = Chapter 11: genome-wide association studies | journal = PLoS Comput Biol | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = e1002822 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23300413 | pmc = 3531285 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002822 | editor2-last = Kann | editor1-last = Lewitter | editor2-first = Maricel | editor1-first = Fran }}&lt;/ref&gt; For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the [[allele frequency]] is significantly altered between the case and the control group.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21293453&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Clarke GM| author2 = Anderson CA| author3 = Pettersson FH| author4 = Cardon LR| author5 = Morris AP| author6 = Zondervan KT | title = Basic statistical analysis in genetic case-control studies | journal = Nat Protoc | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–33 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21293453 | pmc = 3154648 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2010.182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the [[odds ratio]]. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a [[P-value]] for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple [[chi-squared test]]. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21293453&quot; /&gt;

There are several variations to this case-control approach.  A common alternative to case-control GWA studies is the analysis of quantitative phenotypic data, e.g. height or [[Biomarker (medicine)|biomarker]] concentrations or even [[Expression quantitative trait loci|gene expression]]. Likewise, alternative statistics designed for [[Dominance (genetics)|dominance]] or [[recessive]] penetrance patterns can be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21293453&quot; /&gt; Calculations are typically done using [[bioinformatics]] software such as SNPTEST and PLINK, which also include support for many of these alternative statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7145 | pages = 661–678 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17554300 | pmc = 2719288 | doi = 10.1038/nature05911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17701901&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Purcell S| author2 = Neale B| author3 = Todd-Brown K| author4 = Thomas L| author5 = Ferreira MA| author6 = Bender D| author7 = Maller J| author8 = Sklar P| author9 = de Bakker PI| author10 = Daly MJ| author11 = Sham PC | title = PLINK: A Tool Set for Whole-Genome Association and Population-Based Linkage Analyses | journal = Am.

However, the empirical evidence shows that complex interactions among two or more SNPs, [[epistasis]], might contribute to complex diseases. Moreover, the researchers tries to integrate GWA data with other biological data such as [[Protein–protein interaction|protein protein interaction network]]  to extract more informative results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = MOBAS: identification of disease-associated protein subnetworks using modularity-based scoring|url = http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13637-015-0025-6|journal = EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology|date = 2015-06-30|issn = 1687-4153|pages = 1–14|volume = 2015|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/s13637-015-0025-6|language = en|first = Marzieh|last = Ayati|first2 = Sinan|last2 = Erten|first3 = Mark R.|last3 = Chance|first4 = Mehmet|last4 = Koyutürk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessing the Collective Disease Association of Multiple Genomic Loci|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2808719.2808758|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 6th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics|date = 2015-01-01|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-1-4503-3853-0|pages = 376–385|series = BCB '15|doi = 10.1145/2808719.2808758|first = Marzieh|last = Ayati|first2 = Mehmet|last2 = Koyutürk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key step in the majority of GWA studies is the [[Imputation (genetics)|imputation]] of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marchini J| author2 = Howie B | title = Genotype imputation for genome-wide association studies | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 499–511 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20517342 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be tested for association, increases the power of the study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Howie B| author2 = Marchini J| author3 = Stephens M | title = Genotype imputation with thousands of genomes | journal = G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 457–70 | date = 2011 | pmid = 22384356 | pmc = 3276165 | doi = 10.1534/g3.111.001198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MaCH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cáp J| author2 = Misíková Z | title = Chronic myelogenous leukaemia as a possible consequence of immunosuppressive treatment of nephrotic syndrome (author's transl) | journal = Monatsschrift fur Kinderheilkunde | volume = 123 | issue = 10 | pages = 718–20 | date = 1975 | pmid = 1058334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the calculation of association, it is common to take into account any variables that could potentially [[confounding|confound]] the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with the geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18758442&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Novembre J| author2 = Johnson T| author3 = Bryc K| author4 = Kutalik Z| author5 = Boyko AR| author6 = Auton A| author7 = Indap A| author8 = King KS| author9 = Bergmann S| author10 = Nelson MR| author11 = Stephens M| author12 = Bustamante CD | title = Genes mirror geography within Europe | journal = Nature | volume = 456 | issue = 7218 | pages = 98–101 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18758442 | pmc = 2735096 | doi = 10.1038/nature07331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographical and ethnical background of participants by controlling for what is called [[population stratification]].

After odds ratios and [[P-value]]s have been calculated for all SNPs, a common approach is to create a [[Manhattan plot]]. In the context of GWA studies, this plot shows the negative logarithm of the [[P-value]] as a function of genomic location. Thus the SNPs with the most significant association stands out on the plot, usually as stacks of points because of haploblock structure. Importantly, the P-value threshold for significance is corrected for [[multiple comparisons|multiple testing]] issues. The exact threshold varies by study,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24473445&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Wittkowski KM| author2 = Sonakya V| author3 = Bigio B| author4 = Tonn MK| author5 = Shic F| author6 = Ascano M| author7 = Nasca C| author8 = Gold-Von Simson G | title = A novel computational biostatistics approach implies impaired dephosphorylation of growth factor receptors as associated with severity of autism | journal = Transl Psychiatry | volume = 4 | pages = e354 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24473445 | pmc = 3905234 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2013.124 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the conventional threshold is {{val|5|e=-8}} to be significant in the face of hundreds of thousands to millions of tested SNPs.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23300413&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21293453&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barsh GS| author2 = Copenhaver GP| author3 = Gibson G| author4 = Williams SM | title = Guidelines for Genome-Wide Association Studies | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = e1002812 | date = 5 July 2012 | pmid = 22792080 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002812 | pmc=3390399}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 21 August 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; GWA studies typically perform the first analysis in a discovery cohort, followed by validation of the most significant SNPs in an independent validation cohort.

Attempts have been made at creating comprehensive catalogues of SNPs that have been identified from GWA studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19474294&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Hindorff LA| author2 = Sethupathy P| author3 = Junkins HA| author4 = Ramos EM| author5 = Mehta JP| author6 = Collins FS| author7 = Manolio TA | title = Potential etiologic and functional implications of genome-wide association loci for human diseases and traits | journal = Proc.

The first GWA study, conducted in 2005, compared 96 patients with [[age-related macular degeneration]] (ARMD) with 50 healthy controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15761120&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Haines JL| author2 = Hauser MA| author3 = Schmidt S| author4 = Scott WK| author5 = Olson LM| author6 = Gallins P| author7 = Spencer KL| author8 = Kwan SY| author9 = Noureddine M| author10 = Gilbert JR| author11 = Schnetz-Boutaud N| author12 = Agarwal A| author13 = Postel EA| author14 = Pericak-Vance MA | title = Complement Factor H Variant Increases the Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 419–421 | date = 2005 | pmid = 15761120 | doi = 10.1126/science.1110359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It identified two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency between the two groups. These SNPs were located in the gene encoding [[complement factor H]], which was an unexpected finding in the research of ARMD. The findings from these first GWA studies have subsequently prompted further functional research towards therapeutical manipulation of the complement system in ARMD.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21860027&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Fridkis-Hareli M| author2 = Storek M| author3 = Mazsaroff I| author4 = Risitano AM| author5 = Lundberg AS| author6 = Horvath CJ| author7 = Holers VM | title = Design and development of TT30, a novel C3d-targeted C3/C5 convertase inhibitor for treatment of human complement alternative pathway–mediated diseases | journal = Blood | volume = 118 | issue = 17 | pages = 4705–13 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21860027 | pmc = 3208285 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2011-06-359646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another landmark publication in the history of GWA studies was the [[Wellcome Trust]] Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study, the largest GWA study ever conducted at the time of its publication in 2007. The WTCCC included 14,000 cases of seven common diseases (~2,000 individuals for each of [[coronary heart disease]], [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[bipolar disorder]], and [[hypertension]]) and 3,000 shared controls.&lt;ref name=WTCCC&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, Burton PR| author2 = Clayton DG| author3 = Cardon LR| title = Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7145 | pages = 661–78 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17554300 | pmc = 2719288 | doi = 10.1038/nature05911 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was successful in uncovering many new disease genes underlying these diseases.&lt;ref name=WTCCC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.wtccc.org.uk/info/070606.shtml |title=Largest ever study of genetics of common diseases published today |publisher=Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these first landmark GWA studies, there have been two general trends.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19373277&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ioannidis JP| author2 = Thomas G| author3 = Daly MJ | title = Validating, augmenting and refining genome-wide association signals | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 318–29 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19373277 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2544 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19373277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21909115&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Ehret GB| author2 = Munroe PB| author3 = Rice KM| author4 = Bochud M| author5 = Johnson AD| author6 = Chasman DI| author7 = et al. | title = Genetic variants in novel pathways influence blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk | journal = Nature | volume = 478 | issue = 7367 | pages = 103–9 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21909115 | pmc = 3340926 | doi = 10.1038/nature10405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller [[odds ratios]] and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as [[blood lipids]], [[proinsulin]] or similar biomarkers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19060906&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Kathiresan S| author2 = Willer CJ| author3 = Peloso GM| author4 = Demissie S| author5 = Musunuru K| author6 = Schadt EE| author7 = et al. | title = Common variants at 30 loci contribute to polygenic dyslipidemia | journal = Nat.

A central point of debate on GWA studies has been that most of the SNP variations found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20647212&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20300123&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ku CS| author2 = Loy EY| author3 = Pawitan Y| author4 = Chia KS | title = The pursuit of genome-wide association studies: where are we now? | journal = J.

This [[heritability|heritable]] variation is known from heritability studies based on [[monozygotic]] twins.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18987709&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maher B | title = Personal genomes: The case of the missing heritability | journal = Nature | volume = 456 | issue = 7218 | pages = 18–21 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18987709 | doi = 10.1038/456018a }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is known that 80–90% of height is heritable. Of these 80-90%, however, the GWA studies only account for a minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18987709&quot;/&gt;

==Clinical applications==
A challenge for future successful GWA study is to apply the findings in a way that accelerates [[drug development|drug]] and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new [[pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] and [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19759611&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Iadonato SP| author2 = Katze MG | title = Genomics: Hepatitis C virus gets personal | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7262 | pages = 357–8 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19759611 | doi = 10.1038/461357a }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of [[prognosis]]. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20837927&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Muehlschlegel JD| author2 = Liu KY| author3 = Perry TE| author4 = Fox AA| author5 = Collard CD| author6 = Shernan SK| author7 = Body SC | title = Chromosome 9p21 Variant Predicts Mortality after CABG Surgery | journal = Circulation | volume = 122 | issue = 11 Suppl | pages = S60–5 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20837927 | pmc = 2943860 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others report only minor benefits from this use.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20159871&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Paynter NP| author2 = Chasman DI| author3 = Paré G| author4 = Buring JE| author5 = Cook NR| author6 = Miletich JP| author7 = Ridker PM | title = Association between a Literature-Based Genetic Risk Score and Cardiovascular Events in 19,313 Women | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 7 | pages = 631–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20159871 | pmc = 2845522 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate [[pathophysiology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20522751&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Couzin-Frankel J | title = Major heart disease genes prove elusive | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5983 | pages = 1220–1 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20522751 | doi = 10.1126/science.328.5983.1220 }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such success is related to identifying the genetic variant associated with response to anti-[[hepatitis C]] virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a]] or [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b]] combined with [[ribavirin]], a GWA study&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19684573&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Ge D| author2 = Fellay J| author3 = Thompson AJ| author4 = Simon JS| author5 = Shianna KV| author6 = Urban TJ| author7 = Heinzen EL| author8 =  Qiu P| author9 = Bertelsen AH| author10 = Muir AJ| author11 = Sulkowski M| author12 = McHutchison JG| author13 = Goldstein DB | title = Genetic variation in IL28B predicts hepatitis C treatment-induced viral clearance | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7262 | pages = 399–401 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19684573 | doi = 10.1038/nature08309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that SNPs near the human [[Interleukin 28B|IL28B]] gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in response to the treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19759533&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Thomas DL| author2 = Thio CL| author3 = Martin MP, Qi Y| author4 = Ge D| author5 = O'Huigin C| author6 = Kidd J| author7 = Kidd K| author8 = Khakoo SI| author9 = Alexander G| author10 = Goedert JJ| author11 = Kirk GD| author12 = Donfield SM| author13 = Rosen HR| author14 = Tobler LH| author15 = Busch MP| author16 = McHutchison JG| author17 = Goldstein DB| author18 = Carrington M | title = Genetic variation in IL28B and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7265 | pages = 798–801 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19759533 | pmc = 3172006 | doi = 10.1038/nature08463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=YF|last2=Goldstein|first2=DB|last3=Angrist|first3=M|last4=Cavalleri|first4=G|title=Personalized medicine and human genetic diversity|journal=Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine|date=24 July 2014|volume=4|issue=9|pages=a008581|pmid=25059740|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a008581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of elucidating pathophysiology has also led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the [[gene expression]] of nearby genes, the so-called [[expression quantitative trait loci]] (eQTL) studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20562444&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Folkersen L| author2 = van't Hooft F| author3 = Chernogubova E| author4 = Agardh HE| author5 = Hansson GK| author6 = Hedin U| author7 = Liska J| author8 = Syvänen AC| author9 = Paulsson-Berne G| author10 = Paulssson-Berne G| author11 = Franco-Cereceda A| author12 = Hamsten A| author13 = Gabrielsen A| author14 = Eriksson P | title = Association of genetic risk variants with expression of proximal genes identifies novel susceptibility genes for cardiovascular disease | journal = Circ Cardiovasc Genet | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 365–73 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20562444 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.948935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and specification of genes is one step closer towards actionable [[Biological target#Drug targets|drug targets]].

==Limitations==
GWA studies have several issues and limitations that can be taken care of through proper quality control and study setup. Lack of well defined case and control groups, insufficient sample size, control for [[multiple comparisons|multiple testing]] and control for [[population stratification]] are common problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18349094&quot; /&gt;  Particularly the statistical issue of multiple testing wherein it has been noted that &quot;the GWA approach can be problematic because the massive number of statistical tests performed presents an unprecedented potential for [[false-positive]] results&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18349094&quot;/&gt; Ignoring these correctible issues has been cited as contributing to a general sense of problems with the GWA methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.genomesunzipped.org/2011/11/size-matters-and-other-lessons-from-medical-genetics.php | title = Size matters, and other lessons from medical genetics | accessdate = 2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to easily correctible problems such as these, some more subtle but important issues have surfaced. A high-profile GWA study that investigated individuals with very long life spans to identify SNPs associated with longevity is an example of this.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20595579&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Sebastiani P| author2 = Solovieff N| author3 = Puca A| author4 = Hartley SW| author5 = Melista E| author6 = Andersen S| author7 = Dworkis DA| author8 = Wilk JB| author9 = Myers RH| author10 = Steinberg MH| author11 = Montano M| author12 = Baldwin CT| author13 = Perls TT | title = Genetic signatures of exceptional longevity in humans | journal = Science | volume = 2010 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20595579 | doi = 10.1126/science.1190532 }}{{Retracted|intentional=yes}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication came under scrutiny because of a discrepancy between the type of [[SNP array|genotyping array]] in the case and control group, which caused several SNPs to be falsely highlighted as associated with longevity.&lt;ref name=MacArthur&gt;{{Cite journal | title =   Serious flaws revealed in &quot;longevity genes&quot; study | url = http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/07/serious-flaws-revealed-in-longevity-genes-study/ | author = MacArthur, Daniel | journal = Wired | accessdate = 2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was subsequently [[Retraction|retracted]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21778381&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 4| author = Sebastiani P| author2 = Solovieff N| author3 = Puca A| author4 = Hartley SW| author5 = Melista E| author6 = Andersen S| author7 = Dworkis DA| author8 = Wilk JB| author9 = Myers RH| author10 = Steinberg MH| author11 = Montano M| author12 = Baldwin CT| author13 = Perls TT | title = Retraction | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6041 | pages = 404 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21778381 | doi = 10.1126/science.333.6041.404-a }}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays a large role in explaining the heritable variation of common disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22243964&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Visscher PM| author2 = Brown MA| author3 = McCarthy MI| author4 = Yang J | title = Five years of GWAS discovery | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 90 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–24 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22243964 | pmc = 3257326 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.11.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20522751&quot;/&gt; Alternative strategies suggested involve [[linkage analysis]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome [[sequencing]] have also provided a realistic alternative to [[SNP array|genotyping array]]-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21670730&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Visscher PM| author2 = Goddard ME | authorlink2 = Michael E.

==Fine-mapping==

Genotyping arrays designed for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide coverage of the entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants are unlikely to be the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.

Fine-mapping requires all variants in the associated region to have been genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.
