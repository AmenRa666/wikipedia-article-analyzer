'''Gojira''' is a French [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Bayonne]]. Originally formed as '''Godzilla''' in 1996, they changed their name to Gojira in 2001 prior to releasing any studio albums. The band's lineup, consisting of brothers [[Joe Duplantier]] (vocals, guitars) and [[Mario Duplantier]] (drums) as well as guitarist [[Christian Andreu]] and bassist [[Jean-Michel Labadie]], has been the same since then. They have released six studio albums and three live DVDs. They are known for their [[Natural environment|environmentally]]-themed lyrics and have gone from &quot;utmost obscurity&quot; to being placed &quot;amongst the genre's leading new millennium upstarts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p822709/biography|pure_url=yes}} Gojira] at [[AllMusic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was released 26 June 2012 through Roadrunner Records. On March 11, 2014, Gojira released a Live CD/DVD/Picture book [[Les Enfants Sauvages]], which was recorded at [[Brixton Academy]] London in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In November 2014 the band began constructing a recording studio in Queens, New York City. That same month, Mario Duplantier moved to New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/gojira-preview-emotional-epic-new-album-20160330?page=3|title=Gojira Preview 'Emotional,' 'Epic' New Album|date=2016-03-30|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview conducted in February 2015 with AMH TV, Mario Duplantier stated that the band is working on a new album. Further speaking with AMH TV, he went on to say that &quot;We spent two months... composing new stuff, composing new songs. And we feel very optimistic about the future. We're already enjoying a lot of the new stuff. We want to make the strongest album we can do. I mean, all the bands say they try to make the strongest album, but this time, I think we will really do it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In April 2015 the band finished the construction of their New York recording studio, 'Silver Cord Studio'. However, ten days into recording there, Joe and Mario Duplantier learned that their mother had fallen very ill and so the band put the recording session on hold. Their mother later died, and this experience had a profound influence on the recording process.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/gojira-releases-stranded-video-unveils-magma-album-artwork/|title=GOJIRA Releases 'Stranded' Video, Unveils 'Magma' Album Artwork|date=2016-04-22|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gojira plays a technical and rhythmic style of heavy metal with precision drumming along with [[blast beat]]s, unusual rhythm patterns, and start-and-stop riffs. Gojira has also been known to incorporate textured atmospheric elements and instrumental songs into their music.&lt;ref name=&quot;about.com Link&quot; /&gt; Gojira songs have progressive and uncommon [[song structure]]s, rarely using the standard [[Verse-chorus form|verse, chorus, verse]] [[songwriting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about.com Link&quot; /&gt;The vocal style is varied, ranging from the screamed style often employed in extreme metal, with the death growl style predominantly used in death metal, in addition to clean vocals and higher screams. At times, death metal growls and clean vocals are mixed to create an aggressive but melodic effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;tmf&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;about.com FMTS&quot;/&gt;

Gojira's lyrics tackle themes of life, death, rebirth, spirituality, and nature. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/upcoming-releases/gojira-frontman-talks-lyrical-themes-upcoming-album|title=GOJIRA Frontman Talks Lyrical Themes Of Upcoming Album - Metal Injection|date=2011-08-29|website=Metal Injection|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nocleansinging.com/2010/08/01/gojira-is-the-best/|title=NO CLEAN SINGING » Why Gojira is the Best Metal Band in the World|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, their 2005 album ''[[From Mars to Sirius]]'' is a concept album tackling environmental issues as well as broader themes of life, death, and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2009/06/24/9-gojira-from-mars-to-sirius/|title=#9: GOJIRA - FROM MARS TO SIRIUS|date=2009-06-24|website=MetalSucks|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the band were raised in [[Bayonne]], a city on the south west coast of France ([[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]]/[[French Basque Country]]). The surrounding scenic countryside and rugged coastline inspired Gojira's interest in nature and the earth. Gojira uses its lyrics to spread its spiritual beliefs and concerns for the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;OWGB&quot;&gt;

Members from Sea Shepherd Conservation Society are allowed to run a merchandise booth at Gojira gigs. In addition, Gojira is working on the Sea Shepherd EP with well-known musicians from the metal scene, including [[Devin Townsend]].
