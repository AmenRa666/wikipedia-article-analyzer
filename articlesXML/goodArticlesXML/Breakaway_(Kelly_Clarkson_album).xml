'''''Breakaway''''' is the second [[studio album]] by American singer [[Kelly Clarkson]], released on November 30, 2004, by [[RCA Records]]. The album is a follow-up to her successful debut album, ''[[Thankful (Kelly Clarkson album)|Thankful]]'' (2003). Executive produced by [[Clive Davis]], ''Breakaway'' sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily [[Dr. Luke]], [[Max Martin]], [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Kara DioGuardi]], [[Ben Moody]], and [[David Hodges]]; the latter two are former members of American rock band [[Evanescence]]. Despite the established commercial success of ''Thankful'', music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an ''[[American Idol]]'' winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, in pursuit of a [[pop rock]] direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager [[Simon Fuller]] and hire the management services of [[Jeff Kwatinetz]] before the album's release. ''Breakaway'' is predominately a pop rock album with elements of [[rock music|rock]] and [[blue-eyed soul|soul]] music, marking a departure from the R&amp;B-oriented sound of ''Thankful''; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.

''Breakaway'' received a positive response from music critics, with many commending the album's new-found pop rock sound and Clarkson's vocal performances. It received several awards and nominations, including winning two [[Grammy Award]]s and receiving a nomination for a [[Juno Award]]. The album became a commercial success worldwide. By selling over 15 million copies worldwide, it remains Clarkson's most successful album to date. After debuting at number three on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]] in the United States, it stayed on the top twenty of the chart for more than a year, eventually being certified [[RIAA certification|6× multi-platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of more than six million copies.

''Breakaway''{{'}}s singles &quot;[[Since U Been Gone]]&quot;, &quot;[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]&quot;, &quot;[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Walk Away (Kelly Clarkson song)|Walk Away]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]&quot; became worldwide hits and have become some of Clarkson's signature songs. Their successes prompted ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' to credit her for landscaping the core sound of [[mainstream pop music]] as an uptempo [[dance-pop|dance-oriented]] sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, ''Breakaway'' established Clarkson as one of the four highest-selling acts of [[Sony BMG]] in the 2000s, and made Davis, Dr. Luke, and Martin into prominent pop producers today. Internationally, the album topped the music charts of Ireland and the Netherlands and became the world's 7th biggest-selling release of 2005, eventually being [[record certification|certified platinum]] in over 17 countries. To support ''Breakaway'', Clarkson embarked on three international concert tours from 2005 to 2006: the [[Breakaway World Tour]], [[Hazel Eyes Tour]], and the [[Addicted Tour]]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' placed the album 77th in  the ''Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums''.

==Background and production==
[[File:AvrilVancouver.jpg|thumb|left|150px|thumbnail|left|The title track &quot;Breakaway&quot; was co-written by [[Avril Lavigne]] (pictured), who originally intended it to be included on her debut album ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 9&quot; /&gt;]]

In early 2004, Clarkson began working on new material for her second studio album, which followed her successful debut album ''[[Thankful (Kelly Clarkson album)|Thankful]]'' (2003), while co-headlining the [[Independent Tour]] with [[Clay Aiken]], the runner-up from the [[American Idol (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salt Lake Tribune 1&quot; /&gt; She had also expressed intentions to record with [[Fantasia Barrino]], who had then just won the series' [[American Idol (season 3)|third season]]; both were expected to release their albums in the same month.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 7&quot; /&gt;

As she began to work for the album with music executive [[Clive Davis]], Clarkson was invited by [[Whitney Houston]] to record the song &quot;[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]&quot;, which would be included for the [[The Princess Diaries soundtracks|soundtrack]] of the 2004 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] feature film ''[[The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement]]'', which Houston had co-produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt; The song, written by [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Matthew Gerrard]], and [[Bridget Benenate]], was initially written for Lavigne's debut album ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'' (2002) but deemed unsuitable for the album's themes at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 9&quot; /&gt; Initially reluctant, Clarkson agreed to record the song.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt; &quot;Breakaway&quot; was first released on July 2004 by [[Walt Disney Records]] as a single from the soundtrack, acting as an interim record until her second album's lead single was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 9&quot; /&gt; After debuting on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart at number 60, it peaked at number six, a week before the album's release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 12&quot; /&gt;

In April 2004, Clarkson entered the studio immediately after the Independent Tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salt Lake Tribune 1&quot; /&gt; She said in an interview, &quot;I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's some people who have some stuff for me. I'm not one of those people who thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 9&quot; /&gt; During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, &quot;I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like [[Melissa Manchester]] and [[Taylor Dayne]] could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine 1&quot; /&gt; Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, &quot;I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine 1&quot; /&gt; In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians [[Ben Moody]] and [[David Hodges]], who had just departed from their band [[Evanescence]] in late 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 7&quot; /&gt; She said, &quot;I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore,&quot; Clarkson said. &quot;I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing&amp;nbsp;... so it worked out perfectly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 7&quot; /&gt; Moody recalled, &quot;It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 10&quot; /&gt;

Worried of Clarkson being continually typecast as a talent show winner, Davis met with various producers, primarily [[Max Martin]], and encouraged them to produce records for Clarkson in a pop rock direction. Clarkson revealed that she expected that she'll always be labeled as an ''American Idol'' winner; she remarked, &quot;I'm the first one, so it's going to be on my grave, I'm aware of that. (There's no getting away from it) so why even try?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salt Lake Tribune 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 7&quot; /&gt; Upon their meeting, Martin presented songs he wrote with [[Dr. Luke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 14&quot; /&gt; These songs include &quot;[[Since U Been Gone]]&quot; and a demo version of what would have been &quot;[[Behind These Hazel Eyes]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt; Davis wanted Clarkson to record the songs, describing them having &quot;a sharp rock edge but were still capable of being pop hits. They would push Kelly in a promising direction for her, while maintaining and even growing her audience.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt; Martin insisted that the songs should be given to rock acts, wanting to stray from his reputation for producing pop singles for the [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Britney Spears]] in the [[1990s in music|1990s]]. Davis recalled, &quot;Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an ''American Idol'' winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 14&quot; /&gt; Martin and Dr. Luke eventually agreed and invited Clarkson to travel to Sweden to record the songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 14&quot; /&gt; Upon hearing the tracks, Clarkson was skeptical of the pop elements; and the three eventually decided to develop a rock sound,&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 14&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; a move Clarkson claimed Davis did not approve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jezebel 1&quot; /&gt; Davis reiterated that he was ecstatic with the prospect, claiming that she disliked it and demanded that both the songs be removed from the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt; Clarkson then asserted that she wanted it to be on the record and claimed that Davis had detested &quot;[[Because of You (Kelly Clarkson song)|Because of You]]&quot; instead,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jezebel 1&quot; /&gt; saying that she &quot;was a shitty writer (''sic'') who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon her&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jezebel 1&quot; /&gt; Davis reiterated that he loved the song and felt that Clarkson could indeed write hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt;

===Style and inspirations===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=&quot;I grew up with [[Aerosmith]], and I love listening to [[Jimi Hendrix]]. I grew up with a lot of rock influences in my life, but as well as a lot of [[Aretha Franklin]], a lot of soul, so I don't know. I don't wanna limit myself, so I'm gonna kind of do whatever I want and put it on the record.&quot; |source=Clarkson on ''Breakaway''{{'}} musical influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 8&quot; /&gt; }}
Wanting to stray away from the [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]]-styled music of ''Thankful'', which she described as a showcase of versatility, she revealed that ''Thankful''{{'}}s success &quot;empowered me to step more into rock, step more into the soulful vibe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salt Lake Tribune 1&quot; /&gt; She described the music of the second album as &quot;like the first CD in the sense that it's versatile, but it's more into the [[Rock music|rock]], It's more into the [[Blue-eyed soul|soulful]] roots, and it's just a little bit deeper, so it's pretty cool.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 8&quot; /&gt; Dr. Luke revealed in an interview that [[alternative music]] and [[independent music|indie music]] were inspirations to &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot;, saying, &quot;That was a conscious move by Max [Martin] and myself, because we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song-I don't remember what it was. I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes&amp;nbsp;... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 14&quot; /&gt; Songs such as &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Because of You&quot; were also inspired by her real life experiences, the former about her relationship with an ex-boyfriend and the latter about her experience after her parents' divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 11&quot; /&gt;

Clarkson shares writing credits on six songs from ''Breakaway''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine 1&quot; /&gt; &quot;Breakaway&quot; was included as the album's opening and title track. She described it as a simple song, and further explained, &quot;I think that it's simplicity is what's beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't even know it was me!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot;, as &quot;not as &quot;smooth&quot; as pop or R&amp;B. Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, &quot;It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;, was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, &quot;I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; The fourth track, &quot;Because of You&quot;, was originally intended for ''Thankful''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Guardian 1&quot; /&gt; Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; &quot;[[Gone (Kelly Clarkson song)|Gone]]&quot;, the fifth track, was written by [[Kara DioGuardi]] and [[John Shanks]]. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; The sixth track, &quot;Addicted&quot;, was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]'' (2003). She remarked, &quot;I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record&amp;nbsp;... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt;

Clarkson co-wrote the seventh track, &quot;Where Is Your Heart&quot;, with DioGuardi and [[Chantal Kreviazuk]]. She revealed that it was also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as &quot;wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; &quot;[[Walk Away (Kelly Clarkson song)|Walk Away]]&quot;, the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by [[Raine Maida]]. Clarkson described it as &quot;one of the brighter songs&quot; on ''Breakaway'',&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 13&quot; /&gt; and said that &quot;It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, &quot;You Found Me&quot;. Clarkson revealed, &quot;When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting at the time that I recorded it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, &quot;I Hate Myself for Losing You&quot;, with [[Jimmy Harry]] and [[Sheppard Solomon|Shep Solomon]]. Clarkson described the song as &quot;depressing&quot;, but felt it could be used as a [[foreshadowing]] device. She explained &quot;I read something that [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; The eleventh track, &quot;Hear Me&quot;, was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, &quot;It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt; The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of &quot;[[Beautiful Disaster (Kelly Clarkson song)|Beautiful Disaster]]&quot;, originally from ''Thankful''. Clarkson admitted that she hated ''Thankful''{{'}}s version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Contactmusic.com 1&quot; /&gt;

== Release and promotion ==
''Breakaway'' was first released in North America on November 30, 2004 by [[RCA Records]], [[19 Recordings]], and [[S Records]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Release - US&quot; /&gt; following an influx of releases by ''American Idol'' contestants Clay Aiken, [[Ruben Studdard]], and Fantasia Barrino.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Hour&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;People Magazine 2&quot; /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist Jeff Leeds noted that the releases could benefit from the holiday season, but &quot;it could also hinder their efforts to establish themselves as recording artists with distinctive personalities and the legitimacy needed for long careers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times 1&quot; /&gt; Clive Davis reiterated that the release was intended to recede from their ties from ''American Idol'', saying, &quot;I'm not interested in merely souvenir sales&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times 1&quot; /&gt; The album was titled ''Breakaway'' to capitalize on the success of the ''The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement'' soundtrack single &quot;Breakaway&quot;, which was also reissued as the album's final single.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 5&quot; /&gt; Immediately before the album was released, Clarkson left [[19 Entertainment|19 Management]], dismissed Fuller as her manager, and quickly hired the managing services of [[Jeff Kwatinetz]] of [[The Firm, Inc.|The Firm]], though still contracted to 19 Recordings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 4&quot; /&gt; A promotion plan was created for Clarkson for ''Breakaway''{{'}}s release. Davis positioned her to be RCA's top global priority, and at the recommendation of The Firm, removed ''American Idol'' from her official biography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine 1&quot; /&gt; Rather than being booked on arenas for her tour, Kwatinetz booked Clarkson for smaller amphitheaters to hone her performance skills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine 1&quot; /&gt; He remarked, &quot;''American Idol'' gave her a lot of exposure that allowed her to skip some steps in her development, and that's hazardous.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine 1&quot; /&gt; ''Breakaway'' was first released internationally on January 3, 2005 by the [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] (now [[Sony Music Entertainment]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Release - AUS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Release - EUR&quot; /&gt; and was released in the United Kingdom on July 18, 2005 by RCA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Release - UK&quot; /&gt; On November 2005, a special edition [[DVD|CD+DVD]] was released, containing additional bonus tracks and music videos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Release - US&quot; /&gt;

Clarkson, along with Studdard and Barrino, hosted a television musical special on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] entitled ''Kelly, Ruben &amp; Fantasia: Home for Christmas'' on November 25, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Globe&quot; /&gt; On the eve of ''Breakaway''{{'}}s release, she performed &quot;[[Since U Been Gone]]&quot; on the ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tonight Show 1&quot; /&gt; On February 2005, she appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' to perform &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Breakaway&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RCA Press Release - Tour&quot; /&gt; On September 2005, she appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and performed &quot;Breakaway&quot; as well as &quot;Because of You&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; /&gt; Clarkson also performed in award ceremonies and events; she performed &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; on the [[2005 MTV Video Music Awards]] at the [[American Airlines Arena]] and on the [[2006 BRIT Awards]] at the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 2&quot; /&gt; She performed &quot;Because of You&quot; on the [[2006 Grammy Awards|48th Annual Grammy Awards]] at the [[Staples Center]] and on the [[Echo (music award)|15th Echo Awards]] at the [[Estrel Hotel|Estrel Berlin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS News 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sony Music 2&quot; /&gt;

The album received positive reviews from music critics. [[AllMusic]] senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], who gave it four out of five stars, wrote &quot;what gives ''Breakaway'' its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off&quot; and describing the tracks as the ones that illustrate Clarkson as a rare thing in the 2000s: &quot;a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Review – AllMusic&quot; /&gt; [[Sputnikmusic]]'s Dave Donnelly gave it a &quot;4&quot; rating, remarking that &quot;''Breakaway'' is not a ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' to her ''[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson album)|Off The Wall]]'' by no means, but she has at least created a rare type of album: a one that offers a full selection of potential singles, reminiscent of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (Michael Jackson album)|Bad]]'' or ''Thriller'', which he described as having a mass appeal with artistic integrity and perceived longevity. ''Breakaway'' may be remembered in years to come as a pop classic, alongside [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s early material perhaps.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Review – Sputnikmusic&quot; /&gt; Raymond Fiore of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album a &quot;B&quot; rating, noting it's rock direction and describing it as &quot;Avril-meets-Evanescence, with a splash of [[Pat Benatar]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Review – Entertainment Weekly&quot; /&gt; Sal Cinquemani of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave ''Breakaway'' a three-and-a-half star rating and commented that &quot;though her rocky leanings were hinted at on the less coherent ''Thankful'', Clarkson had always cited [[Mariah Carey]] as a primary influence and that she still owes a lot to that former powerhouse artist.&quot; Furthering describing it as &quot;what Mariah might sound like if she ever decided to rock out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Review – Slant Magazine&quot; /&gt; Charles Merwin wrote for ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' that the album's probable non-singles still maintain a quality &quot;high enough to quell worries about the &quot;I love the singles, but that's all I really need to hear&quot; arguments.&quot; He described Clarkson as ranking some where at the top of her class as far as rock albums go among the teen pop set, saying that she &quot;has a long way to go before we'll ever feel comfortable calling her anything besides an ''American Idol'', but for now she has a sound that seems believable enough to support her considerable chops.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Review – Stylus Magazine&quot; /&gt; In a quick review, ''Billboard'' described ''Breakaway'' as a &quot;rare exhibition of substance over style&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 5&quot; /&gt;

Some critics, however, were less impressed by the album. Shirley Halperin of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' offered a mixed review by giving the album a three-star rating and saying &quot;Clarkson isn't ready for her new sound.&quot; She asked, &quot;You can't help but wonder, Who is the real Kelly Clarkson, and when will she stop wearing her big sister's hand-me-downs?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Review – Rolling Stone&quot; /&gt; Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave it a two-star rating, saying that &quot;the title track expresses Clarkson's novel desire to &quot;spread my wings and learn to fly&quot;, but settles into a catchy enough rut at times.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Review – The Guardian&quot; /&gt;

=== Commercial performance ===
''Breakaway'' is currently Clarkson's most successful release to date, with sales of over 15 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Universal Music&quot; /&gt; On the week ending December 18, 2004, the album debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart in the United States with 250,000 copies sold,&lt;ref name=&quot;Entertainment Weekly 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 1&quot; /&gt; which were 47,000 less than her first week sales of ''Thankful''.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today 1&quot; /&gt; Music commercial analysts noted that Clarkson's commercial appeal has endured beyond ''American Idol'', but also commented on its slumping performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 1&quot; /&gt; ''Billboard'' director Geoff Mayfield noted the lackluster performance may have been caused by being released in a competitive holiday market.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today 1&quot; /&gt; Despite failing to top the chart, the record stayed on the top twenty of the ''Billboard'' 200 for 61 consecutive weeks,&lt;ref name=&quot;People Magazine 1&quot; /&gt; and became the first title in five years to spend its entire year in the top twenty of the chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 2&quot; /&gt; By the end of 2005, ''Breakaway'' became the year's third best-selling album in the United States, according to [[Nielsen Soundscan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today 2&quot; /&gt; It  was certified [[RIAA certification|6× multi-platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] on May 23, 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;Certtification - RIAA&quot; /&gt; and as of 2014, it has sold over 6,307,000 copies in the United States, becoming her best-selling record in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 2&quot;/&gt;

== Impact ==
Music commercial analysts reported that Clarkson attained a commercial appeal on her own with ''Breakaway'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seattle Times 1&quot; /&gt; despite their initial skepticism of her establishing prominence beyond ''American Idol''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety 1&quot; /&gt; Clive Davis recalled that &quot;with the songs &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;, we were able to take Clarkson to a major seller of albums all over the world where they had never even heard of ''American Idol''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 14&quot; /&gt; According to [[Mediabase]], which monitors radio station airplay in North America, Clarkson was the most played artist on the radio in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mediabase Press Release - Radio&quot; /&gt; David Corey, program director of [[WXKS-FM]], described the feat as &quot;very rare&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Globe 2&quot; /&gt; Just before the release of her third studio album, Davis also stated that she was one of the top four artists at Sony BMG.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; /&gt;

''Billboard'' credits Clarkson for landscaping the core sound of [[pop music|mainstream pop music]] in the 2000s to a [[uptempo]] [[dance-pop|dance-oriented]] sound with the release of &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and the singles that followed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 13&quot; /&gt; The album's producers also came into prominence due to the album's success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 14&quot; /&gt; Dr. Luke, who was the [[Saturday Night Live Band|house band]] lead guitarist for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' at the time of ''Breakaway''{{'}}s release, has credited &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; as his first big break.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR 1&quot; /&gt; Max Martin, who had already found major success as a music producer in the 1990s and early 2000s with, among others, [[Britney Spears]], [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[NSYNC]], achieved more prominence due to the success of &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;STIM&quot; /&gt;

''Breakaway''{{'}}s critical acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, particularly from the [[rock music|rock]] and [[indie music scene]], who had looked down upon ''American Idol'' contestants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Associated Press 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 3&quot; /&gt; In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of ''Breakaway'' had validated ''American Idol'' itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soundtrack of My Life&quot;/&gt; The popularity of &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; among the rock community also resulted in various [[cover version]]s by rock acts, such as [[A Day to Remember]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 4&quot; /&gt; [[Ted Leo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 3&quot; /&gt; and [[Tokyo Police Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; /&gt; Clarkson herself recalled, &quot;It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I was walking around with a friend of mine and this hard-rock guy came up to me and was like, 'I look stupid, but I tell my friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the ''American Idol'' girl.' But they love that song, and it kind of won them over.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV 3&quot; /&gt;
