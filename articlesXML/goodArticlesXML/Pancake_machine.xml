A '''pancake machine''' is an electrically-powered machine that automatically produces cooked [[pancake]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt; It is believed that the earliest known pancake machine was invented in the United States in 1928.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; /&gt; Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies [[Mass production|mass-produce]] pancake machines, and some have been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty pancake machine in 2013 in commemoration of [[Shrove Tuesday|Pancake Day]] in the United Kingdom.

== History ==
In 1928, a man in [[Portland, Oregon]], invented an electric pancake machine that operated by the process of batter being dropped onto a revolving heated [[flattop grill]] from a storage cylinder atop the grill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; /&gt; The grill was heated using electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; /&gt; The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; /&gt;

In 1955 in the United States, an automatic pancake machine was developed by [[Vendo]], which used a specially formulated pancake batter mix that was manufactured by the [[Quaker Oats Company]]'s [[Aunt Jemima]] branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt; The Vendo machine could produce pancakes &quot;in less than three minutes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt; It was a semi-automatic machine that performed all of the cooking functions except for the pouring of the pancake batter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt;

In 1956, four Racine, WI Engineers developed and fabricated two, 5' diameter gas burning pancake machines for the annual
Pancake Day sponsored by the Kiwanis Club there in Racine.

== Types and uses ==
Various types of pancake machines exist, such as those that run pancake [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Association 1986&quot; /&gt; Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt; Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey 2009&quot; /&gt; Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howie 2014 p. 452&quot; /&gt; They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipsey 2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plautz 2014&quot; /&gt; and hotels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel &amp; Leisure&quot; /&gt;

== Homemade pancake machines ==
Homemade versions of pancake machines have been constructed. An example of a homemade pancake machine is one constructed in 1977 by Ken Whitsett of the Ocala Kiwanis Club in Ocala, Florida, which was used for the organization's annual pancake day.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSB 1977&quot; /&gt; The Kiwanis machine utilized a hopper filled with pancake batter that was manually dropped onto a revolving griddle.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSB 1977&quot; /&gt; The pancakes were manually flipped and plated when cooking was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSB 1977&quot; /&gt; It required four people for its operation, and could produce between 750–1000 pancakes per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSB 1977&quot; /&gt;

== Companies and brands ==
Commercial and home-consumer pancake machines are [[Mass production|mass-produced]] by some companies in contemporary times.

=== Commercial products ===
Commercial pancake machines are typically used in the commercial [[foodservice]] and [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]] industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Association 1986&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey 2009&quot; /&gt;

ChefStack is a pancake machine brand that can produce 200 pancakes per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey 2009&quot; /&gt; Individual Pancakes are produced in seconds by this machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey 2009&quot; /&gt; The machine was designed for use in commercial establishments such as cafeterias and convenience stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey 2009&quot; /&gt;

Popcake is a U.S. company that produces Popcake-brand pancake machines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotelier Middle East&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popcake&quot; /&gt; The Popcake machine was invented by Marek Szymanski, and as of July 2014 approximately 7,000 of them are used worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popcake&quot; /&gt; This brand has features that allow users to adjust the size, quantity and doneness level of the pancakes produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipsey 2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popcake2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HuffPost 2013&quot; /&gt; Plates of pancakes are produced in around two minutes time by the Popcake machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipsey 2015&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Consumer products ===
[[File:Electric griddle.jpg|thumb|A basic electric [[griddle]] with temperature control|alt=A basic electric griddle with temperature control]]
Consumer versions of pancake machines for home use are simpler in operation compared to commercial machines, typically involving a basic [[griddle]] and a feature to adjust cooking temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cable 2014&quot; /&gt; Consumer machines are typically countertop-sized [[small appliance]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cable 2014&quot; /&gt; Brands include the [[Severin Elektro|Severin]] Crepe Maker, the [[Cuisinart]] Griddle and Grill, Swan's Come Dine With Me Party Wok and Pancake Maker, the Roller Grill Single Plate Crepe Machine and the Andrew James Crepe Maker, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cable 2014&quot; /&gt; A review of various consumer machines published in ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' recommended various machines per situational uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cable 2014&quot; /&gt; For example, the Roller Grill Single Plate Crepe Machine was recommended for use with large groups of people and the Severin Crepe Maker was recommended for &quot;technophobes&quot; who prefer a simple design&lt;ref name=&quot;Cable 2014&quot; /&gt; The review recommended the Andrew James Crepe Maker as the overall best value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cable 2014&quot; /&gt;

In March 2015 in the U.S., the PancakeBot pancake machine received over $141,000 on [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kindelan 2015&quot; /&gt; Its target donation request on the website was $50,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kindelan 2015&quot; /&gt; PancakeBot can produce custom pancakes in various designs, which is performed by the use of pancake batter in a bottle that is moved by a programmable machine arm atop the griddle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Technology.org&quot; /&gt; The machine utilizes custom software to accomplish this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kindelan 2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Technology.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.technology.org/2015/03/13/pancakebot-pancake-printing-machine-that-inspires-playing-with-your-food/ | title=PancakeBot – pancake printing machine that inspires playing with your food | publisher=Technology.org | date=March 13, 2015 | accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novelty machines ==
In commemoration of [[Shrove Tuesday|Pancake Day]] in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine was built by [[The Happy Egg Company]] in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molloy 2013&quot; /&gt; The machine involves the use of a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molloy 2013&quot; /&gt; After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molloy 2013&quot; /&gt;
