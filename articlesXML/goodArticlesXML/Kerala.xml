'''Kerala''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|r|ə|l|ə}}), historically known as '''Keralam''', is an [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] in [[South India]] on the [[Malabar coast]]. It was formed on 1 November 1956 following the [[States Reorganisation Act]] by combining [[Malayalam]]-speaking regions. Spread over {{convert|38863|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, it is bordered by [[Karnataka]] to the north and northeast, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the east and south, and the [[Lakshadweep Sea]] to the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the [[2011 Census of India|2011 Census]], Kerala is the [[List of states of India by population|thirteenth-largest state by population]] and is divided into 14 [[Districts of India|districts]] with the capital being [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.

The region has been a prominent spice exporter since 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE. The [[Chera Dynasty]] was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala, though it frequently struggled against attacks by the neighbouring [[Chola]]s and [[Pandya]]s. In the 15th century, the [[spice trade]] attracted [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders to Kerala, and paved the way for the European colonisation of India. After [[Independence of India|independence]], [[Travancore]] and [[Cochin]] joined the Republic of India and [[Travancore-Cochin]] was given the status of a state in 1949. In 1956, Kerala state was formed by merging [[Malabar district]], Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern [[taluk]]s), and the taluk of [[Kasargod]], [[South Kanara]].

Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; highest [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), 0.790 in 2011; the highest literacy rate, 93.91% in the 2011 census; the highest life expectancy, 77 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1000 men. The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] during the [[Kerala Gulf diaspora#The Gulf Boom|Gulf Boom]] of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on [[remittances]] from a large [[Malayali]] expatriate community. [[Hinduism]] is practised by more than half of the population, followed by [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. The culture is a synthesis of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryan]] and [[South Indian culture|Dravidian]] cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVsw35oEBv4C|title=A Survey Of Kerala History|last=Menon|first=A. Sreedhara|date=2007-01-01|publisher=DC Books|isbn=9788126415786|page=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.

The production of [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[natural rubber]] contributes significantly to the total national output. In the agricultural sector, [[coconut]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[cashew]] and spices are important. The state's coastline extends for {{convert|595|km|mi}}, and around 1.1&amp;nbsp;million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% to the state's income. The state has the [[Indian states ranking by media exposure|highest media exposure in India]] with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly English and Malayalam. Kerala is one of the prominent [[Tourism in Kerala|tourist destination]]s of India, with [[Kerala Backwaters|backwaters]], beaches, [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic tourism]] and [[tropical]] greenery as its major attractions.

==Etymology==
The name Kerala has an uncertain etymology. &quot;Keralam&quot; may stem from the Classical [[Tamil language|Tamil]] cherive-alam (&quot;declivity of a hill or a mountain slope&quot;) or chera alam (&quot;Land of the Cheras&quot;). While &quot;Kerala&quot; may represent an imperfect [[Malayalam]] portmanteau fusing kera (&quot;coconut palm tree&quot;) and alam (&quot;land&quot; or &quot;location&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateofkerala.in/kerala_facts/kerala_etymology.php|title=KERALA ETYMOLOGY :: STATE OF KERALA :: The Ultimate Destination of Kerala Information|author=Sreelakshmi Suresh|work=stateofkerala.in|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Kerala&quot; can also be derived from the word &quot;Cheral&quot; that refers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings. The word &quot;Cheral&quot; is derived from the Proto-Tamil-Malayalam word for &quot;lake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marr1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John R. Marr|title=The Eight Anthologies: A Study in Early Tamil Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3gOAAAAYAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Institute of Asian Studies|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala is the [[Aitareya Aranyaka]] of the [[Rigveda]]. It is also mentioned in the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], the two Hindu epics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Menon3&quot;/&gt; The word ''Kerala'' is first recorded (as ''Keralaputra'', meaning Cherathala makan or Cheraman) in a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription (Rock Edict 2) left by the [[Maurya empire|Maurya emperor]] [[Ashoka]] (274–237&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerala 2011&quot;&gt;&quot;Kerala.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2011. Web. 26 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription refers to the local ruler as ''Keralaputra'' (Sanskrit for &quot;son of Kerala&quot;); or &quot;son of Chera[s]&quot;. This contradicts a popular theory that its etymology derives &quot;Kerala&quot; from &quot;Kera&quot; (coconut tree in Malayalam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

===Mythology===
[[File:Parshuramsaraswats.jpg|thumb|[[Parashurama|Parasurama]], surrounded by settlers, commanding [[Varuna]] (the [[Hindu]] God of water) to part the seas and reveal Kerala]]

According to [[Hindu]] mythology, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage [[Parasurama]], the sixth [[Daśāvatāra|avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], hence Kerala is also called ''Parasurama Kshetram'' (&quot;The Land of Parasurama&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;S. C. Bhatt, Gopal K. Bhargava (2006) &quot;Land and People of Indian States and Union Territories: Volume 14.&quot;, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from [[Gokarna, India|Gokarna]] to [[Kanyakumari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aiya VN |title=The Travancore State Manual|publisher=Travancore Government Press |pages=210–212 |year=1906 |accessdate=12 November 2007 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RdzaPW-kEvQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King [[Vasuki]], who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with ''[[Keralolpathi]]'', which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as land tenure and administration, to the story of Parasurama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. T. Narayanan|title=Agrarian Relations in Late Medieval Malabar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHtbkuXruzwC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=28 July 2012|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Northern Book Centre|isbn=978-81-7211-135-9|pages=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval times [[Kuttuvan]] may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolise his lordship over it.&lt;ref&gt;P. 204 ''Ancient Indian History'' By Madhavan Arjunan Pillai&lt;/ref&gt;

Another much earlier [[Puranic]] character associated with Kerala is [[Mahabali]], an [[Asura]] and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He won the war against the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord ''Vishnu'', who took his fifth incarnation as ''[[Vamana]]'' and pushed Mahabali down to [[Patala]] (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the [[Onam]] festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rinehart2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Rinehart|title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=28 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-905-8|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Matsya Purana]], among the oldest of the 18 [[Puranas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Ellen|title=The Lord who is Half Woman: Ardhanārīśvara in Indian and Feminist Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUhlxBozntoC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5325-4|page=20|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemmerer|first=Lisa|title=Animals and World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFEL2yjkbAAC&amp;pg=PA78|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-991255-1|page=78|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the [[Malaya Mountains]] of Kerala (and [[Tamil Nadu]]) as the setting for the story of [[Matsya]], the first [[Dashavatara|incarnation]] of Vishnu, and [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], the first man and the king of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalal|first=Roshen|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA250|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|page=250|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ragozin|first=Zenaide A.|title=Vedic India As Embodied Principally in the Rig-veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T16d-eRG5VkC&amp;pg=PA341|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-4463-7|page=341|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient period===

In the 2013–14 fiscal period, the contribution has been estimated at a high of 7.75%. The total growth of the farm sector has recorded a 4.39% increase in 2012–13, over a paltry 1.3% growth in the previous fiscal year.

===Airports===
Kerala has three international airports: [[Trivandrum International Airport]], [[Cochin International Airport]]  and [[Calicut International Airport]]. All civilian airports functioning in the state are international airports, a feature which is unique to Kerala. Upon completion of the [[Kannur International Airport]], Kerala will join Tamil Nadu as the state with the most international airports. Unlike in other states where the capital city has the highest air traffic, in Kerala, air traffic is distributed evenly over Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. Despite this, all these three airports are among the top 15 busiest airports in India.

[[Kollam Airport]], established under the Madras Presidency and closed before the inauguration of Trivandrum International Airport in the capital, was the first airport in Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article252269.ece |title=Aviation school proposal evokes mixed response |work=The Hindu |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trivandrum International Airport, managed by the [[Airport Authority of India]], is among the oldest existing airports in South India. Cochin International Airport is the busiest in the state and the seventh-busiest in the country. It was the first Indian airport to be incorporated as a [[public limited company]]; it was funded by nearly 10,000 [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indians]] from 30 countries. Cochin Airport is the primary hub of [[Air India Express]] and the secondary hub of [[Air Asia India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The three airports in Kerala can be in business without affecting each other |publisher=[[Rediff.com|Rediff]] |date=6 December 1999 |accessdate=11 November 2007 |url=http://www.rediff.com/business/1999/dec/06inter.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than civilian airports, [[Kochi]] has a naval airport named [[INS Garuda]]. Thiruvananthapuram airport shares civilian facilities with the Southern Air Command of the [[Indian Air Force]]. These facilities are used mostly by Central Government VIPs visiting Kerala.

===Water transport===

Kerala has [[Ports in Kerala|one major port, 17 minor ports]] and a few mini ports. The state has numerous [[Kerala backwaters|backwaters]], which are used for commercial [[inland navigation]]. Transport services are mainly provided by country craft and passenger vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commission2008&quot; /&gt; There are 67 navigable rivers in the state while the total length of inland waterways is {{convert|1687|km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;google14&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Government of India Planning Commission|title=Kerala Development Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ul-OkF5gUJQC&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=18 November 2012|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Academic Foundation|isbn=978-81-7188-594-7|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main constraints to the expansion of inland navigation are; lack of depth in waterways caused by silting, lack of maintenance of navigation systems and bank protection, accelerated growth of the [[water hyacinth]], lack of modern inland craft terminals, and lack of a cargo handling system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commission2008&quot; /&gt; A canal {{convert|205|km}} long, [[National Waterway 3 (India)|National Waterway 3]], runs between [[Kottapuram]] and [[Kollam]], which is included in the East-Coast Canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/national-waterway-iii-to-be-opened-today/article1952032.ece|title= National Waterway III to be opened today|first=John|last=Paul|work=The Hindu|accessdate=14 November 2015|date=20 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
The democratic rise of the [[Communist Party of India]] in the state, culminating in the chief ministership of [[EMS Namboodiripad]] and his government, helped to distribute land and implement educational reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia&quot; /&gt; There is the tradition of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother is the head of the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lankina|author2=Tomila V.|author3=Getachew, Lullit|year=2013|url=https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/44929/1/Competitive%20religious%20entrepreneurs%20(lsero).pdf|title=Competitive religious entrepreneurs: Christian missionaries and female education in colonial and post-colonial India|work=British Journal of Political Science|pages=43, 103–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable [[sex ratio]], contributed to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joseph&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Ammu Joseph |editor= Oommen M.A. |year=1999 |title=Rethinking Development: Kerala's Development Experience |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |isbn=978-81-7022-765-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lzV3bQh-L94C |pages=479–486 |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerala's sex ratio of 1.084 is higher than that of the rest of India and is the only state where women outnumber men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tharamangalam_2005&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}} While having the opportunities that education affords them, such as political participation, keeping up to date with current events, reading religious texts etc., these tools have still not translated into full, [[Women's rights|equal rights]] for the women of Kerala. There is a general attitude that women must be restricted for their own benefit. In the state, despite the social progress, gender still influences [[social mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Maddox mentions in: Maddox, Brenda. &quot;A Marxist Paradise For Women?&quot; New Statesman.

[[Adi Shankara]] was a religious philosopher who contributed to Hinduism and propagated the philosophy of [[Advaita]].

The [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts, including [[series expansion]] for trigonometric functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;roy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roy|first=Ranjan|year=1990|title=Discovery of the Series Formula for &amp;pi; by Leibniz, Gregory, and Nilakantha|work=Mathematics Magazine|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|volume=63|issue=5|pages=291–306|doi=10.2307/2690896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pingree | first = David | authorlink = David Pingree | title = Hellenophilia versus the History of Science | year = 1992 | journal = Isis | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 554–563 | jstor = 234257 | doi = 10.1086/356288|quote=One example I can give you relates to the Indian Mādhava's demonstration, in about 1400&amp;nbsp;A.D., of the infinite power series of trigonometrical functions using geometrical and algebraic arguments. When this was first described in English by Charles Whish, in the 1830s, it was heralded as the Indians' discovery of the calculus. This claim and Mādhava's achievements were ignored by Western historians, presumably at first because they could not admit that an Indian discovered the calculus, but later because no one read any more the ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society'', in which Whish's article was published. The matter resurfaced in the 1950s, and now we have the Sanskrit texts properly edited, and we understand the clever way that Mādhava derived the series ''without'' the calculus; but many historians still find it impossible to conceive of the problem and its solution in terms of anything other than the calculus and proclaim that the calculus is what Mādhava found. In this case the elegance and brilliance of Mādhava's mathematics are being distorted as they are buried under the current mathematical solution to a problem to which he discovered an alternate and powerful solution.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the instructions of the [[Wood's despatch]] of 1854, both the princely states, Travancore and Cochin, launched mass education drives with support from agencies, mainly based on castes and communities and introduced a system of [[grant-in-aid]] to attract more private initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devrep53-58&quot; /&gt; The efforts by leaders, [[Ayya Vaikundar|Vaikunda Swami]], [[Narayana Guru]] and [[Ayyankali]], towards aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state, with the help of community-based organisations like [[Nair Service Society]], [[Sree Narayana Trust|SNDP]], Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches, led to the development of mass education in Kerala.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devrep53-58&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Planning Commission, India |title=Kerala Development Report |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ul-OkF5gUJQC |publisher=Academic Foundation |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-7188-594-7 |pages=53–58 |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
