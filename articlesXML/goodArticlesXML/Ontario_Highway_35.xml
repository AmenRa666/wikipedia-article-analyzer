'''King's Highway 35''', also known as '''Highway 35''', is a [[Provincial highways in Ontario|provincial highway]] in the Canadian province of [[Ontario]], linking [[Highway 401]] with [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], [[Kawartha Lakes]], and [[Algonquin Park]]. The highway travels from west of [[Newcastle, Ontario|Newcastle]], through [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]] and [[Kawartha lakes (Ontario)|the Kawarthas]] and into [[Haliburton County, Ontario|Haliburton]] before terminating at [[Ontario Highway 60|Highway 60]] to the west of [[Algonquin Park]], the province's largest. The winding course of the highway, combined with the picturesque views offered along its length, have led some to declare it the most scenic highway in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Most of the highway, including a portion of today's Highway 60, was assumed by the Department of Highways by 1940. In 1961, [[Ontario Highway 115|Highway 115]] was signed concurrently with Highway 35 for {{convert|19|km|0}}. This was widened to a divided expressway in the late eighties. In the mid-1950s, several bypasses were constructed to divert Highway&amp;nbsp;35 away from town centres such as Lindsay, [[Fenelon Falls]] and [[Minden, Ontario|Minden]].

Highway 35 is patrolled along its entirety by the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]. The speed limit for most of the length of the highway is {{convert|80|km/h|0}}, slowing to {{convert|50|km/h|0|abbr=on}} within built-up areas, and increasing to {{convert|90|km/h|0|abbr=on}} when it connects with Highway 115.

For the length of this concurrency, it is a divided four lane expressway with no left turns, known as [[right-in/right-out]] (RIRO). At Enterprise Hill, Highway 35 exits the divided highway (which continues as Highway 115 east to Peterborough) and proceeds north as a two lane road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google maps

The terrain flattens approaching [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], which the highway bypasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCON&quot; /&gt; Between Lindsay and [[Coboconk]], the route is generally straight and crosses through a mix of agricultural lands and forest. After passing through Coboconk, it descends from the flat limestone plateau into the rocky [[Canadian Shield]] south of [[Norland, Ontario|Norland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot; /&gt;
The highway hugs the [[Gull River (Balsam Lake)|Gull River]] north of Norland and cuts through [[granite]] along its route into the [[Haliburton Highlands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 mapart&quot;&gt;{{cite map

After passing [[Minden, Ontario|Minden]], the scenic highway begins diving into valleys and along cliffs overlooking several lakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP&quot; /&gt;

Highway 35 generally follows the former ''Bobcaygeon [[List of Ontario Colonization Roads|Colonization Road]]'' north of Minden, though several realignments over the years have led to its current winding route. At [[Carnarvon, Ontario|Carnarvon]], it meets with [[Ontario Highway 118|Highway 118]].

Heading northward into increasingly mountainous terrain, the highway crosses into [[Muskoka]] near [[Dorset, Ontario|Dorset]], and shortly thereafter reaches its terminus at [[Ontario Highway 60|Highway 60]] west of [[Algonquin Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 mapart&quot; /&gt;

Traffic volumes on Highway&amp;nbsp;35 vary considerably over the length of the highway, as well as over the course of the year due to its use for recreational purposes, including snowmobiling, [[cottaging]] and camping. Along the Highway&amp;nbsp;35 and Highway&amp;nbsp;115 concurrency, the average daily vehicle count is above 20,000. This drops as Highway&amp;nbsp;35 splits off at Enterprise Hill to under 10,000. This volume is fairly consistent as far north as Minden, at which point the vehicle count drops below 5,000 and tapers off as low as 2,000 at Highway&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;ref name=&quot;km&quot; /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:35 near Cameron Lake.png|thumb|left|alt=&quot;A black and white photo of a highway curving gently to the left. A lake occupies most of the background, while several large trees dominate the foreground.&quot;|Highway 35 overlooking [[Cameron Lake (Ontario)|Cameron Lake]] in 1941]]
Highway 35, like many highways that begin at [[Lake Ontario]] and eventually cross into the [[Canadian Shield]], began as several trails connecting settlements.&lt;ref name=&quot;rat&quot;&gt;Suggitt pp.&amp;nbsp;66&amp;ndash;67&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the southern portion of the highway follows various [[concession road|sidelines and concessions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 mapart&quot; /&gt; Between Lindsay and Fenelon Falls, Highway 35 follows the former ''Fenelon Road'', while north of there it follows ''The Cameron Road'', a trail carved in the 1850s between Fenelon and [[Minden, Ontario|Minden]]. North of Minden, the highway generally follows ''The Bobcaygeon Road'', a colonization road built as far north as Dwight in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=&quot;p18&quot; /&gt;

The ''Highway 35'' designation was first applied in 1931 to the road between Lindsay and Fenelon Falls. In 1934 it was extended along the road between Fenelon Falls and Rosedale,&lt;ref name=&quot;hita&quot;&gt;Miller pp.&amp;nbsp;97&amp;ndash;98&lt;/ref&gt;
bringing the length of the highway up to {{convert|38.9|km|1|abbr=on}}. The Department of Northern Development had meanwhile spent the early 1930s upgrading the trails north of the [[Trent&amp;ndash;Severn Canal]] that fell under their jurisdiction. A new road was constructed north of Dorset as part of the Ontario Northern Highways Program,&lt;ref name=&quot;rat&quot; /&gt; avoiding the straight Bobcaygeon Road.&lt;ref name=&quot;p18&quot;&gt;Shragge p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/ref&gt;
The entire route from Rosedale to Huntsville became part of Highway 35 on April 1, 1937 when the Department of Northern Development merged into the Department of Highways,&lt;ref name=&quot;rat&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shragge. p.&amp;nbsp;71&lt;/ref&gt;
adding {{convert|138.4|km|1|abbr=on}} to the route. Finally in 1938, Highway 35 was extended south to Newcastle.&lt;ref name=&quot;hita&quot; /&gt;

[[File:35 Rock cut at Miners Bay.png|thumb|right|Highway 35 passes through several imposing [[rock cuts]] beginning north of [[Norland, Ontario|Norland]]]]
At this point, much of the assumed route was a [[gravel road]]. Only the section south of Orono was paved. The Lindsay to Norland section was paved in the 1940s, and north of that point beginning in 1954. It would take until 1958 for paving to commence south of Lindsay.&lt;ref name=&quot;hita&quot; /&gt;

In 1953, Highway 115 was built as a two lane road eastward from Highway 35 near [[Pontypool, Ontario|Pontypool]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hita&quot; /&gt; It was completed to [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] by 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

but before 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Highways p.&amp;nbsp;77&amp;ndash;78&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1954, several bypasses were constructed around the towns and villages along the route.&lt;ref name=&quot;hita&quot; /&gt;
The first of these was in Minden, bypassing the old route along the Bobcaygeon Road and South Water Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map

This was followed by the bypassing of Fenelon Falls in 1955. Highway 35 followed present day [[Kawartha Lakes Road 121]] and [[Kawartha Lakes Road 8]] into and out of the village until the Seventh Concession Line was paved and the highway rerouted onto it.&lt;ref name=&quot;rat&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map

 | accessdate = June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1956, Newcastle was bypassed and Highway 35 connected directly to the then eastern terminus of Highway 401 west of the village.&lt;ref name=&quot;hita&quot; /&gt; The former route is now [[Durham Regional Road 19]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 mapart&quot; /&gt;
By 1958, construction had begun on several bypasses of Lindsay,&lt;ref name=&quot;1958map&quot;&gt;{{cite map

including the ''Lindsay Bypass'' that Highway 7 and 35 follow today. Prior to the opening of the bypass, Highway 35 followed Lindsay Street to Kent Street and jogged northwest along William Street and Colborne Street. It then followed today's [[Kawartha Lakes Road 4]] north and west to the current intersection with Highway 35. This routing became Highway 35B when the bypass opened in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;hita&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1960map&quot;&gt;{{cite map

Prior to 2007, the highway was extensively rehabilitated between Kawartha Lakes Road 121, near Fenelon Falls and Highway 118 in Carnarvon. This included widening the highway for a third passing lane, as well as the resurfacing of several sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

On the day before [[Remembrance Day]], 2009, the section of Highway&amp;nbsp;35 between Lindsay and Norland was renamed the [[Midland Regiment]] Commemorative Highway, in honour of veterans of World War II.
