'''U.S. Route 50''' ('''US 50''') is a major east–west route of the [[U.S. Highway system]], stretching just over {{convert|3000|mi}} from [[West Sacramento, California|West Sacramento]], [[California]], to [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], [[Maryland]], on the Atlantic Ocean. Until 1972, when it was replaced by [[Interstate Highway]]s west of the Sacramento area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.route50.com/history.htm|title=US50 – History of Highway 50 and Route 50|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it extended (by way of [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], the [[Altamont Pass]], and the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]]) to [[San Francisco, CA|San Francisco]], near the Pacific Ocean. The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route. It generally serves a corridor south of Interstates [[Interstate 70|70]] and [[Interstate 80|80]] and north of Interstates [[Interstate 64|64]] and [[Interstate 40|40]]. The route runs through mostly rural [[desert]] and [[mountain]]s in the [[Western United States]], with the section through [[Nevada]] known as &quot;The Loneliest Road in America&quot;. In the [[Midwest]], US 50 continues through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. The route continues into the Eastern United States, where it passes through the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in [[West Virginia]] before heading through [[Washington, D.C.]] From there, US 50 continues through [[Maryland]] as a high-speed road to Ocean City. Signs at each end give the length as {{convert|3073|mi}}, but the actual distance is slightly less,&lt;ref name=Google/&gt; due to realignments since the former figure was measured. US 50 passes through a total of 12 states; [[California]], Nevada, [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], West Virginia, [[Virginia]], and Maryland, as well as the [[District of Columbia]].

US 50 was created in 1926 as part of the original U.S. Highway system. The original route planned in 1925 ran from [[Wadsworth, Nevada]] east to [[Annapolis, Maryland]] along several [[auto trail]]s including the [[Lincoln Highway]], [[Midland Trail]], and the [[National Old Trails Road]]. The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from [[Sacramento, California]] east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] before rerouting it to [[U.S. Route 6]] in the 1950s. US 50 was extended west from Sacramento to San Francisco in the 1930s, replacing [[U.S. Route 48 (1926)|U.S. Route 48]]; this was reversed in 1964 when [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]] replaced much of the route between the two cities. In addition, US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City prior in 1949, replacing a portion of [[U.S. Route 213]]. US 50 had two split configurations into U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S, one in Kansas and another in Ohio and West Virginia; both of these instances have been removed.

[[Image:Us route 50 nevada.jpg|thumb|upright|left|US 50 in the Nevada desert]]
US 50 begins as a major freeway at its junction with [[Interstate 80]] in [[West Sacramento]] and continues into [[Sacramento]]. The portion of US 50 west of and including its interchange with California's State Highway 99 in Sacramento is also designated, but not signed as, Interstate 305. The signage along this portion of the highway indicates Business Loop I-80 and a portion of the way (2 miles/3.33&amp;nbsp;km) as California State Highway 99. From Sacramento, the highway heads eastward as the [[William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. Memorial Highway]], continuing as a freeway to the [[Gold Country]] foothills, then following the [[American River]] up the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] as a conventional highway, until cresting the Sierras at [[Echo Summit]] and descending to [[Lake Tahoe]], where the highway enters [[Nevada]]. In Nevada, the highway crosses a series of north–south running mountain ranges that break up the Nevada desert which are called [[Basin and Range]]. East of [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], the road enters the heart of the [[Great Basin]], passing by few communities and minimal services, giving it the name &quot;[[Loneliest Road in America]]&quot; until reaching [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;

In Utah, US 50 also passes through desolate, remote areas with few inhabitants. After crossing the [[Confusion Range]] via [[Kings Canyon (Utah)|Kings Canyon]] and the [[House Range]], the road traverses the north shore of the [[endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[Sevier Lake]]. In [[Holden, Utah|Holden]], US 50 shortly overlaps [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]] to cross the [[Pavant Range]]. The road begins a much longer overlap with [[Interstate 70 in Utah|Interstate 70]] in [[Salina, Utah|Salina]] crossing the [[Wasatch Plateau]] and [[San Rafael Swell]] into [[Colorado]]. US 50 leaves I-70 upon entering the state and heads southeast through [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] and into the southern part of Colorado. Once there, the road climbs to its highest elevation of {{convert|11312|ft}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cycling Colorado's Mountain Passes |last=Magsamen |first=Kurt |year=2002 |publisher=Fulcrum Publishing |isbn=1-55591-294-X |page=152 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdWnRHuE5sEC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=US+Highway+50+11312#v=onepage&amp;q=US%20Highway%2050%2011312&amp;f=false |accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the [[Rocky Mountains]] and in [[Monarch Pass]] where it crosses the [[Continental Divide]]. After descending from the Rockies, US 50 passes by [[Royal Gorge]] near Cañon City then joins [[U.S. Route 400]] in [[Granada, Colorado|Granada]] and follows the [[Arkansas River]] into [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;

[[Image:Jefferson Barracks Bridge 1993 flood cropped.jpg|thumb|The [[Jefferson Barracks Bridge]] over the Mississippi River]]
Upon entering Kansas, US 50, [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with US 400, runs along the Arkansas River to [[Dodge City, KS|Dodge City]] where US 50 splits from US 400 and takes a more northerly course. US 50 continues to traverse the farmlands and small towns of the [[Great Plains]] mostly as a straight two-lane road until [[Emporia, KS|Emporia]] where it joins [[Interstate 35]] and splits onto [[Interstate 435 (Kansas-Missouri)|Interstate 435]] to bypass the center of the [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City Area]]. In [[Missouri]], US 50 leaves I-435 for [[Interstate 470 (Missouri)|Interstate 470]] splitting at [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|Lee's Summit]]. US 50 runs as a four-lane [[divided highway]] across the [[Geography of Missouri|Western Plain]] to [[Sedalia, MO|Sedalia]] where it continues as a two-lane road until reaching [[California, Missouri|California, MO]] about 20 miles west of [[Jefferson City, MO|Jefferson City]]. The road continues as a four-lane divided highway into [[Jefferson City, MO|Jefferson City]] where it joins US 63 just south of the Missouri River Bridge.  It continues 12 miles east of Jefferson City to the Osage River where US 63 splits off to the south.  It then continues as a two-lane road as it traverses the northern sections of the [[Ozarks|Ozark Highlands]] east to [[Union, MO|Union]] where it begins an overlap with [[Interstate 44]] which goes through [[Pacific, Missouri|Pacific]]. The routes separate in [[Sunset Hills, MO|Sunset Hills]] where US 50 migrates southeast bypassing [[St Louis, MO|St Louis]] by joining [[Interstate 255 (Illinois-Missouri)|Interstate 255]] to cross [[Mississippi River]] into [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;

In that state, US 50 switches to [[Interstate 64]] before splitting onto its own alignment in eastern [[O'Fallon, IL|O'Fallon]]. It heads east through [[Trenton, IL|Trenton]], [[Breese, IL|Breese]], [[Carlyle, IL|Carlyle]] crossing the [[Kaskaskia River]], [[Salem, IL|Salem]], [[Flora, IL|Flora]] and [[Lawrenceville, IL|Lawrenceville]] to the [[Wabash River]] along a corridor between Interstates [[Interstate 64|64]] and [[Interstate 70|70]]. US 50 enters [[Indiana]] at the Wabash River, bypassing [[Vincennes, IN|Vincennes]] and [[Washington, IN|Washington]] and passing through [[Bedford, IN|Bedford]], [[Seymour, IN|Seymour]], and [[Versailles, IN|Versailles]]. It meets the [[Ohio River]] at [[Aurora, IN|Aurora]], and soon crosses into [[Ohio]], running through downtown [[Cincinnati, OH|Cincinnati]] via [[Fort Washington Way]] ([[Interstate 71]]). The route crosses southern Ohio via [[Hillsboro, OH|Hillsboro]], [[Chillicothe, OH|Chillicothe]], and [[Athens, OH|Athens]], joining the four-lane divided [[Corridor D]] ([[State Route 32 (Ohio)|State Route 32]]) west of Athens. It meets the Ohio River around [[Belpre, OH|Belpre]], and crosses the newer [[Blennerhassett Island Bridge]] (previously crossing the [[Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge]]) into greater [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;

The portion of US 50 from [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]] to [[Winchester, Virginia]] follows the historic [[Northwestern Turnpike]], which crosses the southern tip of [[Garrett County, Maryland]]. From Parkersburg to [[Interstate 79]] east of [[Clarksburg, WV|Clarksburg]], US 50 has been upgraded as part of the four-lane divided [[Corridor D]]. US 50 is a curving two-lane mountain road, east of Clarksburg through [[Grafton, WV|Grafton]], a bit of Maryland, and [[Romney, WV|Romney]] to Winchester. This portion of the road is so curvy that locals claim &quot;you can meet yourself coming&quot;. The land flattens out after the route crosses the [[Blue Ridge Mountain]] east of Winchester, and it follows the old [[Little River Turnpike]] from [[Aldie, VA|Aldie]] to [[Fairfax, VA|Fairfax]] and the newer [[Arlington Boulevard]] to [[Rosslyn, VA|Rosslyn]], where it crosses the [[District of Columbia]] line on the west shore of the [[Potomac River]] and joins [[Interstate 66]] on the [[Roosevelt Bridge (Potomac River)|Roosevelt Bridge]].&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;

Within the District, US 50 immediately exits the freeway onto [[Constitution Avenue]] along the north side of the [[National Mall]] and south of the [[White House]]. After turning north on 6th Street Northwest, it exits the city to the northeast on [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]]. Upon crossing into [[Maryland]], it passes the south end of the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]] and becomes the [[John Hanson Highway]], a freeway to [[Annapolis, MD|Annapolis]]. The portion of this highway east of the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] ([[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]]/[[I-495 (DC)|I-495]]) is also designated, but not signed as, [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|Interstate 595]], and [[U.S. Route 301]] joins from the south at [[Bowie, MD|Bowie]]. The freeway continues beyond Annapolis as the [[Blue Star Memorial Highway (Maryland)|Blue Star Memorial Highway]] which crosses [[Chesapeake Bay]] on the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] and continues to [[Queenstown, MD|Queenstown]]. There the Blue Star Highway continues northeast as US 301, while US 50 turns south, passing through [[Easton, MD|Easton]] to [[Cambridge, MD|Cambridge]], and then east through [[Salisbury, MD|Salisbury]] to [[Ocean City, MD|Ocean City]] on the four-lane divided [[Ocean Gateway]]. US 50 ends near the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Ocean shore]] at Baltimore Avenue ([[Maryland Route 528]] northbound); its westbound beginning is one block to the west, at Philadelphia Avenue (MD 528 southbound).&lt;ref name=Google/&gt;

{{Hatnote|For more details, see the state-specific articles linked in the route description above.}}
Before the creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]] after [[World War II]], US 50 was a major east–west route. Numbered highways in the United States follow a pattern of odd numbers for north–south routes and even numbers for east–west routes, hence the designation of &quot;50&quot; for this route. In the preliminary report, approved by the [[Joint Board on Interstate Highways]] in late 1925, US 50 ran from [[Wadsworth, Nevada]] to [[Annapolis, Maryland]], passing through [[Pueblo, Colorado]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Tipton, Missouri]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;1925 list&quot;&gt;Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]], November 18, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; The route did not directly replace any [[auto trail]], instead combining portions of many into one continuous route. It followed the historic [[Northwestern Turnpike]] across [[West Virginia]], and portions of other historic roads. Major auto trails followed, including the [[Midland Trail]] in part of [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], and parts of [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]]. The [[National Old Trails Road]] ([[Old Santa Fe Trail]]) was designated in [[Kansas]] and  eastern Colorado, and the [[Lincoln Highway]] was constructed in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1926 Rand McNally&quot;&gt;{{cite map |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |title=United States Road Atlas |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/ |edition= |year=1926 |inset= |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most states that had numbered their [[state highway]]s, US 50 followed only one or two numbers across the state.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The following routes were used, mostly shown on the 1926 Rand McNally:
* Nevada: 2
* Utah: 8 (in the east half of the state; the west half was unnumbered)
* Colorado: 6
* Kansas: state highways were not numbered prior to the U.S. Highway system
* Missouri: 12, shown on [[Missouri State Highway Commission]], [http://www.cosmos-monitor.com/mo/hist/maps/etc/map1922-backlin.html Route Map Showing Designated Routes and Numbers], Approved September 19, 1922
* Illinois: 12
* Indiana: 4 and 5; by 1926, a short piece was 41, but this was originally part of 5, shown on the description of the [http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=2980 1917 Indiana State Highway Map] at the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] Libraries
* Ohio: mostly 26; it had been Main Market Route V in the 1910s, shown on 1914, 1915, and 1917 [http://www.dot.state.oh.us/Divisions/TransSysDev/Innovation/Prod_Services/TransMap/Pages/default.aspx Ohio Transportation Maps]
* West Virginia: 1
* Virginia: 36; it had been 6 until the [[1923 renumbering (Virginia)|1923 renumbering]], shown in the [http://www.vahighways.com/route-log/VDOT%20logs/log1918.htm route descriptions as defined by the General Assembly] on January 31, 1918
* Maryland: state highways were not numbered prior to the U.S. Highway system
&lt;/ref&gt;

One major controversy related to the preliminary route of US 50. The through route had been assigned to the [[Old Santa Fe Trail]], while the spur U.S. Route 250 followed the competing [[New Santa Fe Trail]] to the south. As a compromise, the [[Joint Board on Interstate Highways]] approved a split configuration—[[U.S. Route 50N (Kansas)|U.S. Route 50N]] and [[U.S. Route 50S (Kansas)|U.S. Route 50S]]—in January.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA planning&quot;&gt;Richard F. Weingroff, [http://wwwcf.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/numbers.cfm From Names to Numbers: The Origins of the U.S. Numbered Highway System]&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem was in western Utah, where no improved road existed for US 50 to use. The final numbering plan, approved in November 1926, left a gap in US 50 between [[Ely, Nevada]] and [[Thistle, Utah]].

The gap in Utah was soon bypassed by taking US 50 to the north, crossing the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]] with [[U.S. Route 40 in Utah|U.S. Route 40]] to [[Salt Lake City, UT|Salt Lake City]], and using long portions of [[U.S. Route 93 in Nevada]] and [[U.S. Route 89 in Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nevada Department of Highways]], [http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,459 Road Map], 1932&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. Route 6]] was marked along the direct, but still partially unimproved, route in 1937; it was finally paved in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;Richard F.

The north–south split in Kansas was eliminated in the late 1950s, with the south route—which was to be US 250—becoming part of US 50, and most of US 50N becoming part of a new [[U.S. Route 56]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp KDOT Historic State Maps], 1956 and 1957–1958&lt;/ref&gt; Another split was located between [[Athens, Ohio]] and [[Ellenboro, West Virginia]] from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s, when US 50 went back to its original southern route; that [[U.S. Route 50N (Ohio-West Virginia)|U.S. Route 50N]] is now [[Ohio State Route 550]] and part of [[West Virginia Route 16]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot.state.oh.us/techservsite/availpro/GIS_Mapping/mrsid/default.htm Ohio Transportation Maps], 1928 to 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

At its west end, US 50 was extended south from Sacramento along [[U.S. Route 99]] to [[Stockton, CA|Stockton]] and west to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], replacing [[U.S. Route 48 (California)|U.S. Route 48]], by the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rand McNally &amp; Company]], [http://members.cox.net/mkpl2/hist/hist.html 1933 maps of California]&lt;/ref&gt; US 50 was officially cut back to Sacramento in the [[1964 renumbering (California)|1964 renumbering]], replaced by [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]],&lt;ref&gt;California Streets and Highways Code, 1963: &quot;Route 50 is from Route 80 in Sacramento to the Nevada state line near Lake Tahoe via Placerville.

Prior to the bridge opening, US 50 used a ferry across the Chesapeake Bay between [[Sandy Point, Maryland|Sandy Point]] and [[Matapeake, Maryland|Matapeake]] and followed present-day [[Maryland Route 8]] between Matapeake and [[Stevensville, Maryland|Stevensville]] before continuing east.&lt;ref name=&quot;MD 1949 map&quot;&gt;{{Maryland road map|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;
