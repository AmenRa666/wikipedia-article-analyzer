The '''Mac Pro''' line is a series of [[Xeon|Intel Xeon]]–based [[workstation]] and [[Server (computing)|server]] computers manufactured by [[Apple Inc.]] The Mac Pro, in most configurations and in terms of speed and performance, is the most powerful computer that Apple offers. It is the high-end model of the three desktop computers in the current [[Macintosh|Mac]] lineup, the other two being the [[iMac]] and [[Mac Mini]].

The first-generation Mac Pro has a rectangular tower case which outwardly resembles the last version of the [[Power Mac G5]], and has similar expansion capabilities.  The first Mac Pro has dual [[Dual-Core Xeon|Dual-core]] Xeon [[Woodcrest (microprocessor)|Woodcrest]] processors. It was replaced by a dual [[Quad-Core Xeon|Quad-core]] Xeon [[Clovertown (microprocessor)|Clovertown]] model on  April 4, 2007, and again on January 8, 2008 by a dual Quad-core Xeon [[Harpertown (microprocessor)|Harpertown]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/04/04/apple.8.core.mac.pro/ |publisher=MacNN |title=Apple adds 8-core option to Mac Pro |date=April 4, 2007 |author=Electronista Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Mac Pro is largely based on a model that was announced on July 27, 2010. It features [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]]/[[Westmere (microarchitecture)|Westmere]] architecture Intel Xeon processors. These CPUs offer optionally twelve processing cores. The machine itself at its most evolved is able to accommodate up to four 2 TB hard disk drives or 512 GB solid state drives, as well as the ATI Radeon HD 5770/5870 [[GPU]] units, one per slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/07/27macpro.html | type = press release | title = Apple Unveils New Mac Pro With Up to 12 Processing Cores | publisher = Apple | date = July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second-generation design of Mac Pro was announced at the 2013 [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) opening keynote on June 10, 2013. Apple states that the new Mac Pro achieves twice the overall performance of the last model.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/06/at-long-last-apple-announces-new-mac-pro-with-cylindrical-design/ | title=At long last! Apple announces new Mac Pro with cylindrical design |date=June 10, 2013 | accessdate = June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redesigned Mac Pro takes up less than one eighth the volume of immediately previous model, being shorter ({{convert|9.9|in|cm}}), thinner ({{convert|6.6|in|cm}}) and less massive ({{convert|11|lb|kg}}). The machine supports one central processing unit (CPU) (up to a 12-core Xeon E5 [[CPU]]), four 1866&amp;nbsp;MHz DDR3 slots, dual AMD FirePro D series GPUs (up to D700 with 6&amp;nbsp;GB [[VRAM]] each), and PCIe-based flash storage.  There is updated wireless communication and support for six displays.  Reviews have been generally positive, with caveats.

==1st generation==
[[File:Mac Pro Side.svg|thumb|The first generation of the Mac Pro featured an aluminium case that was similar to that of the Power Mac G5, with the exception of an additional optical drive bay, and a new arrangement of [[Computer port (hardware)|I/O ports]] on both the front and the back.]]
Apple stated that an Intel-based replacement for the [[PowerPC]]-based Power Mac G5 machines had been expected for some time before the Mac Pro was formally announced on August 7, 2006 at the annual [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC).&lt;ref&gt;keynote presentation at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC), August 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source | date=September 2014}} The [[iMac]], [[Mac Mini]], [[MacBook]], and [[MacBook Pro]] had moved to an Intel-based [[CPU architecture|architecture]] starting in January 2006, leaving the Power Mac G5 as the only machine in the Mac lineup still based on the [[PowerPC]] processor architecture Apple had used since 1993. Apple had dropped the term &quot;Power&quot; from the other machines in their lineup, and started using &quot;Pro&quot; on their higher-end laptop offerings. As such, the name &quot;Mac Pro&quot; was widely used before the machine was announced.&lt;ref name=&quot;promacs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bangeman |first=Eric |url= http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2006/07/promacs.ars |title=Peering inside the aluminum ball: Woodcrest, Conroe, and the 'pro' Macs |publisher=Arstechnica |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Mac Pro is in the [[Unix]] workstation market.&lt;ref name=&quot;unix&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix/history_timeline.html|title=The Unix System&amp;nbsp;— History and Timeline|date=January 29, 2003|publisher=Unix.org|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the high-end technical market has not traditionally been an area of strength for Apple, the company has been positioning itself as a leader in [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear digital editing]] for [[high-definition video]], which demands storage and memory far in excess of a general desktop machine.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Additionally, the [[codec]]s used in these applications are generally [[CPU bound|processor intensive]] and highly [[thread (computer science)|threadable]], which Apple's ProRes whitepaper describes as scaling almost linearly with additional [[Microprocessor core|processor cores]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Apple's previous machine aimed at this market, the Power Mac G5, has up to two dual-core processors (marketed as &quot;Quad-Core&quot;), but lacks the storage expansion capabilities of the newer design.&lt;ref name=&quot;promacs&quot; /&gt;

Original marketing materials for the Mac Pro generally referred to the middle-of-the-line model with 2 × dual-core 2.66&amp;nbsp;GHz processors. Previously, Apple featured the base model with the words &quot;starting at&quot; or &quot;from&quot; when describing the pricing, but the online US [[Apple Store (online)|Apple Store]] listed the &quot;Mac Pro at $2499&quot;, the price for the mid-range model. The system could be configured at US$2299, much more comparable with the former base-model dual-core G5 at US$1999, although offering considerably more processing power. Post revision, the default configurations for the Mac Pro includes one quad-core Xeon 3500 at 2.66&amp;nbsp;GHz or two quad-core Xeon 5500s at 2.26&amp;nbsp;GHz each.&lt;ref name=&quot;usstore&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/mac_pro|title=Mac Pro page at Apple's online store|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like its predecessor, the Power Mac G5, the pre-2013 Mac Pro was Apple's only desktop with standard expansion slots for [[video card|graphics adapters]] and other expansion cards.

Apple received criticism after an incremental upgrade to the Mac Pro line following the 2012 [[WWDC]]. The line received more default memory and increased processor speed but still used Intel's older Westmere-EP processors instead of the newer E5 series.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Foresman, [http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/06/mac-pro-gets-minor-update-with-standard-12-core-option-no-xeon-e5/ &quot;Mac Pro gets minor update with standard 12-core option, no Xeon E5&quot;], ''ArsTechnica'', June 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The line also lacked then-current technologies like [[SATA]] III, USB 3, and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], the last of which had been added to every other Macintosh at that point. An email from Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] promised a more significant update to the line in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Kahn, [http://9to5mac.com/2012/06/12/andy-hertzfeld-the-only-thing-thats-still-high-end-about-mac-pro-is-the-bloated-price/ &quot;Andy Hertzfield: The only thing that’s still high-end about Mac Pro is the bloated price&quot;], ''9to5 Mac'', June 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Apple stopped shipping the first-generation Mac Pro in Europe on March 1, 2013 after an amendment to a safety regulation left the professional Mac non-compliant. The last day to order was February 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Haslam, [http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/news/?newsid=3423807 &quot;Apple confirms it will cease shipping Mac Pro in Europe on 1 March&quot;], ''MacWorld'', January 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation Mac Pro was removed from Apple's online store following unveiling of the redesigned second generation Mac Pro at a media event on October 22, 2013.

===CPU===
The 2010 and later Mac Pro systems were available with one or two [[central processing unit]]s (CPU) with options giving four, six, eight, or twelve [[Microprocessor core|cores]].  As an example, the eight core standard configuration Mac Pro uses two Quad core ×8 Intel E5620 Xeon CPUs at 2.4&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]],&lt;ref name=&quot;usstore&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=47925 |title=Intel Xeon Processor E5620 (12 MB Cache, 2.40 GHz, 5.86 GT/s Intel QPI) |publisher=Intel |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but could be configured with two [[Hexa Core]] Intel Xeon X5670 CPUs at 2.93&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=47920 |title=Intel Xeon Processor X5670 (12M Cache, 2.93 GHz, 6.40 GT/s Intel QPI) |publisher=Intel |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Section hidden, there is no current Mac Pro of this design anymore, and no source when there features were added to the line --- All current Mac Pros have CPUs supporting Hyper-Threading which allows two threads to run on each core.  The four core versions came with 8 [[megabyte#base 2 definition|MB]] of Intel Smart cache (L3 cache) while all others come with 12 [[megabyte#base 2 definition|MB]] for each processor.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAM&quot;&gt;Sizes of transistorized memory, such as RAM and cache, are binary values whereby 1&amp;nbsp;MB = 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; (1,048,576) bytes and 1&amp;nbsp;GB = 2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; (1,073,741,824) bytes.&lt;/ref&gt; All current Mac Pro CPUs have Intel's [[Intel Turbo Boost|Turbo Boost]] technology, which dynamically [[overclock|boosts the clock rate]] of a core in intervals of 133&amp;nbsp;MHz if the CPU temperature is below average conditions. --&gt;Since the CPUs are socketed, the CPUs can be removed and replaced with compatible 64-bit Intel Xeon CPUs.

===Memory===
The original Mac Pro's [[main memory]] uses 667&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] [[ECC memory|ECC]] [[FB-DIMM]]s; the early 2008 model uses 800&amp;nbsp;MHz [[ECC RAM|ECC]] [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] FB-DIMMS, the 2009 and onward Mac Pro use 1066&amp;nbsp;MHz [[DDR3]] ECC [[DIMM]]s for the standard models, and 1333&amp;nbsp;MHz [[DDR3]] ECC DIMMs for systems configured with 2.66&amp;nbsp;GHz or faster CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/macpro/specs.html |title=Mac Pro – Technical Specifications |publisher=Apple |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original and 2008 models, these modules are installed in pairs, one each on two [[riser card]]s. The cards have 4 DIMM slots each, allowing a total of 32&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte#base 2 definition|GB]] of memory (8 × 4&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte#base 2 definition|GB]]) to be installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Mac+Pro+%284%2Dcore%29 |title=Computer memory upgrades for Apple Mac Pro (4-core) Desktop/PC from Crucial.com|publisher=Crucial.com|accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, due to its FB-DIMM architecture, installing more RAM in the Mac Pro will improve its memory bandwidth, but may also increase its memory latency.&lt;ref name=&quot;FB-DIMM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2811&amp;p=4|publisher=[[AnandTech]]|title=Understanding FB-DIMMs}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a simple installation of a single FB-DIMM, the peak [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] is 8&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte#base 10 definition|GB]]/s, but this can increase to 16&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte#base 10 definition|GB]]/s by installing two [[FB-DIMM]]s, one on each of the two buses, which is the default configuration from Apple. While electrically the FB-DIMMs are standard, for pre-2009 Mac Pro models Apple specifies larger-than-normal heatsinks on the memory modules. Problems have been reported by users who have used third party RAM with normal size FB-DIMM heatsinks.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2006/8/11/4954|publisher=Ars Technica|title=Mac Pro Memory Issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Mac Pro#Hardware|notes]] below). 2009 and later Mac Pro computers do not require memory modules with heatsinks.

===Hard drives===
[[Image:MacProHarddisk.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of a Mac Pro's hard drive tray.]]
The Mac Pro had room for four internal 3.5&quot; [[Serial ATA|SATA-300]] [[hard drive]]s in four internal &quot;bays&quot;. The hard drives were mounted on individual trays (also known as &quot;sleds&quot;) by captive screws. A set of four drive trays was supplied with each machine. Adding hard drives to the system did not require cables to be attached as the drive was connected to the system simply by being inserted into the corresponding drive slot. A case lock on the back of the system locked the disks trays into their positions.
The Mac Pro also supported [[Serial ATA]] solid-state drives ([[SSD]]) in the 4 hard drive bays via an SSD-to-hard drive sled adapter (mid-2010 models and later), and by third-party solutions for earlier models (e.g., by an adapter/bracket which plugged into an unused [[PCIe]] slot). Various 2.5-inch SSD drive capacities and configurations were available as options.
The Mac Pro was also available with an optional hardware [[RAID]] card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apple Computer, Inc. |url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/03/03macpro.html |title=Apple Introduces New Mac Pro, Press Release March 3, 2009 |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of a [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]] controller card or SAS [[RAID]] controller card, SAS drives could be directly connected to the system's [[SATA]] ports.
Two optical [[drive bay]]s were provided, each with a corresponding SATA port and an [[AT Attachment|Ultra ATA/100]] port.
The Mac Pro had one [[Parallel ATA|PATA]] port and could support two PATA devices in the optical drive bays. It had a total of six SATA ports&amp;nbsp;– four were connected to the system's drive bays, and two were not connected. The extra SATA ports could be put into service through the use of after-market extender cables to connect internal optical drives, or to provide [[eSATA]] ports with the use of an eSATA bulkhead connector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newertech.com/products/esata_cable.php |title=NewerTech eSATA Extender Cable |publisher=Newertech.com |date=January 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the two extra SATA ports were unsupported and disabled under [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]].
A built-to-order Mac Pro could be configured with up to 8&amp;nbsp;[[terabyte|TB]] of storage (4 × 2 TB disks) or 2 TB (4 × 512 GB [[SSD]]).

===Expansion cards===
The 2008 model had two PCI Express (PCIe) 2.0 expansion slots and two PCI Express 1.1 slots, providing them with up to 300&amp;nbsp;[[watt|W]] of power in total. The first slot was double wide and intended to hold the main [[video card]], arranged with an empty area the width of a normal card beside it to leave room for the large [[Computer cooling|coolers]] modern cards often use. In most machines, one slot would be blocked by the cooler. Instead of the tiny screws typically used to fasten the cards to the case, in the Mac Pro a single &quot;bar&quot; held the cards in place, which is itself held in place by two &quot;captive&quot; [[Thumbscrew (fastener)|thumbscrews]] that can be loosened by hand without tools and will not fall out of the case.
On the original Mac Pro introduced in August 2006, the PCIe slots can be configured individually to give more [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to devices that require it, with a total of 40 &quot;lanes&quot;, or 13&amp;nbsp;GB/s total [[throughput]]. When running [[Mac OS X]], the Mac Pro did not support [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sli&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_pro/faq/mac-pro-support-pc-video-cards-sli-crossfire.html|title=Does the Mac Pro support standard PC video cards? Does it support SLI or Crossfire?|publisher=EveryMac|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; limiting its ability to use the latest &quot;high-end gaming&quot; [[video card]] products; however, individuals have reported success with both CrossFire and SLI installations when running [[Windows XP]], as SLI and CrossFire compatibility is largely a function of [[software]].
The bandwidth allocation of the PCIe slots can be configured via the Expansion Slot Utility included with Mac OS X only on the August 2006 Mac Pro. The Early-2008 and later Mac Pros had PCIe slots hardwired as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! !! Early 2008 !! Early 2009, Mid 2010, Mid 2012
|-
| Slot 4 || 4× [[PCI_Express#PCI_Express_1.1|PCIe Gen. 1.1]] || 4× [[PCI_Express#PCI_Express_2.0|PCIe Gen. 2]]
|-
| Slot 3 || 4× [[PCI_Express#PCI_Express_1.1|PCIe Gen. 1.1]] || 4× [[PCI_Express#PCI_Express_2.0|PCIe Gen. 2]]
|-
| Slot 2 || 16× [[PCI_Express#PCI_Express_2.0|PCIe Gen. 2]] || 16× [[PCI_Express#PCI_Express_2.0|PCIe Gen. 2]]
|-
| Slot 1 (Double-Wide) ||  16× [[PCI_Express#PCI_Express_2.0|PCIe Gen. 2]] || 16× [[PCI_Express#PCI_Express_2.0|PCIe Gen. 2]]
|}

===External connectivity===
[[Image:Backside Mac Pro vs Power Mac G5.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|The backs of a Power Mac G5 (left) and a Mac Pro (right) show the differences in arrangement. Note the dual fans on the Power Mac and the single fan on the Mac Pro as well as the new I/O port arrangement.]]
For external connectivity, the Mac Pro included five [[USB 2.0]] ports, two [[FireWire 400]] and two [[FireWire 800]] (Late 2006 until Early 2008), respectively four FireWire 800 (Early 2009 until Mid 2012) ports. [[Computer networking|Networking]] was supported with two built-in [[Gigabit Ethernet]] ports. [[802.11]]&amp;nbsp;a/b/g/n [[Wi-Fi]] support ([[AirPort Extreme]]) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, whereas in the 2010 model and later Wi-Fi was standard. [[Bluetooth]] also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more [[PCIe]] graphics cards. More recent cards featured two [[Mini DisplayPort]] connectors and one dual-link [[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card [[Video memory|graphics memory]] available.
Digital ([[TOSLINK|TOSlink]] optical) audio and analog 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm stereo [[mini jack]]s for sound in and out were included, the latter becoming available on both the front and back of the case.
Unlike other Mac computers, the Mac Pro did not include an [[infrared]] receiver (required to use the [[Apple Remote]]). In [[Mac OS X Leopard]], [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] could be accessed on the Mac Pro (and other Macs) using the [[Command key|Command]] (⌘)-[[Esc key|Escape]] [[keystroke]].

===Case===
[[Image:Side Power Mac G5 - Mac Pro.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|A comparison of the internals of the Power Mac G5 (left) and the Mac Pro (right).]]
From 2006 through 2012, the exterior of the Mac Pro's aluminum case was very similar to that of the Power Mac G5, with the exception of an additional optical drive bay, and a new arrangement of [[Computer port (hardware)|I/O ports]] on both the front and the back. The G5 has the added feature of plastic covering that protects the internal hardware. You can also remove the exterior covering to display the interior, as the plastic will keep everything inside protected.
. The case could be opened by operating a single lever on the back, which unlocked one of the two sides of the machine, as well as the [[drive bays]]. All of the [[expansion slots]] for memory, PCIe cards and drives could be accessed with the side panel removed and no tools were required for installation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.combonews.ru/masterskaya/2043-razbiraem-apple-macpro.html Inside Apple Mac Pro (RUS)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Xeon]] processors generated much less heat than the previous dual-core [[PowerPC G5|G5s]], so the size of the internal cooling devices had been reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room at the top of the [[Computer case|case]] and doubling the number of internal [[drive bay]]s.

===Operating systems===
The Mac Pro comes with [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]] 1.1, a successor to Apple's use of [[Open Firmware]] and the wider industry's use of [[BIOS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uefi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefi.org/about/|title=Overview|publisher=uefi.org|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] provides BIOS backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. These operating systems are installable on [[Intel x86]] based Apple computers:&lt;ref name=&quot;bootcamp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.onmac.net/index.php/Triple_Boot_via_BootCamp |title=Triple Boot via BootCamp |publisher=Wiki.onmac.net |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Mac OS X]] [[Mac OS X Tiger|10.4.7]] and later
*[[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows XP|XP]], [[Windows Vista|Vista]], and [[Windows 7]] [[32-bit Windows|32-bit]] &amp; [[64-bit Windows|64-bit]] (hardware drivers are included in Boot Camp)
*Other x86 operating systems such as [[Linux| Linux x86]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[BSD]]

This is made possible by the presence of an x86 Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS [[Emulation (computing)|emulation]] which Apple has provided on top of EFI.&lt;ref name=&quot;bootcamp&quot; /&gt; Installing any additional [[operating system]] other than Windows is not supported directly by Apple.&lt;ref name=&quot;bootcamp&quot; /&gt; Though Apple's Boot Camp drivers are only for Windows, it is often possible to achieve full or nearly full compatibility with another OS by using third-party [[Device driver|drivers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bootcamp&quot; /&gt;

===Reception===
{{expand section | date=September 2014}}
Ars Technica reviewed the 2006 Mac Pro, rating it 9 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://arstechnica.com/apple/2006/08/macpro/|publisher=Ars Technica|title= Mac Pro review, 9 out of 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2nd generation==
[[File:Mac Pro 2013 inside.png|thumb|Mac Pro Late 2013 edition with its aluminum cylinder cover removed, as shown at the [[WWDC 2013]]]]
Apple Senior Vice President of Marketing [[Phil Schiller]] presented a &quot;sneak peek&quot; of the completely redesigned Mac Pro during the 2013 [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] keynote. The video revealed an overhauled case design, a polished reflective aluminum cylinder built around a central thermal dissipation core and vented by a single fan, which pulls air from under the case, through the core, and out the top of the case. Apple states that the second generation Mac Pro achieves twice the performance of the last model.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica.com&quot;/&gt; The model is assembled in Austin, Texas, on a highly automated line.&lt;ref name=MacProAutomatedLine&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|title=A US-made Mac Pro is a token gesture - CNET|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/a-us-made-mac-pro-is-a-token-gesture/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apple released the new Mac Pro on December 19, 2013.

===Hardware===
The redesigned Mac Pro occupies less than one eighth the volume of immediately previous model, being shorter ({{convert|9.9|in|cm}}), thinner ({{convert|6.6|in|cm}}) and lighter ({{convert|11|lb|kg}}). It supports one central processing unit (CPU) (up to a 12-core Xeon E5 [[CPU]]), four 1866&amp;nbsp;MHz DDR3 slots, dual AMD FirePro D series GPUs (up to D700 with 6&amp;nbsp;GB [[VRAM]] each), and PCIe-based flash storage.  There is a 3x [[MIMO]] antenna system for the unit's [[802.11ac]] [[WiFi]] networking interface, [[Bluetooth|Bluetooth 4.0]] to facilitate close-range wireless functions such as music transfer, keyboards, mice, tablets, speakers, security, cameras, and printers. The system can simultaneously support six [[Apple Thunderbolt Display]]s, or three [[4K resolution]] [[computer monitor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mac Pro specs at Apple&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Mac_Pro_desktop.jpeg|230px|thumb|right]]
The second generation Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]]. It has a [[HDMI 1.4]] port, dual [[Gigabit Ethernet]] ports, six [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt 2]] ports, four [[USB 3]] ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / [[Analog signal|analog]] 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm stereo mini jack for sound out, as well as a dedicated headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no Sound in port; the system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can support up to three simultaneous [[4K resolution|4K display]]s. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel is illuminated when the unit senses it has been moved to make it easier for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated [[digital audio]] in/out ports, a [[SuperDrive]], DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six [[Thunderbolt 2]] ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mac Pro specs at Apple&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/specs|title=Mac Pro — Tech  Specs|accessdate=September 14, 2014|work=Apple.com|publisher=[[Apple, Inc.]]|location=[[Cupertino, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's website mentions only [[RAM]] as user-serviceable, though third party tear-downs show nearly all components can be removed and replaced. A lock switch on the aluminum casing allows for easy access to the internals, as well as fitting a security lock with its own cable, and components are secured with standard screws. The flash storage and GPUs use proprietary connectors and are specially sized to fit into the enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac+Pro+Late+2013+Teardown/20778 &quot;iFixit Mac Pro Late 2013 Teardown&quot;], ''iFixit''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the rest of the Macintosh line the [[CPU]] is not soldered to the logic board and can be replaced with another [[LGA 2011]] socket processor, including processor options not offered by Apple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.macsales.com/22188-owc-confirms-mac-pro-2013-processor-upgradeable &quot;OWC Confirms Mac Pro 2013 Processor Upgradeable&quot;], Other World Computing, January 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The type of RAM modules that Apple supplies with the late-2013 Mac Pro are either [[ECC memory|ECC]] {{em|unbuffered}} ([[Registered memory|UDIMM]]) on the up to 8&amp;nbsp;GB modules (shown on each module as ''PC3-14900'''E'''''). The optional 16&amp;nbsp;GB modules are ECC {{em|registered}} ([[RDIMM]]) modules (shown on each module as ''PC3-14900'''R''''').  The higher-capacity 32&amp;nbsp;GB modules that some third-party vendors offer are also RDIMM.  The UDIMM and RDIMM module types cannot be mixed.

===Reception===

Reception of the new design has been generally positive, at times with caveats. The performance has been widely lauded, especially handling video tasks on the dual GPU units, with some reviewers noting the ability to apply dozens of filters to realtime [[4K resolution|4K resolution video]] in [[Final Cut Pro X]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcp.co/final-cut-pro/articles/1307-the-first-24-hours-with-apple-s-new-mac-pro-and-final-cut-pro-10-1&lt;/ref&gt; Drive performance, connected via [[PCIe]], is also widely mentioned as a strong point. Technical reviewers praised the [[OpenCL]] API under which the machine's powerful twin GPUs and its multi-core CPU can be treated as a single pool of computing power.  However, in late 2013 through early 2014, some reviewers have noted the lack of internal expandability, second CPU, serviceability, and questioned the then-limited offerings via [[Thunderbolt 2]] ports.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ackerman, [http://reviews.cnet.com/apple-mac-pro/ &quot;Apple's radically remained Mac Pro is a powerhouse performer&quot;], ''cnet'', December 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bray, [http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/desktops/386710/mac-pro-late-2013 &quot;Mac Pro (late 2013) review&quot;], ''PC Pro UK'', January 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mac Pro Server==
On November 5, 2010, Apple introduced the Mac Pro Server, which officially replaced the [[Xserve]] line of Apple [[Server (computing)|servers]] as of January 31, 2011. The Mac Pro Server includes an unlimited&lt;ref name=&quot;usstore&quot; /&gt; [[Mac OS X Server]] license and an Intel Xeon 2.8&amp;nbsp;GHz Quad-Core processor, with 8 GB of DDR3 RAM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple Announces Mac Pro Server&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://mashable.com/2010/11/05/mac-pro-server/ | title = Apple Announces Mac Pro Server | publisher = [[Mashable]] | first = Blake | last = Robinson | date = November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mid-2012, the Mac Pro Server was upgraded to an Intel Xeon 3.2&amp;nbsp;GHz Quad-Core processor.  The Mac Pro Server was discontinued on October 22, 2013, with the introduction of the second-generation Mac Pro. However, the [[OS X Server]] software package can be purchased from the Mac App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/osx/server/|title=OS X Server|accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
