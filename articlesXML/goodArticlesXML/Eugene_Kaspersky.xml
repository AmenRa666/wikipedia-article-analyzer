}}'''Eugene Kaspersky''' (born '''Yevgeny Valentinovich Kaspersky''') is a Russian [[cybersecurity]] expert and the CEO of [[Kaspersky Lab]], an IT security company with 3,000 employees. He cofounded Kaspersky Lab in 1997 and helped identify instances of government-sponsored [[cyberwarfare]] as the head of research. He has been an advocate for an international treaty prohibiting cyberwarfare. There is a debate about whether Kaspersky's views and security research show favoritism towards Russian political interests.  

Kaspersky was born in 1965 in [[Novorossiysk, Russia]]. He graduated from the [[Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science]] in 1987 with a degree in mathematical engineering and computer technology. His interest in IT security began when his work computer was infected with the Cascade virus in 1989 and he developed a program to remove it. Kaspersky helped grow Kaspersky Lab through security research and salesmanship. He became the CEO in 2007.

At the age of 16, Kaspersky entered a five-year program with the [[Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science]],&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt; which was sponsored by the Russian military and KGB.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt; At-the-time, the most prestigious schools in Russia for mathematicians were KGB sponsored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mlot 2015&quot;/&gt; He graduated in 1987&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt; with a degree in mathematical engineering and computer technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;seven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt; After graduating college, Kaspersky served the Russian military&lt;ref name=&quot;twentyone&quot;/&gt; as a software engineer.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;/&gt; He met his first wife [[Natalya Kaspersky]] at Severskoye, a KGB vacation resort, in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt;

==Kaspersky Lab==

===Origins===
Eugene Kaspersky's interest in IT security began in 1989, when his PC was infected by the [[Cascade virus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;/&gt; while working for the [[Ministry of Defense]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schofield 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Schofield | first=Jack | title=The Russian defence against global cybercrime | newspaper=the Guardian | date=31 January 2008 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jan/31/eugene.kaspersky | accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied how the virus worked&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt; and developed a program to remove it.&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt; Afterwards he continually found new viruses and developed software to remove them, as a hobby.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;/&gt; Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt;

In 1991, Kaspersky was granted an early release from his military service&lt;ref name=&quot;twentyone&quot;/&gt; and left the defense ministry to take a job at the Information Technology Center of a private company KAMI, in order to work on his antivirus product full-time.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;/&gt; There, he and his colleagues improved the software&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt; and released it as a product called Antiviral Toolkit Pro in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;/&gt; At first the software was purchased by about ten clients per month. It earned about $100 per month, mostly from companies in Ukraine and Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt; Kaspersky's then-future wife Natalya Kaspersky became his coworker at KAMI.&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;/&gt;

In 1994, [[Hamburg University]] in Germany gave Kaspersky's software first place in a competitive analysis of antivirus software.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot;/&gt; This led to more business for Kaspersky from European and American companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=Russia Beyond The Headlines | date=April 29, 2010 | url=http://rbth.com/articles/2010/04/29/the_virus_warrior_a_start_up_tale.html |title=The virus warrior: a start-up tale| accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaspersky Lab was founded three years later by Kaspersky, his wife and Kaspersky's friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;twentyone&quot;/&gt;{{efn|Sources conflict and/or are ambiguous as to the exact number of engineers besides Kaspersky and his wife cofounded the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCL. 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Sambandaraksa|first=Don | publisher=Post Publishing | title=Kaspersky wants digital passports | website=Bangkok Post | date=3 September 2015 | url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/world-updates/198706/kaspersky-wants-digital-passports | accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swartz 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Swartz | first=Jon | title=Russian Kaspersky Lab offers antivirus protection in U.S. | website=ABC News | date=25 November 2008 | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=6329227&amp;page=1 | accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} Natalya, who pushed Eugene to start the company, was the CEO, while Eugene was the head of research.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt; The following year, the [[CIH virus]] (AKA the Chernobyl virus) created a boon for Kaspersky's anti-virus products, which Kaspersky said was the only software at-the-time that could cleanse the virus.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt; According to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', &quot;their software was advanced for the time.&quot; For example, it was the first software to monitor viruses in an isolated quarantine.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt;

Kaspersky's company grew quickly in the late 1990s. From 1998 to 2000, its annual revenue grew 280 percent and by 2000 almost sixty percent of revenues were international.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weissman 2015&quot;/&gt; By 2000, it had a staff of 65 people, up from 13 shortly after its foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt; The antivirus product was renamed to Kaspersky Antivirus in 2000, after an American company started using the product's original name, which wasn't trademarked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schofield 2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weissman 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Weissman | first=Cale Guthrie | title=A look inside the insanely successful life of Russian mathematician and shrewd businessman Eugene Kaspersky | website=Business Insider | date=16 July 2015 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/eugene-kaspersky-profile-2015-7 | accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threat discoveries===
As the head of research,&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;/&gt; Kaspersky authored papers on viruses and went to conferences to promote the software.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;/&gt; He was often quoted in the technology press as an antivirus expert.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt; He helped establish the company's Global Research and Expert Analysis Team (GReAT), which helps corporations and governments investigate IT security threats.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt; Initially he told his team not to discuss cyber-terrorism publicly, to avoid giving governments ideas on how to sabotage their political opponents. After [[Die Hard 4]] was released, he said the idea was now public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbs 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Gibbs | first=Samuel | title=Eugene Kaspersky: major cyberterrorist attack is only matter of time | website=the Guardian | date=1 May 2014 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/01/eugene-kaspersky-major-cyberterrorist-attack-uk | accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hired the researcher that identified the Stuxnet worm, which is believed to be the first instance of state-sponsored cyberweapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://foreignpolicy.com/2012/11/26/the-fp-top-100-global-thinkers-2/|first=Eugene|last=Kaspersky|journal=Foreign Policy|date=December 2012|issue=197|title=100 Top Global Thinkers of 2012: For decoding the secrets of cyberwar; Computer security expert, Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the company exposed the [[Flame virus]] at the request of the [[International Telecommunication Union]]. The virus was believed to have been used for cyber-espionage in Middle-Eastern countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/04/technology/cyberweapon-warning-from-kaspersky-a-computer-security-expert.html?pagewanted=all|title=Expert Issues a Cyberwar Warning|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 June 2012|first1=Andrew E.|last1=Kramer|first2=Nicole|last2=Perlroth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;/&gt;

Kaspersky Lab developed a reputation for discovering cybersecurity threats.&lt;ref name=&quot;France 24 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Europe - Would you trust Eugene Kaspersky, Russia’s ‘Cyber Security King’? | website=France 24 | date=6 October 2015 | url=http://www.france24.com/en/20151006-eugene-kaspersky-trust-russia-cyber-security-king-spy-espionage-kgb-allegations-banya-monac | accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;economist&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Button | first=Clicking This | title=The Kaspersky equation | website=The Economist | date=21 February 2015 | url=http://www.economist.com/news/business/21644154-russian-antivirus-firm-impresses-sceptics-again-kaspersky-equation | accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Kaspersky and Kaspersky Lab discovered a group of hackers known as Carbanak that were stealing money from banks. They also exposed [[Equation Group]], which developed advanced spyware for monitoring desktop activity and was believed to be affiliated with [[National Security Agency]] in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist&quot;/&gt; According to ''The Economist'', it was these discoveries, Kaspersky's &quot;relentless salesmanship&quot; and the company's anti-virus product that made Kaspersky Lab uncommon as an internationally recognized Russian company.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;economist&quot;/&gt;

===CEO===
Kaspersky became CEO of Kaspersky Lab in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;/&gt; According to a 2008 article in ''USA Today'', he traveled to 20 to 30 countries per year promoting Kaspersky Lab products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian cybercrime fighter sells security|first=Jon|last=Swartz|newspaper=USA Today|date=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, ''CRN'' said his personality contributed to the company's growth from &quot;relative obscurity to now nipping at the heels of its larger, better-known rivals.&quot; At the time, Kaspersky Lab was the fourth largest endpoint security company. It introduced new products for the enterprise market and expanded its channel programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman 2009&quot;/&gt;

In 2011, Kaspersky made a decision against taking the company public, saying it would make decision-making slow and prevent long-term R&amp;D investments. This led to a series of high-level departures from the company, including his ex-wife and co-founder.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;economist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkle 2014&quot;/&gt; Another series of departures occurred in 2014 due to disagreements over how to run the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkle 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Finkle | first=Jim | title=Kaspersky Lab executives depart amid business strategy dispute | website=Reuters | date=2 May 2014 | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/02/us-kaspersky-management-idUSBREA410RS20140502 | accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaspersky Lab has defended itself against allegedly frivolous patent claims more aggressively than most IT companies. In 2012, it was the only one of 35 firms named in a suit by patent troll Information Protection and Authentication (IPAC) to take the case to court, rather than pay a fee. The case was ruled in Kaspersky's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kaspersky Lab the only one of 35 companies to defeat IPAT patent troll | website=ipfrontline.com | date=7 August 2012 |url=http://ipfrontline.com/2012/08/kaspersky-lab-the-only-one-of-35-companies-to-defeat-ipat-patent-troll/ | accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012, another company, [[Lodsys]], sued Kaspersky and 54 other companies for patent infringement, and that case also resulted in the claimant dropping the case against Kaspersky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Ribeiro | first=John | title=Patent troll Lodsys backs down from Kaspersky dispute | website=PCWorld.com | date=12 October 2013 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2051940/patent-firm-lodsys-backs-out-of-dispute-with-kaspersky-lab.html | accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in TechWorld, the company's aversion to settling these claims is most likely because Eugene &quot;just hates&quot; patent trolls. In his blog he called them &quot;parasites&quot; and &quot;IT racketeers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunn 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Dunn | first=John E | title=Eugene Kaspersky, patent troll killer | website=Techworld | date=8 October 2013 | url=http://www.techworld.com/blog/war-on-error/eugene-kaspersky-patent-troll-killer-3537966/ | accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kaspersky himself is the co-author of several [[patent]]s, including one for a constraint-and-attribute-based security system for controlling software component interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/eugene-v-kaspersky |title=Patents by Inventor Eugene V. Kaspersky|publisher=justia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, Kaspersky Lab now employs more than 2,800 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;one&quot;/&gt; As of 2012, Kaspersky has been working on developing software to protect critical infrastructure, like power plants, from cyberwarfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;/&gt; He throws a New Years party each year with about 1,500 guests and hosts Kaspersky conferences in exotic locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt;

==Controversies==

===Alleged affiliations with Russia===
Eugene Kaspersky's prior work for the Russian military and his education at a KGB-sponsored technical college has led to controversy about whether he uses his position to advance Russian government interests and intelligence efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zetter 2014 p. 293&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Zetter | first=K. | title=Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon | publisher=Crown/Archetype | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-7704-3618-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1l2YAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT293 | accessdate=11 November 2015 | page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kaspersky, allegations of dubious connections with Russian agencies began after he got his first clients in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;/&gt; He spends much of his working life trying to get governments and organizations to trust him and his software in spite of the allegations.&lt;ref name=&quot;France 24 2015&quot;/&gt;

''Wired'' said Kaspersky's critics accuse him of using the company to spy on users for Russian intelligence. Russian telecommunications companies for example are required by federal law in Russia to cooperate with the government's military and spy operations if asked.

===Alleged anti-virus spoofing===

In August 2015, two former Kaspersky employees alleged that the company introduced modified files into the [[VirusTotal]] community anti-virus database to trick its rivals' programs into triggering false positives.  The result of the false positives was that important uninfected files would be disabled or deleted.  The allegations also claimed that Kaspersky himself had ordered some of the actions, specifically targeting competitors, including Chinese companies he felt were copying his software.  Emails dated 2009, two years after Kaspersky became CEO, were allegedly leaked to [[Reuters]], one of which allegedly had Kaspersky threatening to go after competitors by &quot;rubbing them out in the outhouse,&quot; using a phrase popularized by [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name = reuters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kaspersky-rivals-idUSKCN0QJ1CR20150814 |title=Exclusive: Russian antivirus firm faked malware to harm rivals - Ex-employees |publisher=reuters.com |date=2015-08-14 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Menn 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Menn | first=Joseph | title=Exclusive: Russia's Kaspersky threatened to 'rub out' rival, email shows | website=Reuters | date=28 August 2015 | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/28/us-kaspersky-rivals-idUSKCN0QX2GO20150828 | accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company denied the allegations.&lt;ref name = &quot;reuters&quot;/&gt;

==Views==
Eugene Kaspersky is influential among politicians and security experts.&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=A tech tycoon who values privacy: Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3db0fb72-06f0-11e2-92b5-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3t6mslhSv|last=Palmer|first=Maija|newspaper=Financial Times |date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been active in promoting warnings about the possibility of cyberwarfare that targets critical infrastructure. He regularly speaks at conferences advocating for an international cyberwarfare treaty,&lt;ref name=&quot;six&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nine&quot;/&gt; that would ban government-sponsored cyberattacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;two&quot;/&gt;

After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky proposed that the internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have some parts of the internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCL. 2015&quot;/&gt; For example, accessing a network operated by a nuclear power plant could require a verified identity through a digital passport.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;/&gt;

Kaspersky said anonymity on the internet could be protected by using a proxy, whereby a responsible international body maintains a record of which online identities correspond to which real-world ones. For example, a browser's identity would be revealed in cases of malicious activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;twentyone&quot;/&gt; Some security experts believe that a centralized database of the real-world identities of internet users would be &quot;a privacy disaster and a highly attractive target for thieves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;twentyone&quot;/&gt; ''The Age'' said it &quot;sounds a little too close for comfort to a Big Brother scenario&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;twentyone&quot;/&gt; and ''Wired'' said Kaspersky's views were highly aligned with the Russian government's agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarquhar 2016&quot;/&gt;

Many organizations have been considering reducing privacy to improve security as a result of Kaspersky's arguments.&lt;ref name=&quot;eleven&quot;/&gt; In a more recent Slashdot interview Kaspersky said the internet should be divided into three zones: a red zone for voting, online banking, and other &quot;critical transactions&quot; that would require an internet ID; a grey zone that may only require verification of age to access the site, but not identity; and a green zone for blogs, news, and &quot;everything related to your freedom of speech.&quot; He proposes &quot;special proxies&quot; for red zone websites that allow disclosure of the user's identity only in the case of suspected malfeasance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maverick 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Maverick | first=Magic | title=Interviews: Eugene Kaspersky Answers Your Questions | website=Slashdot | date=13 December 2012 | url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/12/12/13/182206/interviews-eugene-kaspersky-answers-your-questions | accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
