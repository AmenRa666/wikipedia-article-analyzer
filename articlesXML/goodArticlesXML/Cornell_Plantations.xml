The '''Cornell Plantations''' is a [[botanical garden]] located adjacent to the [[Cornell University]] campus in [[Ithaca, New York]].  The Plantations proper consist of {{convert|25|acre|ha}} of botanical gardens and {{convert|150|acre|ha}} of the '''F.R. Newman Arboretum'''. The greater Plantations includes 40 different nature areas around Cornell and Ithaca, covering {{convert|4300|acre|ha}}.

The origin of the Plantations dates back to Cornell's beginning in the mid-19th century and are part of the university's longtime interest in agriculture, forestry, and the natural sciences.  The Plantations saw a major planting effort during the 1930s and assumed their present name in 1944.  Gardens and facilities have continually expanded, including a construction program at the start of the 21st century.  The Plantations also maintains four gardens on Cornell's central campus.  The Plantations offers three courses for academic credit, are used as a resource by other classes, host a number of informal lectures and tours, and have played a part in many scholarly papers. {{As of|2009}}, the Plantations had a $2.9 million annual operating budget.

The botanical gardens at the Plantations specialize in trees and shrubs native to New York State.  The themed herb garden is especially noted.  The Plantations have been the subject of several books and films over the years, are open daily without charge, and have been recommended as a visitation site by a number of travel books and newspaper travel sections.

==History==
[[File:Cornell Plantations lake.jpg|thumb|right|One of the ponds at Cornell Plantations]]
Prior to the founding of Cornell University, [[Ezra Cornell]] had a large farm on the East Hill above Ithaca, New York.  As part of locating New York State's [[land-grant university|land-grant college]] in Ithaca, Cornell offered to donate the farm for use as a campus.  In 1862, Cornell's first president, [[Andrew Dickson White]], wrote a colleague that a great university should include a botanical garden: “It must have the best of Libraries – collections in different departments – Laboratory – Observatory – Botanical Garden perhaps…”&lt;ref name=p&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/about/name|title=What is in a name?|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At the university's opening ceremony in 1868, [[Louis Agassiz]], an internationally-known naturalist, remarked that no other area could compete with Cornell's surroundings in the opportunities offered for the study of natural history. From its inception, Cornell formed a reputation for creative means of research into the natural sciences, including the establishment of the pioneering [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ngg&quot;/&gt;

When the university built its first women's dormitory in 1875, it included a conservatory for growing plants and a specimen tree collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/about/history|title=Planations History|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, the [[Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine|College of Veterinary Medicine]] started a specialized garden of plants that are poisonous to livestock. Cornell's farm included two deep gorges which flanked both sides of the early campus, and as the campus developed the gorges remained undeveloped and filled with native plants and wildlife.  These became the start of the on-campus gardens and arboretum.  A goal of creating an explicit arboretum was proposed in various university reports to trustees and other publications in 1877, 1883, 1908, and 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;bishop&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of Cornell | first=Morris | last=Bishop | authorlink=Morris Bishop | publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] | location=Ithaca, New York | year=1962 | isbn=0-8014-0036-8 | pages=453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell's acquisition of off-campus forest land dates to 1898 and the founding of the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell|New York State College of Forestry]], which was the first forestry college in North America.&lt;ref name=dnr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/|accessdate=2009-09-05|title=Department History  by R.T.

The harvesting of trees from that forest drew heated opposition from neighboring land owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0L8LAAAAYAAJ|title=A History of the Adirondacks, Volume II|first=Alfred Lee|last=Donaldson|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0L8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203 202–207]|publisher=[[The Century Company]]|location=New York|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although political opposition caused Cornell to transfer the forest lands under the &quot;forever wild&quot; protection of the Adirondack Forest Preserve and to transfer Cornell's forestry education programs to its College of Agriculture, Cornell continued to acquire forest land remote from its main campus.  In 1935, the decision to create an arboretum was finally made&lt;ref name=&quot;bishop&quot;/&gt; and the university established the Arboretum as a separate department. From 1935 to 1940, the federal government's [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] Camp  SP 48 devoted 170 to 200 workers to planting trees, constructing dikes, and building trails in order to develop the Arboretum.&lt;ref name=&quot;bishop&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;d=CDS19401107.1.5&amp;e=--------20--1----Arboretum-all|title=CCC Camp SP 48 Carries on Work for Arboretum|newspaper=The Cornell Daily Sun|volume=61|number=40|date=November 7, 1940|page=5|accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;srpos=17&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CDS19400306.2.3.3&amp;e=--------20--1----Arboretum-all|title=Mayor Campbell Protests Against Abandoning CCC|newspaper=The Cornell Daily Sun|volume=60|number=115|date=March 6, 1940|page=3|accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], the Dean emeritus of the College of Agriculture and a horticulturalist highly regarded around the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;ngg&quot;/&gt; proposed the present name &quot;Cornell Plantations&quot; for an expanded department in a report that reflected the work of a number of  botany and horticulture professors.&lt;ref name=p/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wgy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=William|title=Liberty's Plantations|url=http://cornellsun.com/2016/09/08/letter-to-the-editor-libertys-plantations/|accessdate=October 24, 2016|agency=The Cornell Daily Sun (September 8, 2016)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1948, the Plantations numbered {{convert|1000|acre|ha}} and the first Director was named, John F. Cornman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50A14F73954177A93C5A81782D85F4C8485F9 | title=Heads Cornell Plantations | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 17, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During a 1949 broadcast on widely heard radio station [[WGY (AM)|WGY]], Cornell emeritus professor [[Bristow Adams]] reflected upon the now five-year-old Plantations, and stated that the relationship between humans and things that grow were of utmost importance and that gardens, forests, and parks were everlasting collections that &quot;have the care and trusteeships of generation after generation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wgy&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FxkqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=koUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=733,4271014&amp;dq=cornell-plantations&amp;hl=en | title=Forum Hears of Vital Role of Floral Parks | newspaper=[[Schenectady Gazette]] | date=October 29, 1949 | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1960s, the sculpture garden was constructed in the middle of the Arboretum as a project of the College of Architecture Art and Planning.  By 1965, the Plantations consisted of {{convert|1500|acre|ha}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-1965&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0F10FE3C5A157A93C7AB178CD85F418685F9 | title=Tourist Time High Above Cayuga's Waters | author=O'Connor, Lois | newspaper=The New York Times | date=July 25, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1970, the university was issuing a publication called ''The Cornell Plantations'', which contained general articles on nature and environmental topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1796147032.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI | title=Recycling | newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] | date=August 28, 1970 | page=A14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HDwgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I2YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3104,1359545&amp;dq=cornell-plantations&amp;hl=en | title=Close Look At A Forest Floor | author=Fritts, Bill | newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] | date=September 6, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in the early 1970s, the Arboretum was upgraded with new roads and plantings funded by major gifts from oil industry figure Floyd R. Newman, and in 1982 the Arboretum was formally named in his honor&lt;ref name=&quot;cp-frna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/our-gardens/arboretum|title=F.R. Newman Arboretum|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as were several other buildings and facilities at Cornell over the years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/18/obituaries/floyd-newman-99-oil-chief-who-gave-millions-to-cornell.html | title=Floyd Newman, 99, Oil Chief Who Gave Millions to Cornell | author=Narvaez, Alfonso A. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 18, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the Plantations experienced people stealing pines and firs for [[Christmas tree]]s, with in some cases trees being taken that were worth several thousand dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;schgaz-thefts&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rRUhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bHIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2645,2376121&amp;dq=cornell+plantations&amp;hl=en | title= Home, Garden Guide and Your Environment | author=Rood, Bill | newspaper=[[Schenectady Gazette]] | date=December 6, 1986 | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A successful countermeasure created by Gerardo Sciarra at the Plantations was covering the trees with a harmless yet visually unpleasant &quot;Ugly Mix&quot; spray that included hydrated limestone, an anti-desiccant, and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;schgaz-thefts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-thefts&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2061FF9385C0C768DDDAB0994D9494D81 | title=Ingenuity Protects Trees From Thieves | author=Faust, Joan Lee | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 15, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique was subsequently recommended to others worried about tree theft.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-thefts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/1985-11-01/Seasons-of-the-Garden.aspx?page=2 | title=The Seasons of the Garden | author=Greg Williams | author2=Pat Williams | magazine=[[Mother Earth News]] | date=November–December 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the Plantations suffered from a series of thefts of new or rare plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;weny-thefts&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.weny.com/News-Local.asp?ARTICLE3864=9145501 | title=Plant Thefts Perplex Cornell Plantations | author=Wright, Emma | publisher=[[WENY-TV]] | date=June 12, 2009 | accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A director at the Plantations, which had no security in place, said that the thieves must have been experienced horticulturalists and that the loss of research and species had been a demoralizing experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;weny-thefts&quot;/&gt;

At the start of the 21st century, the Plantations embarked on a construction program which included: Arboretum Center (2000), Horticultural Center (2001), Mullestein Winter Garden (2002), Ramin Administration Building (2003), Rowley Carpenter Shop (2004), Plant Production Facility (2007), and Lewis Education Center (2008).&lt;ref name=nevin&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct10/PlantationsCtrDedication.html|title=Plantations dedicates new ultra-green welcome center|newspaper=[[Cornell Chronicle]]|date=October 29, 2010|first=Krishna |last=Ramanujan|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new $7.5 million Brian C.

==Academic role==
The Plantations' Director is funded as a professor of Horticulture in the [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]], although 85 percent of the Plantations' budget comes from gifts. The Plantations continue to grow as it receives donations of environmentally-sensitive land throughout New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/our-gardens/natural-areas/McDaniel.meadow|title=McDaniel Meadow, Woods and Swap|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2009}}, the Plantations had a $2.9 million annual operating budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/sites/default/files/CP_%2709Ann.Report.pdf|title=2009 Annual Report|page=4|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the Department of Horticulture in the College of Agriculture, the Plantations sponsors a Graduate Fellowship in Public Garden Leadership, where students earn a [[Master of Professional Studies]] degree after a four-semester program.&lt;ref name=&quot;rakow-lee&quot;/&gt;    The program of study requires an internship, selection of a particular topic of interest, and completion of an action project.&lt;ref name=&quot;rakow-lee&quot;/&gt;  Numerous scientific papers have been published that relate to work done at the Plantations or written by academics affiliated with the Plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22cornell+plantations%22&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=1%2C31 | title='cornell plantations' – Google Scholar | publisher=[[Google Scholar]] | accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Plantations offers three courses for academic credit and a number of informal lectures and tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/learning/courses|title=University Courses|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lab work is done at the Plantations by students taking other courses in various subjects, including geology courses in the interdisciplinary Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=EAS 220 Lab Book: EAS 220 Introduction to the Earth System | publisher=Cornell University | year=2007 | pages=240–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the greater Plantations has a connection of some kind to over a hundred courses at Cornell.&lt;ref name=&quot;rakow-lee&quot;/&gt;  The Plantations' Director has also been responsible for summer session courses at the Plantations aimed towards alumni and horticultural enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Cornell University Announcements | title=Summer Session 1973 | volume=65 | issue=3 | date=March 1973 | publisher=Cornell University | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plantations operate side-by-side with Cornell's other programs.  Cornell's academic buildings, which are owned by either the university or New York State (for [[statutory college]] buildings), are on a landscaped campus with Plantations' gardens interspersed among them; the Plantations  maintains four such gardens on Cornell's central campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/about|title=About Cornell Plantations|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the College of Agriculture operates the Arnot Woods as a teaching forest, about {{convert|15|mi}} southwest of Ithaca;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dnr.cornell.edu/arnot/about/maps.htm|title=Location and maps|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was given to the university in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;bishop&quot;/&gt; Near the Plantations, the College operates the Dilmun Hill Student Farm, which practices sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuaes.cornell.edu/cals/cuaes/ag-operations/dilmun-hill/index.cfm|title=Dilmun Hill Student Farm|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College  operates Campus Area Farms that comprise 11 different farms and {{convert|325|acre|ha}} on campus and nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuaes.cornell.edu/cals/cuaes/ag-operations/index.cfm|title=Agricultural operations, policies, farms|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the Plantations and these other adjacent properties is that the Plantations are open to the public and are designed for both instruction as well as leisure, while the other properties are closed to the general public and focused upon teaching and research.  Aside from physical proximity, the Plantations has affiliations with a number of Cornell academic departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/about/affiliations|title=Affiliations|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In fact, during the latter part of the 20th century, public gardens attached to colleges and universities such as the Plantations became a popular trend, due to the beneficial effects they had on campus unity and recruitment of students, creating bonds with and outreach to the local community,  and providing a basis for ongoing research as well as establishing a living museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;rakow-lee&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Public Garden Management: A Complete Guide to the Planning and Administration  of  Botanical Gardens and Arboreta | first=Donald A. | last=Rakow | first2=Sharon A. | last2=Lee | publisher	=[[John Wiley and Sons]] | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | year= 2011 | isbn=0-470-53213-0 | pages=13, 213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plantations earned a relatively brief mention as a campus diversion in the 112-page ''Cornell Desk Book'' publication of 1972 aimed at incoming students.&lt;ref name=&quot;deskbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cornell Desk Book | editor-first=S. Kent | editor-last=Callahan | publisher=Cornell University New Student Orientation Committee | location=Ithaca, New York | year=1972 | page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'' listed it in 2010 as one of the natural wonders of the Cornell and Ithaca areas that students frequently went past, or lived near to, without noticing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cornellsun.com/node/42368 | title=7 Wonders of Ithaca  | author=Shepard, Laura | newspaper=The Cornell Daily Sun | date=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1973 ''[[New York Times]]'' survey of public arboreta listed the Plantations as one of the 17&amp;nbsp;best in the Eastern U.S. for educational value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30613F93C5C147A93C7AB1789D85F478785F9 | title=Arboretums Are for Seeing and Learning | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 25, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same paper characterized the Robison Herb Garden as &quot;a student's living reference library&quot; when it opened in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-1974&quot;/&gt;

The 200-page volume ''The Cornell Plantations'', written by Ralph S. Hosmer, was published by the university in 1947, shortly after the gardens were so named.&lt;ref name=&quot;bishop&quot;/&gt;  A film ''Cornell Plantations'' was made during 1974–1975 and shown on [[PBS]] in Connecticut and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/12/obituaries/norma-k-regan-95-teacher-and-sculptor.html | title=Norma K. Regan, 95, Teacher and Sculptor | newspaper=The New York Times | date=November 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1987, the Plantations released a [[VHS]] video entitled ''A Year in the Garden'', which showed seasonal changes in the F. R. Newman Arboretum and along the trails.  ''The New York Times'' called the effort &quot;thin&quot; and best suited for Cornell alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/arts/home-video-high-gloss-jagger-and-a-boris-to-be-cherished-632387.html | title=Home Video | author=Faust, Joan Lee | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 15, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university published the volume ''Cornell Plantations Path Guide: The Gardens, Gorges, Landscapes, and Lore of Cornell'' in 1995, and a 172-page second edition was published with a slightly altered title in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=%22Cornell+Plantations+path+guide%22&amp;x=11&amp;y=14 | title='Cornell University path guide' search | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with the [[Newman's Own Foundation]] and the [[Center for Plant Conservation]], the Plantations are trying to restore the regional population of the American globeflower (''Trollius laxus'').  The Plantations are trying to use predatory beetles (''Laricobius nigrinus'') to control the spread of the hemlock wooly adelgid (HWA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/sites/default/files/CP_%2709Ann.Report.pdf|title=2009 Annual Report|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events and visiting==
The Plantations are open daily without charge from dawn to dusk.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa-ny2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=AAA New York TourBook | publisher=[[American Automobile Association]] | edition=2009 | location=Heathrow, Florida | pages=95,685,692–693}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the campus, one walks out Forest Home Drive past the College of Agriculture quadrangle;&lt;ref name=&quot;deskbook&quot;/&gt; the nearest highway is [[New York State Route 366]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa-ny2009&quot;/&gt;  Walk-up tours are offered twice a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;frommers&quot;/&gt;    Adult volunteers also serve as stewards, tour guides and special event staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellplantations.org/learning/volunteer-program|title=Volunteer Program|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such [[Museum docent|docents]] are challenged by the large variety of plants; one joked in 2010 that, &quot;The ones I don’t know the name of, I call ''Species Nocluesem''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;buffnews&quot;/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' has recommended Cornell Plantations as a place to visit several times, calling it &quot;a satisfying experience&quot; in 1965,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-1965&quot;/&gt; one of the sights of Cornell in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30610F9345C12728DDDA00894D1405B898BF1D3 | title=What's Doing in Ithaca | author=Landau, Susan | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 9, 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a destination along a bicycling tour in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/19/travel/the-finger-lakes-250-miles-by-bike.html | title=The Finger Lakes – 250 Miles By Bike | author=Pasternack, Dorothy | newspaper=The New York Times | date=May 19, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;another free diversion&quot; in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/travel/what-s-doing-in-the-finger-lakes.html | title=What's Doing in the Finger Lakes | author=Lumdsen, Linda | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 20, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;one last outing before leaving [Ithaca]&quot; in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-2000&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/25/travel/journeys-36-hours-ithaca-ny.html | title=36 Hours: Ithaca, N.Y. | author=Barry, Rebecca | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' recommended the Plantations in 2000 as a &quot;free to the public museum of living plants&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/58529076.html?dids=58529076:58529076&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | title=New York's Finger Lakes: A Treat to the Visitor | author=Vida, Vera | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=August 20, 2000 | page=L1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, ''[[The Ithaca Journal]]'' referred to it as &quot;one of the area's gems&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/ithacajournal/access/1733605771.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | title=Ithaca Forward: Activities to do here now that spring has come | newspaper=[[The Ithaca Journal]] | date=March 29, 2007 | page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three years later said it &quot;combines the best of walking with the eye appeal of well tended gardens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/ithacajournal/access/1999170081.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | title=Some places to revel in nature | newspaper=[[The Ithaca Journal]] | date=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' portrayed the Plantations in 2010 as one of the places that made Cornell worth a vacation for non-students.&lt;ref name=&quot;buffnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.buffalonews.com/life/travel/article102017.ece | title=College without the classes | author=Brennan, James | newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]] | date=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Automobile Association]]'s New York [[TourBook]] lists the Plantations as one of five arboreta and sixty gardens in the state; it does not get the &quot;GEM&quot; rating that one of the arboreta and ten of the gardens receive.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa-ny2009&quot;/&gt;  [[Fodor's]] travel book for New York State lists the Plantations as an ordinary entry and says the gardens have &quot;interesting cold-weather colors and textures&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Fodor's New York State | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Fodor's]] | location=New York | year=2009 | isbn=1-4000-0897-2 | editor-first=Debbie | editor-last=Harmsen | page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Moon Handbooks]] volume for the state also lists it as a regular entry, without much commentary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Moon New York State | edition=5th | publisher=[[Avalon Travel Publishing]] | location= | year=2010 | isbn=1-59880-342-5 | page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the Great Destinations series ''The Finger Lakes Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Finger Lakes Book: Great Destinations | first=Katharine Delavan | last=Dyson | publisher=[[Countryman Press]] | edition=Third | location=Woodstock, Vermont | year=2007 | isbn=1-58157-045-7 | page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fun with the Family ''Upstate New York'' volume groups it with several other sights as &quot;a real bargain&quot; to explore for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Fun with the Family: Upstate New York | first=Mary Lynn | last=Blanks | publisher=GPP Travel | location=Guilford, Connecticut | year=2010 | isbn=0-7627-5408-7 | page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most enthusiastic is the [[Frommer's]] travel guide for New York State, which rates the Plantations as a one-star (&quot;highly recommended&quot;) sight, saying the Plantations is &quot;a real find and well worth a visit for garden lovers or anyone seeking a bit of solace.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;frommers&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Frommer's New York State | edition=4th | publisher=[[Wiley Publishing]] | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | year=2010 | isbn=0-470-53765-5 | first=Brian | last= Silverman | first2= Neil Edward | last2=Schlecht | first3= Kerry | last3=Acker | first4= Tom | last4=Gavin | page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The herb garden and knoll of rhododendrons come in for particular praise.&lt;ref name=&quot;frommers&quot;/&gt;
