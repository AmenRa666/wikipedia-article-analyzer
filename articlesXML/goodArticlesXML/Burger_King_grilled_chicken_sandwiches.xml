International fast-food restaurant chain [[Burger King]] and its Australian franchise [[Hungry Jack's]] have had a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1990. The '''BK Broiler''' was the first iteration, and was one of the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the '''Chicken Whopper''' to align the product with the company's [[Whopper]] Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the '''BK Baguette''' product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the '''TenderGrill''' chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals [[Wendy's]] by six months and [[McDonald's]] by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.

The company sells slightly different versions of the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.

==History==

=== BK Broiler ===
Burger King's first broiled chicken sandwich was introduced in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrn-kids club&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.highbeam.com/409700/article-1G1-8829375/franchisees-bk-kid-club-took-so-long |title=Franchisees on BK Kid's Club: what took so long? |last=Carlino |first=Bill |date=30 March 1990 |work=Nation's Restaurant News |accessdate=6 June 2009 |type=subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzjohn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Fitzjohn Navigates Careful BK International Growth |last=Bernstein |first=Charles |date=15 May 1995 |work=Restaurants &amp; Institutions Magazine |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an [[oat]] dusted roll.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Broiler Build&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Burros |first=Marian |title=Fast Food Chains Try to Slim Down |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/11/garden/eating-well-fast-food-chains-try-to-slim-down.html?scp=10&amp;sq=BK+Broiler&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |date=11 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product came at a time of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-BK Broiler&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramirez |first=Anthony |title=Getting Burned By the Frying Pan |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/business/getting-burned-by-the-frying-pan.html?scp=7&amp;sq=BK+Broiler&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |date=20 March 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Health trends&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Burros |first=Marian |title=The Slimming Of Fat Fast Food |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/25/garden/eating-well-the-slimming-of-fat-fast-food.html?scp=1&amp;sq=BK+Broiler&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |date=25 July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18&amp;nbsp;grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.&lt;ref name=NYT-Nutrition&gt;{{cite news |last=Burros |first=Marian |title=Weighing In on the Nutrition Scale |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/13/business/weighing-in-on-the-nutrition-scale.html?scp=5&amp;sq=BK%20Broiler&amp;st=cse |accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |date=13 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the BK Broiler was one of the most successful product launches in the restaurant industry at the time, encouraging the company look into introducing additional products that would match the success of the Broiler.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-BK Broiler 2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramirez |first=Anthony |title=Fast Food Lightens Up But Sales Are Often Thin |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/19/business/fast-food-lightens-up-but-sales-are-often-thin.html?scp=8&amp;sq=BK+Broiler&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |date=19 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the success of the product was credited by analysts from Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities as one of the main factors helping Burger King realize a 47% increase in profit margin over the same period in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;IHT-BK profits&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Grand Met's Net Up 36% |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/17/business/grand-met-s-net-up-36.html |accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |publisher=New York Times |date=17 May 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992, sales of the BK Broiler had slowed to half of what they were at the height of it introduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Sales decline&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Burros |first=Marian |title=Eating Well |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/06/garden/eating-well.html?scp=7&amp;sq=Chicken+Whopper&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |date=14 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company reformulated the BK Broiler in 1998 into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich served on a [[Whopper]] bun, increasing its patty size while changing the ingredients to mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato. The idea behind the up-sizing of the product was to give the customer a sense of value, with a company spokesman stating &quot;When they [the customer] see a lot, it seems like they're getting a lot for their money, and even if they don't eat it all, they think they're being treated fairly.&quot; The move was part of the company's &quot;back to basics&quot; movement in which it reorganized its menu, focusing on its core products and simplifying its product base.&lt;ref name=NYT-Lubow&gt;{{cite news |last=Lubow |first=Arthur |title=Steal this burger |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/19/magazine/steal-this-burger.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=23 September 2011|newspaper=New York Times |date=14 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chicken Whopper ===
[[File:Chicken Whoppers.JPG|thumb|right|An example of the Chicken Whopper Jr. (left) and the Chicken Whopper.]]
As part of the forty-fifth anniversary of its [[Whopper|Whopper sandwich]] in 2002, BK introduced an updated version of the sandwich called the Chicken Whopper and added a smaller version called the Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich along with a new Caesar salad sandwich topped with a Chicken Whopper filet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Allen, Robin Lee |url=http://business.highbeam.com/409700/article-1G1-84019673/crown-jewels-new-marketing-product-rollouts-energize |title=Crown jewels: New marketing, product rollouts energize BK journey back to fast-food royalty |work=Nation's Restaurant News |date=18 March 2002 |type=subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Burger King Corporation |url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-23-2002/0001734302&amp;EDATE= |title=Burger King Sells 40 Millionth Chicken Whopper |date=23 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CT-Chicken&gt;{{cite news |last=Rector |first=Sylvia |title=Chicken rules fast-food roost |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-11-06/entertainment/0211060202_1_menu-board-national-chicken-council-panera-bread |accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=6 November 2002|agency=Knight Ridder/Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the Chicken Whopper represented the company's first move to extend the Whopper brand name beyond beef-based sandwiches since the original Whopper's introduction in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB-Carrols&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Carrols: Chicken Whopper Is A Bust|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/eating-drinking-places/4274163-1.html |work=All Business |publisher=[[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]] |accessdate=23 September 2011 |date=March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sandwiches featured a whole chicken breast filet, weighing either {{convert|4.7|oz|g|abbr=on}} for the larger sandwich and a {{convert|3.1|oz|g|abbr=on}} for the Jr., mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato on a sesame seed roll.&lt;ref name=&quot;HC-Chick Whopper&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Ken |title=Chicken sandwich grows up to be a Whopper |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/2002_3535763/chicken-sandwich-grows-up-to-be-a-whopper.html |accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=Huston Chronicle |date=12 April 2002 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newly reformulated low fat mayonnaise was introduced in conjunction with the new sandwiches.&lt;ref name=&quot;BW-Sales&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Wahlgren |first=Eric |title=Burger Makers' Not-So-Meaty Prospects |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/apr2002/nf2002049_3504.htm |accessdate=24 September 2011 |work=Business Week |date=9 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the company's new [[BK Veggie]] sandwich, The Chicken Whopper Jr. version of the sandwich was lauded by the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] as being one of the best nutritionally sound products sold by a fast food chain. Conversely, the CSPI decried the rest of the Burger King menu as being vastly unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=CSPI Picks the Best and Worst Fast Foods |url=http://www.cspinet.org/new/200208211_print.html |publisher=Center for Science in the Public Interest |accessdate=24 September 2011 |date=21 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the sandwich began in 2001 in response to several major factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;CT-Chicken&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT-Chick Whopper&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Horovitz |first=Bruce |title=Fast-food giants always trying new tastes |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/general/2002/07/03/fast-food.htm |accessdate=24 September 2011 |newspaper=USA Today |date=3 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King held a series of consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases.&lt;ref name=CT-Chicken/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BW-Sales&quot;/&gt; Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT-Chick Whopper&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer [[fast casual restaurant]]s that had begun to bite into sales.&lt;ref name=CT-Chicken/&gt; By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of the sandwiches, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT-Chick Whopper&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QSR-Chick Whopper&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=50 Millionth Chicken Whopper Sandwich Will Be Sold Today |url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/07-01-2002/0001756551&amp;EDATE= |publisher=Burger King Corporation |accessdate=23 September 2011 |date=1 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper was one of the few noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner [[Diageo]] to a group of investors led by the [[TPG Capital]]; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's too early to tell whether the changes have been successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFC-BK sale&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Colliver |first=Victoria |title=Whopper of a Deal |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-07-26/business/17552677_1_goldman-sachs-capital-partners-diageo-plc-burger-king-s-north-american/2|accessdate=24 September 2011 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=26 July 2002 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the Chicken Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, [[Carrols Corporation]], was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB-Carrols&quot;/&gt; As of November 2013, the Chicken Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BK-ME menu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Burger King menu - Middle East|url=http://www.burgerkingme.com/menu/localmenu.php |publisher=Burger King |accessdate=1 December 2013 |date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its 2014 expansion in to [[India]], Burger King introduced the Chicken Whopper as one of three versions of the Whopper. The other two variants are the [[Mutton]] Whopper and the Veggie Whopper.

=== BK Baguette ===
[[File:BK TenderGrill (new).jpg|thumb |left |2nd US version of the TenderGrill chicken sandwich.]]
In 2004, BK introduced its BK Baguette line of sandwiches designed to replace the Chicken Whopper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox-Blum&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,97477,00.html |title=New Burger King Menu Targets Healthy Eaters |agency=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=16 September 2003 |accessdate=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BKC-Baguette 1&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Burger King Corporation |url=http://www.junkfoodnews.net/burgerking-chickenbaguette.htm |title=Burger King's New Low-Fat Fire-Grilled Savory Mustard Chicken Baguette |date=June 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sandwiches were introduced at the insistence of the new [[CEO]], former [[Darden Restaurants]] executive [[Brad Blum|Bradley (Brad) Blum]], shortly after the company was acquired by [[TPG Capital]] in 2002. The sandwiches were designed to be a lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 or fewer calories.&lt;ref name=NYT-Baguettes&gt;{{cite web |last=Day |first=Sherri |title=Burger King to sell low-fat chicken sandwiches |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/19/business/company-news-burger-king-to-sell-low-fat-chicken-sandwiches.html |work=New York Times |accessdate=17 November 2013 |date=19 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line was a health conscious oriented product that got its taste from ingredients instead of fat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox-Blum&quot;/&gt; They were formally introduced in 2004 as its BK Baguette line of sandwiches, that replacing the Chicken Whopper sandwiches.&lt;ref name=&quot;BKC-Baguette 1&quot;/&gt;

The baguette sandwiches were introduced to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the baguette sandwiches were well received and continue to be sold, several red flags have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the healthiness of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British [[Food Standards Agency]] (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt baguette and chided BK for backing out of an agreement to help make the company's products healthier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://verify.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1817439,00.html |title=Burger King opts out of health food drive |first=Jonathan |last=Leake |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=[[News International]] |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=4 December 2007 |quote=The company has recently suggested its new range of &quot;fresh-baked baguettes&quot; offers a healthier choice. It includes the Monterey Melt which contains 2.3 grams of salt and nearly 600 calories. |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the private public interest group ''Consensus Action on Salt and Health'', abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT Baguette sandwich, when paired with fries and a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7050585.stm |title=Fast food salt levels 'shocking' |author= |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=4 December 2007 |quote=A meal at a fast food restaurant could expose children to &quot;staggeringly&quot; high levels of salt, a survey has suggested.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071020132157/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7050585.stm| archivedate= 20 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TenderGrill ===
[[File:BK TenderGrill.jpg|thumb|right|The original version of the TenderGrill sandwich.]]
The Baguette sandwiches failed to catch on in the American market, and as a result they were discontinued as part of a menu reorganization. In 2005, they were replaced by the TenderGrill sandwich.&lt;ref name=&quot;BK-BBlum&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2004-03-21-burgerking_x.htm |title=Burger King zaps menu, image |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |publisher=USA Today |date=22 March 2004 |accessdate=26 September 2007 |quote=Early on, he pushed a healthier menu that wasn't true to Burger King's core customer.

=== Chicken Burger ===

In December 2015, Burger King introduced the Chicken Burger in the U.S. This sandwich has a patty topped with the standard Whopper toppings of mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup and onion on a toasted brioche bun. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bk.com/menu-item/flame-grilled-chicken-burger |title=Flame Grilled Chicken Burger |accessdate=28 December 2015 |date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.restaurantnews.com/burger-king-restaurants-introduce-flame-grilled-chicken-burger/? |title=Burger King Restaurants Introduce Flame Grilled Chicken Burger |accessdate=28 December 2015 |date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitive products ===

A Burger King spokesman stated that the change was because Burger King &quot;decided that if there's anybody who wants a chicken option, at this point, we wanted to remind them that the Whopper comes in chicken as well as the original beef,&quot; noting their confidence in their beef supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Whopper adverts&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Day |first=Sherrie |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/01/business/a-time-for-finesse-marketing-beef-after-a-mad-cow-discovery.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=A Time for Finesse: Marketing Beef After a Mad Cow Discovery|accessdate=23 September 2011 |newspaper=New York Times |date=1 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising campaign for the TenderGrill sandwich in Spain in 2010 featured a humor-based ad in which men were asked what type of advertisement would get them to buy the sandwich. The responses, which included what men would like to see in the commercials, formed the basis for the ads.&lt;ref name=&quot;AW-TenderGrill spain&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Burger King: An ad for guys|url=http://www.adwomen.org/2010/08/burger-king-an-ad-for-guys/ |work=Ad Women |accessdate=20 November 2013 |date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement, made entirely by women, was filmed in London and featured barbarians, ninjas and unicorns in an advertisement that poked fun at the men's preferences. The making of the commercial was the basis of a mini-documentary from UK firm Feral Films.&lt;ref name=FF-TenderGril&gt;{{cite web |title=Burger King Chicken Tender Grill |url=http://www.feralfilms.co.uk/burger_king_chicken_tender_grill |publisher=Feral Films |accessdate=20 November 2013 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 Singapore campaign, Burger King presented an attack advertisement that was designed to counter the introduction of the Chicken McGrill sandwich from McDonald's. The campaign took McDonald's slogan, ''&quot;Make it better&quot;'' and changed it to ''&quot;Make it even Better&quot;'' and put the sandwich on sale for [[Singapore dollar|SGD]]$1.00 on the same day the McDonald's product was set to debut. Burger King called the McDonald's menu item &quot;fake grilled&quot; as opposed to flame grilled.&lt;ref name=DKSG&gt;{{cite web |last=Kang |first=Darryl |title=The King wants to make it even better |url=http://blog.dk.sg/2011/03/10/the-king-wants-to-make-it-even-better/ |accessdate=20 November 2013 |date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies ===
The 2012 campaign from [[BBDO|Clemenger BBDO]] for the TenderGrill for the Australian Burger King franchise, [[Hungry Jack's]], featured a [[Goth subculture|goth]] girl, complete with facial piercings and tattoos that loses her piercings and tattoos as she eats the sandwich. By the time she has finished her meal, her clothing and style had completely changed&amp;nbsp;– much to her and her friends horror. At the end of the commercial, the announcer states the tag line ''&quot;There is nothing naughty about the new Hungry Jack's TenderGrill&amp;nbsp;... Hungry Jack's makes it better.&quot;'' The [[Advertising Standards Bureau (Australia)|Australian Advertising Standards Bureau]] received several complaints from the public claiming the commercial demeaned alternative lifestyles, was discriminatory and insulting to non-conformists. The Advertising Standards Board determined that the advertisement did not breach any pertinent anti-discrimination codes, and dismissed the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ms.adstandards.com.au/cases/0241-12.pdf Australian Advertising Bureau] case report #0241/12.
