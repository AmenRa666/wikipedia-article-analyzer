'''Architecture in early modern Scotland''' encompasses all building within the borders of the [[kingdom of Scotland]], from the early sixteenth century to the mid-eighteenth century. The time period roughly corresponds to the [[Early modern Europe|early modern era in Europe]], beginning with the [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and ending with the start of the [[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Industrialisation]].

[[Vernacular architecture]] made use of local materials such as stone, turf and, where available, wood. Most of the population was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. The most common form of dwelling throughout Scotland was the [[long house]], shared by humans and animals. About ten per cent of the population lived in the burghs, in a mixture of half-timbered and stone houses.

The impact of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] on Scottish architecture began in the reign of [[James III of Scotland|James III]] in the late fifteenth century with the rebuilding of royal palaces such as [[Linlithgow Palace|Linlithgow]], and reached its peak under [[James V of Scotland|James V]]. The Reformation had a major impact on ecclesiastical architecture from the mid-sixteenth century onward, resulting in simple church buildings, devoid of ornamentation. From the 1560s great private houses were built in a distinctive style that became known as [[Scottish Baronial architecture|Scottish Baronial]]. Such houses combined Renaissance features with those of Scottish castles and tower houses, resulting in larger, more comfortable residences.

After the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]] in 1660, there was a fashion for grand private houses in designs influenced by the [[Palladian]] style and associated with the architects [[Sir William Bruce, 1st Baronet, of Balcaskie|Sir William Bruce]] (1630–1710) and [[James Smith (architect)|James Smith]] (c. 1645–1731). After the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union in 1707]], the threat of [[Jacobite Rebellions]] led to the building of military defences such as [[Fort George, Scotland|Fort George]] near Inverness. Scotland produced some of the most significant architects of the eighteenth century, including [[Colen Campbell]], [[James Gibbs]] and [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]], who all had a major influence on [[Georgian architecture]] across Britain. The influence of Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements, with a pedimented rectangular plan and often with a steeple.

The [[vernacular architecture]] of Scotland, as elsewhere, made use of local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends.&lt;ref name=McKean2010pp55-6/&gt; Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English vernacular architecture, where wood was available, [[cruck]]s (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls.&lt;ref name=Dixon2003pp1870-200&gt;P. Dixon, &quot;[http://www.academia.edu/972677/The_medieval_peasant_building_in_Scotland_the_beginning_and_end_of_crucks, The medieval peasant building in Scotland: the beginning and end of crucks]&quot;, ''Ruralia IV'' (2003), pp. 187–200, available at ''Academia.edu'', retrieved 27 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base.&lt;ref name=Dixon2003pp1870-200/&gt; Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, and had to be rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around [[Dundee]], solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Brunskill, ''Houses and Cottages of Britain'' (New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2nd edn., 2000), ISBN 0-575-07122-2, pp. 235–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.&lt;ref name=McKean2010pp55-6&gt;C. McKean, &quot;Improvement and modernisation in everyday Enlightenment Scotland&quot;, in E. A. Foyster and C. A. Whatley, ed., ''A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1600 to 1800'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), ISBN 0-7486-1965-8, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, ''The Changing Scottish Landscape: 1500–1800'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1991), ISBN 0415029929, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was settled, with ''[[sheilings]]'' (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing), becoming permanent settlements.&lt;ref&gt;I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, ''The Changing Scottish Landscape: 1500–1800'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1991), ISBN 0415029929, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard layout of a house throughout Scotland before agricultural improvement was a [[byre]]-dwelling or [[long house]], with humans and livestock sharing a common roof, often separated by only a partition wall.&lt;ref&gt;I. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, ''The Changing Scottish Landscape: 1500–1800'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1991), ISBN 0-415-02992-9, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries noted that cottages in the [[Highlands and Islands]] tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast, many [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows.&lt;ref name=McKean2010pp55-6/&gt;

Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of many [[burgh]]s that had grown up in the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country.&lt;ref name=Gemmill&amp;Mayhew1995pp8-10&gt;E. Gemmill and N. J. Mayhew, ''Changing Values in Medieval Scotland: a Study of Prices, Money, and Weights and Measures'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), ISBN 0521473853, pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic of Scottish burghs was a long main street of tall buildings, with [[vennel]]s, [[wynd]]s and [[alley]]s leading off it, many of which survive today.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), ISBN 0-7486-0233-X, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; In towns, traditional thatched half-timbered houses were interspersed with the larger stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry.&lt;ref name=McKean2010pp55-6/&gt; Most wooden thatched houses have not survived, but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at [[Lady Stair's House]], [[Acheson House]] and the six-storey [[Gladstone's Land]], an early example of the tendency to build upward in the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided [[tenements]].&lt;ref name=&quot;West1985pp75-6&quot;&gt;T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), ISBN 0-85263-748-9, pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Many burghs acquired [[Tolbooth|tollbooths]] in this period, which acted as town halls, courts and prisons. They often had peels of bells or clock towers and the aspect of a fortress. The [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh]] was rebuilt on the orders of [[Mary Queen of Scots]] from 1561 and housed the [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]] until the end of the 1630s.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Mason, ''Scots and Britons: Scottish Political Thought and the Union of 1603'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), ISBN 0521026202, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples can be seen at [[Tain]], [[Culross]] and [[Stonehaven]], often showing influences from the [[Low Countries]] in their [[crow-stepped gable]]s and steeples.&lt;ref name=&quot;West1985pp73-4&quot;&gt;T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), ISBN 0-85263-748-9, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance==
{{See also|Renaissance in Scotland}}
[[File:Am linlithgow palace north west.jpg|thumb|right|[[Linlithgow Palace]], the first building to bear the title &quot;palace&quot; in Scotland, extensively rebuilt along Renaissance principles from the fifteenth century]]
The extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces probably began under [[James III of Scotland|James III]] (r. 1460–88), accelerated under [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] (r. 1488–1513) and reached its peak under [[James V of Scotland|James V]] (r. 1513–42). The influence of Renaissance architecture is reflected in these buildings. [[Linlithgow Palace|Linlithgow]] was first constructed under [[James I of Scotland|James I]] (r. 1406–27), under the direction of [[Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland|master of work]] John de Waltoun and was referred to as a palace from 1429, apparently the first use of this term in the country.  It was extended under James III and resembled a quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace or ''palatium ad moden castri'' (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery. There is evidence that Italian masons were employed by James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions.&lt;ref name=Glendinningetal1996p9&gt;M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), ISBN 0-7486-0849-4, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1536 James V visited France for his marriage to [[Madeleine of Valois]] and would have come in contact with [[French Renaissance architecture]].  His second marriage to [[Mary of Guise]] two years later may have resulted in longer-term connections and influences.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012p195&gt;A. Thomas, ''The Renaissance'', in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), ISBN 0-19-162433-0, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture from his reign largely disregarded the insular style of England under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and adopted forms that were recognisably European.&lt;ref name=Wormald1991p5&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than slavishly copying continental forms, most Scottish architecture incorporated elements of these styles into traditional local patterns,&lt;ref name=Thomas2012p189&gt;A. Thomas, &quot;The Renaissance&quot;, in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), ISBN 0-19-162433-0, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; adapting them to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and [[harl]]).&lt;ref name=Palliser2000p391-2&gt;D. M. Palliser, ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 600–1540, Volume 1'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0-521-44461-6, pp.&amp;nbsp;391–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The building at Linlithgow was followed by rebuilding at [[Holyrood Palace]], [[Falkland Palace]], [[Stirling Castle]] and [[Edinburgh Castle]],&lt;ref name=Thomas2012p189/&gt; described by Roger Mason as &quot;some of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture in Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mason, &quot;Renaissance and Reformation: the sixteenth century&quot;, in J. Wormald, ed., ''Scotland: A History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), ISBN 0-19-162243-5, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the building programs were planned and financed by [[James Hamilton of Finnart]], [[Steward of the Royal Household]] and [[Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland|Master of Works]] to James V.  He was also responsible for the architectural works at [[Blackness Castle]], [[Rothesay Castle]], the house at [[Crawfordjohn]], the New Inn in the [[St Andrews Cathedral Priory]] and the lodging at [[Balmerino Abbey]] for the ailing Queen Madeleine.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), ISBN 0-7486-1455-9, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Work undertaken for James VI demonstrated continued Renaissance influences; the Chapel Royal at Stirling has a classical entrance built in 1594 and the North Wing of Linlithgow, built in 1618, uses classical pediments. Similar themes can be seen in the private houses of aristocrats, as in [[Mar's Wark]], Stirling (c. 1570) and [[Crichton Castle]], built for the [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]] in 1580s.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp201-2&gt;A. Thomas, &quot;The Renaissance&quot;, in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), ISBN 0-19-162433-0, pp.&amp;nbsp;201–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformation==
{{Main|Church architecture in Scotland}}
{{See also|Scottish Reformation}}
[[File:Burntisland Parish Kirk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burntisland]] Parish Kirk, its original wooden steeple now replaced by one of stone]]
From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church architecture in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship, seeing no need for elaborate buildings divided up for the purpose of ritual. This resulted in the widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration.&lt;ref name=BritScot2&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.architecture.com/HowWeBuiltBritain/HistoricalPeriods/Scottish/KirksThroughoutTheAges/Introduction.aspx |publisher=architecture.com |title=Kirks throughout the ages |author=Royal Institute of British Architects |authorlink=Royal Institute of British Architects |accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New churches were built and existent churches adapted for reformed services, particularly by placing the pulpit centrally in the church, as preaching was at the centre of worship. Many of the earliest buildings were simple gabled rectangles, a style that continued into the seventeenth century, as at [[Dunnottar Castle]] in the 1580s, [[Greenock]] (1591) and [[Durness]] (1619).&lt;ref name=Spicer2000p517&gt;A. Spicer, &quot;Architecture&quot;, in A. Pettegree, ed., ''The Reformation World'' (London: Routledge, 2000), ISBN 0-415-16357-9, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; These churches often have windows on the south wall (and none on the north), which became a characteristic of Reformation kirks. There were continuities with pre-Reformation materials, with some churches using rubble for walls, as at [[Kemback]] in Fife (1582). Others employed dressed stone and a few added wooden steeples, as at [[Burntisland]] (1592).&lt;ref&gt;A. Spicer, ''Calvinist Churches in Early Modern Europe'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2007), ISBN 0-7190-5487-7, pp. 53 and 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The church of [[Greyfriars Kirk|Greyfriars, Edinburgh]], built between 1602 and 1620, used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form, but that at [[Dirleton]] (1612), had a more sophisticated classical style.&lt;ref name=Spicer2000p517/&gt;

A variation of the rectangular church developed in post-Reformation Scotland, and often used when adapting existing churches, was the &quot;T&quot;-shaped plan, which allowed the maximum number of parishioners to be near the pulpit. Examples can be seen at Kemback and [[Prestonpans]] after 1595. This plan continued to be used into the seventeenth century as at [[Weem]] (1600), [[Anstruther Easter]], Fife (1634–44) and [[New Cumnock]] (1657). In the seventeenth century a [[Greek cross]] plan was used for churches such as [[Cawdor]] (1619) and [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire|Fenwick]] (1643). In most of these cases one arm of the cross would have been closed off as a laird's aisle, meaning that they were in effect &quot;T&quot;-plan churches.&lt;ref name=Spicer2000p517/&gt;{{clear}}

==Scots Baronial==
{{Main|Scots Baronial}}
[[File:Claypotts Castle.jpg|thumb|right|The sixteenth-century [[Claypotts Castle]], showing many of the features of the Baronial style]]
The unique style of great private houses in Scotland, later known as Scots Baronial, originated in the 1560s and may have been influenced by the French masons brought to Scotland to work on royal palaces. It kept many of the features of the high walled Medieval castles that had been largely made obsolete by gunpowder weapons and also drew on the [[tower houses]] and [[peel towers]]&lt;ref name=Summerson1993pp502-11&gt;J. Summerson, ''Architecture in Britain, 1530 to 1830'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 9th edn., 1993), ISBN 0-300-05886-1, pp. 502–11.&lt;/ref&gt; that had been built in their hundreds by local lords since the fourteenth century, particularly in the borders. These houses abandoned the defensible curtain walls of castles, being fortified refuges that were designed to outlast a raid, rather than a sustained siege.&lt;ref&gt;S. Toy, ''Castles: Their Construction and History'' (New York: Dover Publications, 1985), ISBN 978-0-486-24898-1, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reid2006p33&gt;S. Reid, ''Castles and Tower Houses of the Scottish Clans, 1450–1650'' (Botley: Osprey, 2006), ISBN 978-1-84176-962-2, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually of three stories, typically crowned with a [[parapet]], projecting on [[corbels]], continuing into circular [[bartizan]]s at each corner.&lt;ref&gt;J. Summerson, ''Architecture in Britain, 1530 to 1830'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 9th edn., 1993), ISBN 0-300-05886-1, p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt; The new houses built from the late sixteenth century by nobles and [[laird]]s were primarily designed for comfort, not for defence. They retained many of the external features that had become associated with nobility but with a larger ground plan, classically a &quot;Z-plan&quot; of a rectangular block with towers, as at [[Colliston Castle]] (1583) and [[Claypotts Castle]] (1569–88).&lt;ref name=Summerson1993pp502-11/&gt;

[[William Wallace (mason)|William Wallace]], the king's master mason from 1617 until his death in 1631, was particularly influential. He worked on the rebuilding of the collapsed North Range of Linlithgow from 1618, [[Winton House]] for George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton and began work on [[Heriot's Hospital]], Edinburgh. He adopted a distinctive style that applied elements of Scottish fortification and Flemish influences to a Renaissance plan similar to that used at [[Château d'Ancy-le-Franc]]. This style can be seen in lords' houses built at [[Caerlaverock Castle|Caerlaverlock]] (1620), [[Moray House]], Edinburgh (1628) and [[Drumlanrig Castle]] (1675–89), and was highly influential until the Baronial style gave way to the grander English forms associated with [[Inigo Jones]] in the later seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=Summerson1993pp502-11/&gt;{{clear}}

==Commonwealth and Restoration==
{{See also|Palladian architecture}}
[[File:FortAberdeen1661.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of a map of Aberdeen in 1661, showing the fort erected during the Commonwealth]]
During the turbulent era of the [[War of Three Kingdoms|Civil Wars]] and the incorporation of Scotland into a [[Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]], significant building in Scotland was largely confined to military architecture. Polygonal fortresses with triangular bastions in the style of the [[trace italienne]] were built to house English soldiers at [[Ayr]], [[Perth]] and [[Leith]], and 20 smaller forts were built as far apart as [[Orkney]] and [[Stornoway]]. Control of the Highlands was secured by new strongpoints at [[Inverlochy, Highland|Inverlocky]] and [[Inverness]].&lt;ref name=GlendinningMacInnes&amp;MacKechniep70/&gt; The universities saw an improvement in their funding, as they were given income from deaneries, defunct bishoprics and the excise, allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the [[University of Glasgow#High Street|High Street]] in Glasgow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackieetal1991pp225and227-8&quot;&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), ISBN 0140136495, pp. 227–8.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]] in 1660, large-scale building began again, influenced by a growing interest in [[Classicism]].&lt;ref name=GlendinningMacInnes&amp;MacKechniep70&gt;M.

===Palaces and estate houses===
{{Main|Estate houses in Scotland}}
[[File:Kinross House - geograph.org.uk - 1210373.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kinross House]], one of the first Palladian houses in Britain]]
[[Sir William Bruce, 1st Baronet, of Balcaskie|Sir William Bruce]] (c. 1630–1710) is considered &quot;the effective founder of [[classical architecture]] in Scotland&quot; and was the key figure in introducing the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]] to the country. [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–80) was an influential architect who worked in the region of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] in the sixteenth century and whose buildings are characterised by symmetry, fine proportion and formal elements drawn from [[Ancient Greek architecture|Ancient Classical architecture]]. In England the introduction of the Palladian style is associated with [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652). Bruce's architectural style incorporated Palladian elements and was influenced by Jones, but also borrowed from the [[Italian Baroque]] and was most strongly influenced by Sir [[Christopher Wren]]'s (1632–1723) interpretation of the [[Baroque]] in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.

[[James Smith (architect)|James Smith]] (c. 1645–1731) worked as a mason on Bruce's rebuilding of Holyrood Palace. In 1683 he was appointed Surveyor and Overseer of the Royal Works, responsible for the palace's maintenance. With his father-in-law, the master mason [[Robert Mylne (mason)|Robert Mylne]] (1633–1710), Smith worked on [[Caroline Park]] in [[Edinburgh]] (1685), and [[Drumlanrig Castle]] (1680s). Smith's country houses followed the pattern established by William Bruce, with hipped roofs and pedimented fronts, in a plain but handsome Palladian style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colvin1995pp755-8&quot;&gt;H.

By the later seventeenth century both the [[Presbyterian]] and [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]] wings of the [[Church of Scotland|church]] had adopted the modestly sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation.&lt;ref name=Glendinningetal1996p141/&gt; Most had a centralised plan with two or three arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches.&lt;ref name=Glendinningetal1996p141/&gt; As a result there was little of the [[Baroque]] extravagance in church building seen on the continent and England.&lt;ref name=Gifford1989pp.62-7&gt;J. Gifford, ''William Adam 1689–1748'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing/RIAS, 1989), ISBN 1-85158-295-9, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. [[Lauder#Church|Lauder Church]] was built by Bruce in 1673 for the [[Sir William Bruce, 1st Baronet, of Balcaskie|Duke of Lauderdale]], who championed the bishops in the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The Gothic windows may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the existing common framework of new churches.&lt;ref name=Glendinningetal1996p141&gt;M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), ISBN 0-7486-0849-4, p.&amp;nbsp;141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major exceptions to the common Greek cross plan are in the work of Smith, who had become a [[Jesuit]] in his youth.&lt;ref name=Glendinningetal1996p143/&gt; These included the rebuilding of [[Holyrood Abbey]] undertaken for [[James II of England|James VII]] in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir [[George Mackenzie (lawyer)|George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh]], in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]], a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by [[Donato Bramante]] (1444–1514).&lt;ref name=Gifford1989pp.62-7/&gt; The drive to Episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit at the end opposite the entrance. The [[Latin Cross]] form increasingly popular in [[Counter Reformation]] Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's [[Kirk of the Canongate|Canongate Kirk]] (1688–90), but the Presbyterian revolution of 1689–90 occurred before its completion and the chancel was blocked up, effectively transforming it into a T-plan.&lt;ref name=Glendinningetal1996p143&gt;M.

MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), ISBN 0-7486-0849-4, p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early eighteenth century==

After the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union of 1707]], growing prosperity in Scotland led to a spate of new building, both public and private. The threat of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland saw more military building than England in this period. Military structures relied on the strength of inclined and angled engineered masonry and earthen toppings to deflect and absorb artillery fire. This spate of military building culminated in the construction of [[Fort George, Scotland|Fort George]] near Inverness (1748–69), with its projecting [[bastion]]s and [[redoubt]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maxwell2005p26&quot;/&gt;

===Country houses===
{{Main|Estate houses in Scotland}}
Scotland produced some of the most significant architects of the early eighteenth century, including [[Colen Campbell]] (1676–1729), [[James Gibbs]] (1682–1754) and [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] (1689–1748), all of whom were influenced by Classical architecture. Campbell was influenced by the Palladian style and has been credited with founding Georgian architecture. Architectural historian [[Howard Colvin]] has speculated that he was associated with James Smith and may even have been his pupil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colvin1995pp755-8&quot;/&gt; He spent most of his career in Italy and England and developed a rivalry with fellow Scot James Gibbs, who trained in Rome and also practised mainly in England. Campbell's architectural style incorporated Palladian elements, as well as forms from the Italian Baroque and Inigo Jones, but was most strongly influenced by Sir Christopher Wren's interpretation of the Baroque.&lt;ref name=&quot;J. Summerson, 1993 pp. 330&quot;/&gt; [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]], the foremost Scottish architect of his time,&lt;ref&gt;C. McWilliam, ''The Buildings of Scotland: Lothian (except Edinburgh)'' (London: Penguin, 1978), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Glendinning, A. McKechnie, R. McInnes ''Building a Nation: The Story of Scotland's Architecture'' (Canongate, 1999), ISBN 0-86241-830-5, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; designed and built numerous country houses and public buildings. Among his best known works are [[Hopetoun House]] near Edinburgh, and [[Duff House]] in [[Banff, Scotland|Banff]]. His individual, exuberant, style was built on the Palladian style, but with [[baroque architecture|Baroque]] motifs inspired by the work of [[John Vanbrugh]] and Continental architecture. After his death, his sons Robert and John took on the family business and became the leading British architects of the second half of the century.&lt;ref&gt;N.

===Neo-classical churches===

[[File:Saint Andrew's in the Square.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Andrew's in the Square, Glasgow shows the neo-classical influence]]
In the eighteenth century established patterns of church building continued, with T-shaped plans with steeples on the long side, as at New Church, [[Dumfries]] (1724–27), and [[Newbattle]] Parish Church (1727–29). [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]]'s [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]] Parish Church (1729–32), was a Greek cross plan inscribed in a circle, while John Douglas's [[Killin]] Church (1744) was octagonal. Scots-born architect [[James Gibbs]] was highly influential on British ecclesiastical architecture. He introduced a consciously antique style in his rebuilding of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], London, with a massive, steepled [[portico]] and rectangular, side-aisled plan. Similar patterns in Scotland can be seen at [[St Andrew's in the Square]] (1737–59), designed by Allan Dreghorn and built by the master mason Mungo Nasmyth, and at the smaller [[Donibristle]] Chapel (completed in 1731), designed by [[Alexander McGill (architect)|Alexander McGill]]. Gibbs' own design for St. Nicholas West, Aberdeen (1752–55), had the same rectangular plan, with a nave-and-aisles, barrel-vaulted layout with superimposed pedimented front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glendinningetal1996p143&quot;/&gt; After the Toleration Act of 1712, Episcopalians began building a limited number of new chapels including Alexander Jaffray's St Paul's chapel in Aberdeen (1721), the meeting house designed by McGill in Montrose, an Edinburgh chapel opened in 1722 and [[St Andrew's-by-the-Green]] in Glasgow (1750–52), which adopted a simpler version of Gibbs' pedimented rectangular plan.&lt;ref name=Glendinningetal1996p143-4&gt;M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), ISBN 0-7486-0849-4, p.&amp;nbsp;143-4.&lt;/ref&gt;
