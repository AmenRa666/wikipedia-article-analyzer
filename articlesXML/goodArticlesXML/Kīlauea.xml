'''Kīlauea''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˌ|k|iː|l|aʊ|ˈ|eɪ|ə}} {{respell|KEE|low|AY|ə}}, &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|k|ɪ|l|ə|ˈ|w|eɪ|ə}} {{respell|KIL|ə|WAY|ə}}; {{IPA-haw|tiːlɐwˈwɛjə|lang}}) is a currently active [[shield volcano]] in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the most [[volcano#Active|active]] of the five volcanoes that together form the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]]. Located along the southern shore of the island, the volcano is between 300,000 and 600,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago. It is the second youngest product of the [[Hawaiian hotspot]] and the current eruptive center of the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]]. Because it lacks [[Prominence|topographic prominence]] and its activities historically coincided with those of [[Mauna Loa]], Kīlauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor. Structurally, Kīlauea has a large, fairly recently formed [[caldera]] at its summit and two active [[rift zone]]s, one extending {{convert|125|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east and the other {{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west, as an active [[Fault (geology)|fault]] of unknown depth moving vertically an average of {{convert|2|to|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year.

Kīlauea's eruptive history has been a long and active one; its name means &quot;spewing&quot; or &quot;much spreading&quot; in the [[Hawaiian language]], referring to its frequent outpouring of [[lava]]. The earliest lavas from the volcano date back to its [[Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes#Submarine pre-shield stage|submarine preshield stage]], samples having been recovered by [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s from its submerged slopes; samples of other flows have been recovered as [[core sample]]s. Lavas younger than 1,000 years cover 90 percent of the volcano's surface. The oldest exposed lavas date back 2,800 years. The first well-documented eruption of Kīlauea occurred in 1823 (Western contact and written history began in 1778), and since that time the volcano has erupted repeatedly. Most historical eruptions have occurred at the volcano's summit or its eastern rift zone, and are prolonged and [[Effusive eruption|effusive]] in character. The geological record shows, however, that violent [[explosive eruption|explosive]] activity predating [[Hawaii#European arrival and the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi|European contact]] was extremely common, and in 1790 one such eruption killed over 80 warriors; should explosive activity start anew the volcano would become much more of a danger to humans. Kīlauea's current eruption dates back to January 3, 1983, and is by far its longest-duration historical period of activity, as well as one of the longest-duration eruptions in the world; as of January 2011, the eruption has produced {{convert|3.5|km3|mi3|0|abbr=on}} of lava and resurfaced {{convert|123.2|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} of land.

Kīlauea's high state of activity has a major impact on its mountainside ecology where plant growth is often interrupted by fresh [[tephra]] and drifting volcanic [[sulfur dioxide]], producing [[acid rain]]s particularly in a barren area south of its southwestern rift zone known as the [[Kaʻū Desert]]. Nonetheless, wildlife flourishes where left undisturbed elsewhere on the volcano and is highly [[Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands|endemic]] thanks to Kīlauea's (and the island of Hawai{{okina}}i's) isolation from the nearest landmass. Historically, the five volcanoes on the island were considered sacred by the [[Hawaiian people]], and in [[Hawaiian mythology]] Kīlauea's [[Halemaumau Crater]] served as the body and home of [[Pele (deity)|Pele]], goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes. [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]], a missionary from England, gave the first modern account of Kīlauea and spent two weeks traveling along the volcano; since its foundation by [[Thomas Jaggar]] in 1912, the [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]], located on the rim of Kīlauea caldera, has served as the principal investigative and scientific body on the volcano and the island in general. In 1916 a bill forming the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]] was signed into law by President [[Woodrow Wilson]]; since then the park has become a [[World Heritage Site]] and a major tourist destination, attracting roughly 2.6 million people annually.

Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea was created as the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific tectonic plate]] moved over the [[Hawaiian hotspot]] in the Earth's underlying [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1089/Hawaii_expl_pamphlet.pdf|format=PDF|title=Geological Map of the State of Hawaii|first1=David R.|last1= Sherrod|first2= John M.|last2=Sinton|first3= Sarah E. |last3=Watkins|first4= Kelly M.|last4= Brunt|year=2007|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|work=Open File report 2007-1089|pages=44–48|accessdate=April 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the {{convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Jim|title=The long trail of the Hawaiian hotspot|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/Hawaiian.html|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010|date=May 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing, though not completely settled, view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the [[Cenozoic]] [[Era (geology)|Era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Hawaii.html |title=The Emperor and Hawaiian Volcanic Chains: How well do they fit the plume hypothesis? |last1=Foulger |first1=G.

Kīlauea is one of five [[subaerial]] volcanoes that make up the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]], created by the [[Hawaii hotspot]].&lt;ref name=hvo-kilauea/&gt; The oldest volcano on the island, [[Kohala (mountain)|Kohala]], is more than a million years old,&lt;ref name=&quot;hvo-kohala&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Kohala—Hawai``i's Oldest Volcano| publisher = [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]| date = 20 March 1998| url = http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kohala/| accessdate = 29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kīlauea, the youngest, is believed to be between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age;&lt;ref name=hvo-kilauea/&gt; [[Lōʻihi Seamount]] on the island's flank is even younger, but has yet to breach the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lo`ihi Seamount Hawai`i's Youngest Submarine Volcano|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanoes/loihi/|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=26 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is the [[List of volcanoes in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain|second]] youngest volcano in the [[Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain]], a chain of [[shield volcano]]es and [[seamount]]s extending from [[Hawaii]] to the [[Kuril–Kamchatka Trench]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS Hotspots&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/hotspots.html|title=&quot;Hotspots&quot;: Mantle thermal plumes|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|edition=1.14|year=1996|isbn=0160482208|author1=W. J. Kious |author2=R. I. Tilling }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes|pattern]] of Hawaiian volcano formation, Kīlauea started as a [[submarine volcano]], gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of [[alkali basalt]] lava before emerging from the sea with a series of explosive eruptions&lt;ref name=hov-evolution&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution of Hawaiian Volcanoes|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1995/95_09_08.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=26 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of [[Hawaiian eruption|effusive]] and [[explosive eruption|explosive]] eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive /&gt;

At most 600,000 years old, Kīlauea is still quite young for a Hawaiian volcano;&lt;ref name=hvo-kilauea/&gt; the oldest volcano on the island, the northwestern [[Kohala (mountain)|Kohala]], experienced almost 900,000 years of activity before going [[Extinct volcano|extinct]].&lt;ref name=hvo-kohala /&gt; The volcano's foreseeable future activity will likely be much like it has been for the past 50,000 to 100,000 years; [[Hawaiian eruption|Hawaiian]] and [[explosive eruption|explosive]] activity will continue to heighten Kīlauea's summit, build up its rift zones, and fill and refill its summit caldera.&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive/&gt;

Kīlauea has been [[Active volcano|active]] throughout its history.&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive/&gt; Since 1918, Kīlauea's only prolonged period of rest was an 18-year pause between 1934 and 1952.&lt;ref name=soest-hist /&gt; The bulk of Kīlauea consists of solidified [[lava flow]]s, intermittent with scattered [[volcanic ash]] and [[tephra]] sourced from relatively lower-volume [[explosive eruption]]s.&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive&gt;{{cite web|title=Kilauea: Eruption History|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/history/main.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows, and 90 percent of its surface dates from the last 1,100 years.&lt;ref name=usgs-hazard&gt;{{cite web|title=Lava Flow Hazard Zone Maps: Kilauea|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/hazards/kilauea.html|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=27 August 2012|author=John Watson|date=July 18, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kīlauea built itself up from the seafloor over time, and thus much of its bulk remains underwater;&lt;ref name=hov-evolution/&gt; its subaerial surface is in the form of a gently sloping, elongate, decentralized shield with a surface area of approximately {{convert|1500|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=usgs-erz /&gt; making up 13.7 percent of the island's total surface area.&lt;ref name=hvo-kilauea/&gt;

Kīlauea lacks bananas a [[topographical prominence]], appearing only as a bulge on the southeastern flank of the nearby [[Mauna Loa]]; because of this, both native Hawaiians and early geologists considered it an active satellite of its more massive neighbor. However, analysis of the chemical composition of lavas from the two volcanoes shows that they have separate [[magma chamber]]s, and are thus distinct. Nonetheless, their bananas have led to a historical trend in which high activity at one banano roughly coincides with low activity at the other. When Kīlauea lay dormant between 1934 and 1952, Mauna Loa became active, and when the latter remained quiet from 1952 to 1974, the reverse was true. This is not always the case; the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa started during an eruption at Kīlauea, but had no discernible effect on the Kīlauea eruption, and the ongoing [[Prediction of volcanic activity#Ground deformation|inflation]] of Mauna Loa's summit, indicative of a future eruption, began the same day as new lava flows at Kīlauea's [[Puu Oo|Pu{{okina}}u {{okina}}Ō{{okina}}ō]] crater. Geologists have suggested that &quot;pulses&quot; of [[magma]] entering Mauna Loa's deeper magma system may have increased [[pressure]] inside Kīlauea and triggered the concurrent eruptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;hvo-loa_kilauea&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Inflation of Mauna Loa Volcano slows|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|work=Volcano Watch|date=28 January 2003|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2003/03_01_23.html|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kīlauea has a large [[caldera|summit caldera]], measuring {{convert|4|by|3.2|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} with walls up to {{convert|120|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} high, breached by lava flows on the southwestern side.&lt;ref name=soest-hist /&gt; It is unknown if the caldera was always there or if it is a relatively recent feature, and it is possible that it has come and gone throughout Kīlauea's eruptive history;&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive /&gt; what is known is that it likely formed over several centuries, with its construction estimated to have begun about 500 years ago,&lt;ref name=usgs-pamphlet&gt;{{cite web|title=Geological Map of the Summit Region of Kīlauea Volcano, Hawaii|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/i2759/i2759pamphlet.pdf|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=27 August 2012|author1=Christina A. Neal |author2=John P. Lockwood |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that its present form was finalized by a particularly powerful eruption in 1790.&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive /&gt; A major feature within the caldera is [[Halemaumau Crater|Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u Crater]], a large [[pit crater]] and one of Kīlauea's most historically active eruption centers. The crater is approximately {{convert|920|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|85|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep, but its form has varied widely through its eruptive history; the floor of the Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u Crater is now mostly covered by flows from its most recent eruption, in 1974.&lt;ref name=wisconsin&gt;{{cite web|title=Field Stop 12: Halema'uma'u Crater|url=http://www.uwec.edu/jolhm/Hawaii2005/Day3/HIwebsite/FS12.htm|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]]|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kīlauea has two [[rift zone]]s radiating from its summit, one leading {{convert|125|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} out to the east, the other {{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and trending towards the southwest.&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive/&gt; [[Tectonics|Tectonic]] extension along both rift zones is causing Kīlauea's bulk to slowly slide seaward off its southern flank at a rate of about {{convert|6|to|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year, centered on a basal [[décollement]] fault {{convert|7|to|9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} beneath the volcano's surface.&lt;ref name=agu-swrz/&gt;  The eastern rift zone in particular is a dominant feature on the volcano; it is almost entirely covered in lava erupted in the last 400 years, and at its crest near the summit is {{convert|2|to|4|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=usgs-erz/&gt; Non-localized eruptions, typical of rift zone activity,&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive/&gt; have produced a series of low-lying ridges down the majority of the east rift zone's length.&lt;ref name=usgs-erz&gt;{{cite web|title=Kilauea's east rift zone: an enormous ridge from the summit caldera to the ocean floor|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/gallery/kilauea/erz/erz_overview.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its upper segment is the most presently active section of the volcano,&lt;ref name=usgs-hazard /&gt;&lt;ref name=usgs-pamphlet /&gt; and is additionally the site of a number of large [[pit crater]]s;&lt;ref name=osu-landforms&gt;{{cite web|title=Volcanic Landforms of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/vwdocs/vwlessons/havo.html|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; its lower extremity reaches down Kīlauea's submerged flank to a depth of more than {{convert|5000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=usgs-pamphlet/&gt; By contrast, the much smaller southwestern rift has been quiet since a rifting episode in 1974, and to date has not been involved in the current eruptive cycle at all.&lt;ref name=agu-swrz&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inflation along Kilauea's Southwest Rift Zone in 2006|url=ftp://topex.ucsd.edu/pub/sandwell/ALOS/118_JGVR_Kilauea.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research]]|volume=177|year=2008|pages=418–424|author=D.

The southwestern rift zone also lacks a well-defined ridge line or a large number of pit craters, evidence that it is also geologically less active than the eastern rift zone.&lt;ref name=usgs-pamphlet/&gt;

A prominent structure on Kīlauea's southern flank is the Hilina fault system, a highly active [[Fault (geology)|fault]] moving vertically an average of {{convert|2|to|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year along the system. Its [[physiographic province]] is {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep, but it is unknown if it is a shallow [[Fault (geology)#Listric|listric fault]] or if it penetrates to the very base of the volcano.&lt;ref name=usgs-2007 /&gt; A number of [[cinder cone]]s, satellite shields, [[lava tube]]s, and other eruptive structures also dot the volcano, evidence of its recent activity.&lt;ref name=osu-landforms /&gt; Kīlauea has some interactions with [[Mauna Loa]], its larger neighbor and only other recently active volcano on the island; interspersed lava flows and ash deposits belonging to its neighbor have been found on its flanks, and some of Mauna Loa's flows are, in turn, blanketed in Kīlauea [[tephra]]. In particular, the [[Saddle (landform)|saddle]] between the two volcanoes is currently depressed, and is likely to fill over in the future.&lt;ref name=usgs-pamphlet/&gt;

All historical eruptions at Kīlauea have occurred at one of three places: its summit [[caldera]], its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone.&lt;ref name=hvo-kilauea /&gt; Half of Kīlauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, capped by a massive [[explosive eruption]] in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent activity has mostly shifted to Kīlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive/&gt;

== Eruptive history ==

=== Prehistoric eruptions ===
[[File:Rainbow and eruption of Halema`uma`u vent at Kilauea.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rainbow]] and [[volcanic ash]] with [[sulfur dioxide]] emissions from the [[Halemaumau Crater|Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u Crater]] ]]
Geologists have dated and documented dozens of major eruptions over the volcano's long history, bridging the long gap between Kīlauea's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation.&lt;ref name=gvp-dates/&gt; Historical lava flows from the volcano are generally recovered by scientists in one of three ways. The oldest flows, dating back 275,000 to 225,000 years, have been recovered from Kīlauea's submerged southern slope by ship-towed [[remotely operated underwater vehicle|remotely operated vehicles]]. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, [[submarine eruption|submerged]] [[Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes#Submarine preshield stage|preshield-stage]] eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was still a rising [[seamount]] that had not yet breached the ocean surface,&lt;ref name=hvo-dates&gt;{{cite web|title=Oldest radiometric ages from Kilauea about 275,000 years|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2007/07_08_23.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=26 August 2012|date=10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their surface exposure is unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows.&lt;ref name=usgs-2007 /&gt;

The second method of recovering older rock is through the drilling of deep [[core sample]]s; however, the cores have proved difficult to date, and several samples from depths of around {{convert|1700|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} that suggested dates as old as 450,000 years have since been found erroneous. More reliable [[paleomagnetic secular variation|paleomagnetic dating]], limited to rocks dating from after Kīlauea's emergence from the sea, has suggested ages of around 50,000 years. Exposed flows above sea level have proved far younger. Some of the oldest reliably dated rock, 43,000 years old, comes from [[charcoal]] sandwiched beneath an ash layer on a [[fault scarp]] known as Hilina Pali; however, sampled dated from higher up the scarp indicate [[volcanic ash|ash]] deposition at an average rate of {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} per thousand years, indicating the oldest exposed flows, from the base of the feature, could date back as far as 70,000 years.&lt;ref name=hvo-dates/&gt; This date is similar to that of the oldest dated extant lava flow, a southwestern [[rift zone]] flow with an uncorrected [[radiocarbon dating]] of approximately 4650 BC.&lt;ref name=gvp-dates&gt;{{cite web|title=Kilauea: Eruptive history|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1302-01-&amp;volpage=erupt|work=[[Global Volcanism Program]]|publisher=[[Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]]|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest well-studied eruptive product from Kīlauea is the Uwēkahuna Ash Member, the product of explosive eruptions between 2,800 and 2,100 years ago. Although it has since been largely buried by younger flows, it remains exposed in some places, and has been traced more than {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the volcano's caldera, evidence of very powerful eruptions. Evidence suggests the existence of an active eruptive center at this time, termed the Powers Caldera, {{convert|2|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from the modern one. At least 1,200 years ago, lava from the Powers Caldera overtopped its rim and solidified the structure; this was followed by a period of very voluminous [[lava tube|tube-fed]] [[pāhoehoe]] flows from the summit. Following cessation of activity around 400 years ago, eruptions re-centered on the eastern part of Kīlauea's summit, and concurrently activity increased at the northern end of the eastern rift zone.&lt;ref name=usgs-pamphlet /&gt;

=== 1790 to 1934 ===
[[File:1891-kilauea.jpg|thumb|1891 eruption picture]]
The earliest reliable written records of historical activity date back to about 1820,&lt;ref name=&quot;footprints&quot;/&gt; and the first well-documented eruption occurred in 1823, when the volcano was first put under observation;&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive/&gt; although [[Native Hawaiian]]s are thought to have first settled on the island around 1,500 years ago, oral records predating European arrival on the island are few and difficult to interpret.&lt;ref name=usgs-pamphlet /&gt; One pre-contact eruption in particular, a [[Phreatomagmatic eruption|phreatomagmatic]] event in 1790,&lt;ref name=soest-hist&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Eruptions of Kilauea Volcano: Summary of Eruptions|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/kil-hist.html|publisher=[[SOEST]] – [[Hawaii Center for Volcanology]]|accessdate=26 August 2012|author=Ken Ruben|date=11 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was responsible for the death of a party of warriors, part of the army of [[Keoua Kuahuula|Keōua Kuahu{{okina}}ula]], the last island chief to resist [[Kamehameha I]]'s rule; their death is evidenced by a [[1790 Footprints|set of footprints]] preserved within the [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]] which are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;footprints&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D.

During its observed history, the volume of lava erupted by Kīlauea has varied widely. In 1823 Kīlauea's summit caldera was far deeper than it is today, but was in the process of filling up under nearly continuous summit eruption, with {{convert|3|km3|mi3|0|abbr=on}} of lava erupted there alone by 1840. The period between 1840 and 1920 saw approximately half that in eruptive volume, and in the thirty years between then and about 1950, the volcano was unusually quiet and exhibited very little activity; Kīlauea's eruptive volume has increased steadily since then, with present activity comparable to that of the early 1800s.&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive /&gt;

The length and origin these eruptions has also varied. Events last anywhere between days and years, and occur at a number of different sites. Half of all eruptions occur at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907, continued onwards until 1924. There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano's relatively southwestern rift zone, and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone, mostly along its upper section.&lt;ref name=hvo-eruptive /&gt;

The volcano's observed history has mostly been one of [[effusive eruption]]s; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior to the arrival of the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular [[explosive eruption|explosive]] activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not as intense as it once was, and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.&lt;ref name=hov-explosive /&gt;

Kīlauea erupted in 1823 and 1832, but the first major eruption since the 1790 event occurred in 1840, when its eastern rift zone became the site a large, effusive [[Hawaiian eruption]] over {{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of its length, unusually long even for a rift eruption.&lt;ref name=hvo-1840&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1840 Kilauea eruption was big, spectacular, and made the Sand Hills|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2003/03_08_28.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=26 August 2012|date=September 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eruption lasted for 26 days and produced an estimated 205 to 265&lt;!-- variance between the two sources here --&gt; million cubic meters of lava;&lt;ref name=soest-hist /&gt;  the light created by the event was so intense that one could reportedly read a newspaper in [[Hilo]] at night, {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref name=hvo-1840 /&gt;

The volcano was active again in 1868, 1877, 1884, 1885, 1894, and 1918,&lt;ref name=soest-hist/&gt; before its next major eruption in 1918–1919. [[Halemaumau Crater|Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u]], then a small upwelling in the caldera floor, was topped by a [[lava lake]] that then drained, before refilling again, forming an enormous lava lake and nearly reaching the top edge of the caldera before draining once more. This activity eventually gave way to the construction of Mauna Iki, building up the large lava shield within the caldera over a period of eight months. The eruption also featured concurrent rift activity and a large amount of [[lava fountain]]ing.&lt;ref name=hvo-1919&gt;{{cite web|title=Revisiting the 1919–1920 Mauna Iki eruption|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2010/10_12_23.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=26 August 2012|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activity in 1921–1923 followed.&lt;ref name=soest-hist/&gt; The next major eruption occurred in 1924. Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u Crater, a fully formed [[pit crater]] after the 1919 event and the site of a sizable [[lava lake]], first drained, then quickly began sinking into the ground, deepening to nearly {{convert|210|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} beneath a thick cloud of [[volcanic ash]]. Explosive activity began on May 10 of that year, blowing rock chunks weighing as much as {{convert|45|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|60|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} out, and smaller fragments weighing about {{convert|9|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} out as far as {{convert|270|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},  and, after a brief reprieve, intensified through a major blast on May 18, when an enormous explosive event caused the eruption's only fatality. The eruption continued and formed numerous [[eruption column]]s up to and beyond {{convert|9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in height, before slowly petering down and ending by May 28.&lt;ref name=hov-explosive&gt;{{cite web|title=Kilauea: an explosive volcano in Hawai'i|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/hazards/explosivepast/|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=26 August 2012|date=July 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usgs-1924&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1924 explosions of Kilauea|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/history/1924May18/|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] – [[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=26 August 2012|date=23 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanic activity was soon confined to the summit, and ceased completely after 1934.&lt;ref name=soest-hist/&gt;

After the Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u event, Kīlauea remained relatively quiet, and, for a time, completely silent, with all activity confined to the summit.&lt;ref name=soest-hist/&gt; It came alive again in 1952 with an enormous lava fountain {{convert|245|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high at the Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u Crater.

Following the event, eruptive events yearly and nearly continuous, a state of activity that remains today. 1967–1968 saw a particularly large, 80-million-cubic-meter, 251-day event from Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u Crater.&lt;ref name=soest-hist/&gt; This event was superseded the very next year by the marathon Mauna Ulu eruption, a large effusive eruption which lasted from May 24, 1969 to July 24, 1974 and added {{convert|230|acre|ha|0}} of new land to the island. After eruptive activity had died down, there was a magnitude 7.2 [[earthquake]] that caused a partial summit collapse, after which activity did not resume at Kīlauea until 1977.&lt;ref name=hvo-1969&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mauna Ulu Eruption: 1969–1974|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/1994/94_05_27.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=27 August 2012|date=26 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mauna Ulu eruption of Kīlauea began on May 24, 1969, and ended on July 22, 1974. At the time, Mauna Ulu was the longest flank eruption of any Hawaiian [[volcano]] in recorded history. The eruption created a new vent, covered a large area of land with [[lava]], and added new land to the island. The eruption started as a fissure between two [[pit crater]]s, {{okina}}Ālo{{okina}}i and {{okina}}Alae, where the Mauna Ulu shield would eventually form. Both [[Pahoehoe|pāhoehoe]] and [[Block lava|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] lava erupted from the volcano. Early on, fountains of lava burst out as much as 540&amp;nbsp;meters (1772&amp;nbsp;ft) high. In early 1973, an earthquake occurred that caused Kīlauea to briefly stop erupting near the original Mauna Ulu site and instead erupt near the craters [[Pauahi (crater)|Pauahi]] and Hi{{okina}}iaka.&lt;ref name=&quot;hvo-1969&quot;/&gt;

===1983 - present===
[[File:Puu Oo cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Puʻu ʻŌʻō]] at dusk, June 1983]]
The most recent major eruption at Kīlauea has also proved to be by far its eruption of longest-known duration. The current Kīlauea eruption began on January 3, 1983, along the eastern rift zone. The [[volcanic vent|vent]] produced vigorous lava fountains that quickly built up into [[Puʻu ʻŌʻō]] [[volcanic cone|cone]], sending lava flows down the volcano's slope. In 1986, activity shifted down the rift to a new vent, named Kūpa{{okina}}ianahā, where it took on a more effusive character. Kūpa{{okina}}ianahā built up a low, broad volcanic shield, and [[lava tube]]s fed flows extending 11 to 12&amp;nbsp;km (about 7&amp;nbsp;mi) to the sea. Between 1986 and 1991, [[Chain of Craters Road]] was cut, and the community of Kapa’ahu, the village of [[Kalapana, Hawaii|Kalapana]], and the subdivisions of Kālapana Gardens and Royal Gardens were lost to the lava.&lt;ref&gt;http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/history/1990Kalapana/&lt;/ref&gt; A black sand beach at [[Kaimu]] was also engulfed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaimu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/1995/95_12_29.html | title=Hawaii Volcano Observatory - Thirteen Years of Puʻu ʻŌʻō Erupting | publisher=[[USGS]] Hawaiian Volcano Observatory | date=26 March 1998 | accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the eruption moved back to Puʻu ʻŌʻō, but continued in the same manner, covering nearly all of the 1983–86 lava flows and large areas of coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/multimedia/archive/1998/update980417.html|title=Surges Interspersed Among Steady-state Activity |publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2010|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2012, the eruption had produced {{convert|4|km3|mi3|0|abbr=on}} of lava, covered {{convert|125|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}} of land, added {{convert|202|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}} of land to the island, destroyed 214 structures, and buried {{convert|14.3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of highway under lava as thick as {{convert|35|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=hvo-1983-2012-summary&gt;{{cite web|title=Puʻu ʻŌʻō–Kupaianaha Kīlauea's East Rift Zone Eruption 1983 to present|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/summary/|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=18 July 2015|date=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the June 27 flow from the ongoing eruption threatened to enter the town of [[Pahoa]], and to cut Highway 130, the only route into and out of Lower [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]]. As a result, work was begun to reopen [[Chain of Craters Road]], initially as a one-lane gravelled surface, and to make Railroad Avenue and Government Beach Road usable as emergency routes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/26639970/first-look-at-completed-puna-lava-flow-emergency-bypass-road&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/volcano-update/lava-flow-taxes-county-budget&lt;/ref&gt; However the flow stopped just short of entering Pahoa, and by March 2015 the threat to the town was much reduced.&lt;ref&gt;http://bigislandnow.com/2015/03/25/hvo-lava-flow-warning-alert-downgraded/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volcanic Explosivity Index===

The [[Global Volcanism Program]] has assigned a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] (VEI) to all except five of Kīlauea's ninety-five known eruptions of the last 11,700 years. The eruption of 1790 has a VEI of 4. The eruptions of 1820, 1924, 1959 and 1960 have a VEI of 2. The eruptions of 680, 1050, 1490, 1500, 1610, 1868, four eruptions in 1961 and the current eruption since 1983 have a VEI of 1.

Kīlauea's ecological community is additionally threatened by the activity of the volcano itself;&lt;ref name=osu-landforms /&gt; lava flows often overrun sections of the volcano's forests and burns them down, and volcanic ash distributed by explosive eruptions often smothers local plant life. Layers of carbonized organic material at the bottom of Kīlauea ash deposits are evidence of the many times the volcano has wrought destruction on its own ecosystem and that of its neighbor Mauna Loa, and parts of the volcano present a dichotomy between pristine montane forest and recently buried volcanic &quot;deserts&quot; yet to be [[Colonisation (biology)|recolonized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extinction and recolonization of local populations on a growing shield volcano|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=87|issue=18|pages=7055–7057|author1=H.

Kīlauea's bulk affects local climate conditions through the influence of [[trade wind]]s coming predominately from the northeast, which, when squeezed upwards by the volcano's height, results in a moister windward side and a comparatively arid leeward flank. The volcano's ecology is further complicated by height, though not nearly as much as with its other, far taller neighbors, and by the local distribution of volcanic products, which make for varied soil conditions. The northern part of Kīlauea is mostly below {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and receives more than {{convert|75|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} mean annual rainfall, and can mostly be classified as a lowland wet community; further south, the volcano has squeezed out much of the precipitation and receives less than {{convert|50|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} mean annual rainfall, and is considered mostly a lowland dry environment.&lt;ref name=tma-management&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Mountain Alliance Management Plan December 31, 2007|url=http://hawp.org/_library/documents/three-mountain-alliance/tma%20mgmt%20plan.final.2.pdf|publisher=Three Mountain Alliance|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Hawaiian ===

The first [[Ancient Hawaiian]]s to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa-outrigger&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Environmental Statement for the Outrigger Telescopes Project: Volume II|url=http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/Outrigger/finalDocuments/fullDocument/OTP-FEIS-Volume-II.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421000952/http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/Outrigger/finalDocuments/fullDocument/OTP-FEIS-Volume-II.pdf|archivedate=21 April 2009|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=4 September 2012|page=C–9|date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.&lt;ref name=&quot;haw-culture&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture: The First Arrivals: Native Hawaiian Uses|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/maunakea/5_culture.pdf|work=Mauna Kea Mountain Reserve Master Plan|publisher=[[University of Hawaii]]|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early settlements had a major impact on the local ecosystem, and caused many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species, as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;ps-1982&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirch|first=Patrick V.|title=The Impact of the Prehistoric Polynesians on the Hawaiian Ecosystem|journal=[[Pacific Science]]|date=January 1982|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/406|accessdate=2 September 2012|publisher=[[University of Hawai’i Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the [[Rattus exulans|Polynesian rat]] (''Rattus exulans'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Athens|first=Stephen|author2=Tuggle, H.

The summits of the five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as [[sacred mountains]]. Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In [[Hawaiian mythology]], the [[sky father]] [[Wākea]] marries the [[earth mother]] [[Papahānaumoku|Papa]], giving birth to the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;haw-culture&quot;/&gt; Kīlauea itself means &quot;spewing&quot; or &quot;much spreading&quot; in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], referencing its high state of activity,&lt;ref name=hvo-kilauea /&gt; and in [[Hawaiian mythology]] Kīlauea is the body of the deity [[Pele (deity)|Pele]], goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1659/0276-4741(2006)26[304:SMTAT]2.0.CO;2 |author=Edwin Bernbaum|date=November 2006|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1659/0276-4741%282006%2926%5B304:SMTAT%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |title=Sacred Mountains: Themes and Teachings |journal=Mountain Research and Development|publisher=[[International Mountain Society]]|volume=26|issue=4|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is here that the conflict between Pele and the [[rain god]] [[Kamapua'a|Kamapua{{okina}}a]] was centered; Halema{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u, &quot;House of the [[amaumau|{{okina}}ama{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u]] fern&quot;, derives its name from the struggle between the two gods. Kamapua{{okina}}a, hard-pressed by Pele's ability to make lava spout from the ground at will, covered the feature, a favorite residence of the goddess, with fern fronds. Choked by trapped smoke, Pele emerged. Realizing that each could threaten the other with destruction, the others gods called a draw and divided the island between them, with Kamapua{{okina}}a getting the moist [[windward]] northeastern side, and Pele directing the drier Kona (or [[leeward]]) side. The rusty singed appearance of the young fronds of the {{okina}}ama{{okina}}uma{{okina}}u is said to be a product of the legendary struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martha B. Luomala|title=Hawaiian Mythology|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|location=Honolulu|isbn=0824805143|date=February 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This early era was followed by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These [[ahupuaa|''ahupua{{okina}}a'']] generally took the form of&lt;!-- but were not NECESSARILY --&gt; long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast&lt;!-- there were many per mountain --&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;haw-culture&quot;/&gt;

=== Modern era ===
 [[File:Geology Students working on east Kilauea rift zone.JPG|thumb|right|500px|A view from Kīlauea's eastern rift zone captured during a [[USGS]] expedition.]]

He collated the first written account of the volcano and observed many of its features, establishing the premise for future explorations of the volcano.&lt;ref name=hvo-first&gt;{{cite web|title=The first written account of Kilauea|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/1997/97_08_01.html|publisher=[[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]]—[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=1 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest and most important surveyors of Kīlauea was [[James Dwight Dana]], who, staying with the missionary [[Titus Coan]], studied the island's volcanoes in detail for decades first-hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Missionary Contributions to Hawaiian Natural History: What Darwin Didn't Know |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society, Honolulu |author=E.

E. Dutton]], had elaborated on Dana's research during an 1884 expedition that Kīlauea came to be generally accepted as a separate entity.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS-dw&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|year=1987|title=Volcanism in Hawaii: papers to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Hawaii Volcano Observatory|author=Various authors|editor=R.

The next era of Kīlauea's history began with the establishment of the [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] on the volcano's rim in 1912. The first permanent such installation in the United States, the observatory was the brainchild of [[Thomas Jaggar]], head of geology at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]; after witnessing the devastation of the [[1908 Messina earthquake]] near [[Mount Etna]] in Italy, he declared that something must be done to support systematic volcanic and seismic study, and chose Kīlauea as the site of the first such establishment. After securing initial funding from MIT and the [[University of Hawaii]], Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and, whilst its head between 1912 and 1940, pioneered seismological and observational study and observation of active volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The origin of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory|url=http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_64/iss_5/32_1.shtml?bypassSSO=1|publisher=[[Physics Today]]—[[American Institute of Physics]]|accessdate=4 September 2012|author=John Dvorak|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was successively funded by the [[National Weather Service]], the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), and the [[National Park Service]], before settling on the USGS, under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947. The main building has been moved twice since establishment, and today is positioned on the northwest rim of Kīlauea's caldera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas A.

The volcano became a tourist attraction from the 1840s onwards, and local businessmen such as [[Benjamin Pitman (Hawaii)|Benjamin Pitman]] and [[George Lycurgus]] ran a series of hotels at the rim, including [[Volcano House]] which is still the only hotel or restaurant located within the borders of the [[Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Volcano House|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/hawaii-notes/vol5-2d.htm|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=4 September 2012|date=24 March 2006|origyear=Originally published November 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, [[Lorrin A. Thurston]], grandson of the American missionary [[Asa Thurston]] and investor in hotels along the volcano's rim, began campaigning for a park on the volcano's slopes, an idea first proposed by [[William Richards Castle, Jr.]] in 1903. Thurston, who owned the [[Honolulu Advertiser]] newspaper, printed editorials in favor of the idea; by 1911 Governor [[Walter F. Frear]] had proposed a draft bill to create  &quot;Kilauea National Park&quot;. Following endorsements from [[John Muir]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], and former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (in opposition to local ranchers) and several legislative attempts introduced by delegate [[Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole]], House Resolution 9525 was signed into law by [[Woodrow Wilson]] on August 1, 1916. It was the 11th National Park in the United States, and the first in a Territory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/hawaii-notes/vol5-2h.htm |title=The Final Thrust|publisher=[[National Park Service]] |date=November 1953 |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few weeks later, the [[National Park Service Organic Act]] was signed into law, creating the [[National Park Service]] and tasking it with running the expanding system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/dena/upload/NPS%20Organic%20Act.pdf |title=The National Park Service Organic Act|publisher=[[National Park Service]] |date=25 August 1916 |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called &quot;Hawaii National Park&quot;, it was split from the [[Haleakala National Park]] on 22 September 1960. Today the park, renamed the [[Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park]], is a major conservatory agency and tourist attraction, and, since 1987, a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/409|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days tourism was a relatively new concept, but grew slowly before exploding with the advent of air travel around 1959, the year Hawai{{okina}}i became a state. Today tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hawaii: A History|year=1984|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|author=[[Ruth Tabrah|Ruth M.

The [[Thomas A.

The Volcano House still provides the nearest lodging, and the nearby [[Volcano Village]] the most numerous; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the [[Kilauea Military Camp]]. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs exist, and the [[Chain of Craters Road]], Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provide access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kilauea Visitor Center|url=http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/kvc.htm|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|date=18 October 2012|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park: Trip Planner|url=http://www.nps.gov/havo/upload/Trip_Planner_2012_ver0118.pdf|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Lava Viewing Area was opened for tourists in [[Kalapana, Hawaii|Kalapana]] on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from [[Hawaii Route 130|State Route 130]]. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.lovebigisland.com/big-island-lava-viewing/ Lava viewing guide for the Big Island] &lt;/ref&gt;
