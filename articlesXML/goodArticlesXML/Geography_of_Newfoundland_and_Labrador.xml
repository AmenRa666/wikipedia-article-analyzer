[[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is the easternmost province in Canada. The [[Strait of Belle Isle]] separates the province into two geographical divisions, [[Labrador]] and the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sve&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/landscape.html|title=Landscape (of Newfoundland and Labrador)|last=Bell|first=Trevor|author2=Liverman, David |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province also includes over seven thousand small islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/islands.html |title=Atlas of Canada: Sea islands |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada) |accessdate=2008-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122002132/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/islands.html |archivedate=January 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labrador is the easternmost part of the [[Canadian Shield]], a vast area of ancient [[metamorphic rock]] comprising much of northeastern North America. Colliding [[plate tectonic|tectonic]] plates have shaped much of the geology of Newfoundland. [[Gros Morne National Park]] has a reputation of being an outstanding example of tectonics at work,&lt;ref name=&quot;just&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/pm-wh/rspm-whsr/rapports-reports/r3_e.asp|title=Report on the State of Conservation of Gros Morne National Park|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such has been designated a [[World Heritage Site]]. The [[Long Range Mountains]] on Newfoundland's west coast are the northeasternmost extension of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sve&quot;/&gt;

The fauna of Labrador is typical of that of similar areas of North America while the island of Newfoundland has considerably fewer mammals and no native amphibians.&lt;ref name=mamm/&gt;

The north-south extent of the province (46°36'N to 60°22'N), prevalent westerly winds, cold ocean currents and local factors such as mountains and coastline combine to create the various climates of the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;tre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/climate.html|title=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Web Site: Climate |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Labrador is classified as a [[Polar region|polar]] [[tundra]] climate, southern Labrador is considered to be a [[subarctic climate]] while most of Newfoundland would be considered to be a cool summer subtype of a [[humid continental climate]].

The provincial capital is [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], located at the extreme eastern edge of the island on the [[Avalon Peninsula]]. About half of the province's economy is based on its abundant natural resources, notably petroleum, minerals, forestry and the fishery.&lt;ref name=&quot;econ&quot;/&gt;

== Physical geography ==
Newfoundland is roughly triangular, with each side being approximately {{convert|500|km|mi|sp=us}}, and having an area of {{convert|108,860|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas&quot;/&gt; Newfoundland and its associated small islands have a total area of {{convert|111,390|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NF gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.nf.ca/aboutnl/area.htm|title=About Newfoundland and Labrador: Land Area|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland extends between latitudes 46°36'N and 51°38'N.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/nfldhistory/Newfoundland%20geography.html|title=Newfoundland Geography|last=Bélanger|first=Claude|publisher= Marianopolis College|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cde&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlbusiness.ca/aboutnl/location.html|title=Location and Climate|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2008-06-16|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620104152/http://www.nlbusiness.ca/aboutnl/location.html |archivedate = June 20, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labrador is an irregular shape: the western part of its border with [[Quebec]] is the [[drainage divide]] for the [[Labrador Peninsula]]. Lands drained by rivers that flow into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are part of Labrador, the rest belongs to Quebec. Labrador’s extreme northern tip, at 60°22'N, shares a short border with [[Nunavut]] on [[Killiniq Island]]. Labrador’s area (including associated small islands) is {{convert|294,330|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NF gov&quot;/&gt; Together, Newfoundland and Labrador make up 4.06% of Canada’s area.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas area&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/surfareas.html|title= Atlas of Canada: Land and Freshwater Areas |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada)|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island of Newfoundland is separated from Labrador by the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], which is {{convert|125|km|mi}} long and from {{convert|60|to|15|km|mi}} wide. In addition to the island of Newfoundland, the province is made up of 12 larger islands with a total area of {{convert|2505|km2|sqmi}} and 7,170 smaller islands with a total area of {{convert|3598|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas&quot;/&gt;

{{See also|Islands of Newfoundland and Labrador}}

== Geology ==

A large part of the island of Newfoundland is an extension of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sve&quot;/&gt; Major bays, peninsulas, river systems and mountain ranges are typically oriented southwest to northeast, parallel to the Appalachians.&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot;/&gt;

The eastern part of the island, (the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and [[Burin Peninsula]]), is mostly folded sedimentary rocks with some intrusions of igneous rock and was part of southwestern Europe or Northern Africa about 250 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;sve&quot;/&gt; The oldest rocks are [[Precambrian]]. Small remnants of [[Cambrian]] and [[Ordovician]] rocks occur along the coast. [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]] in [[Conception Bay]] is a good example of gently sloping Ordovician sedimentary rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1SEC892567#SEC892576|title=Newfoundland and Labrador: Land and Resources|publisher=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plateau in the [[Avalon Peninsula]] averages {{convert|250|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;

The rest of the island is composed of a great variety of [[Paleozoic]] rocks of sedimentary, igneous and [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] origin. Along the west coast lie the [[Long Range Mountains]], which are formed by an elongated block of the Earth's crust (a [[Horst (geology)|horst]]) which rises to about {{convert|600|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; This part of the island was once part of the eastern margin of continental North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;sve&quot;/&gt; The island's highest points, the [[Lewis Hills]] and  [[Gros Morne National Park|Gros Morne]] are located within this mountain range. To the east is a depression or [[graben]] about {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us}} wide, which is occupied by [[Deer Lake (Newfoundland)|Deer Lake]] and [[Grand Lake (Newfoundland)|Grand Lake]]. The main plateau of the central part of the island, which was once the sea bottom of the ancient [[Iapetus Ocean]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sve&quot;/&gt; has been heavily eroded by water and ice. Steep, solitary rock knobs, called &quot;tolts&quot; in Newfoundland (elsewhere known as [[inselberg]]s or [[monadnock]]s), which jut {{convert|100|m|ft}} or more above the generally flat terrain are the remnants of a former higher landscape level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/topsail.html|title=Tolts (rocky knobs) or inselbergs|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glaciers]] which helped shape these tolts left other evidence around Newfoundland. Large blocks of stone called [[glacial erratic]]s have been left scattered across much of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/mines&amp;en/geosurvey/education/features/glacial/|title=Glacial features: Glacial erratics|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long narrow lakes of the west coast, notably those in [[Gros Morne National Park]] resulted from glacial erosion. The lack of good soil on most parts of the island is a result of the scouring effect of glaciers during the most recent [[Last Glacial Maximum|ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/mines&amp;amp;en/geosurvey/InformationPaper.pdf|title=Role of the Geological Survey (pdf)|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2008-07-18}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland's nickname, &quot;The Rock&quot;, is partially a result of the ice ages.
[[File:Western Brook Pond.JPG|left|thumb|[[Western Brook Pond Fjord|Western Brook Pond]] is a [[fjord]] within [[Gros Morne National Park]] which resulted from glacial erosion.]]
One of the most noteworthy aspects of Newfoundland geology is a result of the constant movement of [[plate tectonic|tectonic]] plates. Approximately 500&amp;nbsp;million years ago the action of these plates forced parts of the oceanic crust beneath the Iapetus Ocean up and over the eastern margin of the North American plate.&lt;ref name=&quot;parkcan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/nl/grosmorne/natcul/natcul2_e.asp|title= Gros Morne National Park: The Story in Stone|publisher= Parks Canada|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/geology.html|title=Geological landscape|last=Bell|first=Trevor|author2=Liverman, David |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sections of oceanic crust which overlie continental crust are known as [[ophiolites]]. [[Gros Morne National Park]] was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] because it is one of the best places in the world to see the effects of plate tectonics&lt;ref name=&quot;just&quot;/&gt; and one of the few places where rocks formed at the [[Mohorovicic Discontinuity]] between the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] of the Earth can be seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;parkcan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/grosmorn.html|title=Protected Areas and World Heritage|publisher= United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=2008-06-17}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable geology site is at [[Mistaken Point]], where rocks containing probably the oldest [[metazoan]] [[fossil]]s in North America and the most ancient deep-water marine fossils in the world are found preserved in layers of [[volcanic ash]].&lt;ref name=&quot;msp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vendian/mistaken.html|title=Localities of the Vendian: Mistaken Point, Newfoundland |last=Waggoner|first=Ben|author2=Smith, Dave|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labrador is the easternmost part of the [[Canadian Shield]] and is composed of ancient [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks]]. The interior is averages about {{convert|450|m|ft}} above sea level and is cut by large, east-flowing rivers, such as the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] and its tributaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot;/&gt; The northern coast is largely mountainous. The [[Torngat Mountains]], [[Kaumajet Mountains]] and [[Kiglapait Mountains]] dominate this area with the highest peak being [[Mount Caubvick]] at {{convert|1652|m|ft}}. [[Torngat Mountains National Park Reserve]] was created in 2005 to preserve part of this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gc.ca/pn-np/nl/torngats/index_e.asp|title=Torngat Mountains National Park Reserve|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biosphere ==
The '''[[biosphere]]''' is subdivided into distinct geographical regions called [[biome]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/biosphere.html|title=Newfoundland and Labrador Biosphere|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland and Labrador are divided into two biomes: [[tundra]]  and [[taiga]]. Northern Labrador is part of the tundra, while southern Labrador is part of the taiga. Newfoundland is not typical of either biome, as it lacks much of the plant and animal life that are characteristic to these biomes. During the last [[Last Glacial Maximum|ice age]] the island of Newfoundland was completely covered by glaciers and swept clean of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;/&gt; Only those species which were able to recolonize the island after the glaciers retreated about 18,000 years ago are considered &quot;native&quot;. Similarly, only freshwater-fish capable of surviving [[seawater]] swam to the island. Labrador has 42 native mammals, Newfoundland is home only to 14, with no snakes, raccoons, skunks or porcupines.&lt;ref name=&quot;mamm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/snp/Education/LandMammals.htm|title=Land Mammals|publisher=Salmonier Nature Park, Department of the Environment, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2008-06-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080327200755/http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/snp/Education/LandMammals.htm |archivedate = March 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  large herds of [[reindeer|Woodland caribou]] can be found in the barren interior regions of the island. Two animals formerly resident in Newfoundland have been declared [[extinct]]: the [[Great auk]], a flightless seabird, and the [[Newfoundland wolf]], a subspecies of the [[Gray wolf]]. The [[Labrador duck]], believed to have nested in Labrador, was one of the first North American bird species to be recorded as becoming extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/conservation/extinctions/labrador_duck|title=Labrador Duck: the Mystery Extinction|publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithilogy|accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many rare herbaceous plants and insects occur on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;/&gt; The west coast of the island supports over 200 plant species. Rare species such as Long’s braya (''[[Braya longii]]'') and Fernald’s braya (''B. fernaldii''), are [[Endemism|endemic]] to Newfoundland.&lt;ref name=&quot;bry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/search/advSearchResults_e.cfm?stype=species&amp;lng=e&amp;advkeywords=&amp;op=1&amp;locid=7&amp;taxid=12&amp;desid=0&amp;schid=0&amp;|title=Species at Risk Public Registry|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Braya]]s are small perennial herbs of the [[brassicaceae]] family. They are only found on a narrow strip of land extending approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|sp=us}} on the extreme western portion of the [[Great Northern Peninsula]], a limestones barrens habitat. The braya population is low due to habitat loss from gravel quarrying. Researchers have only found three populations of Long's braya,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=6|title=Species at risk: Long's braya|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 or 15 populations of Fernald's brayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=5|title=Species at risk: Fernald's braya|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have focused on how various types of disturbances affect the long-term viability of these populations. The Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, with many partners, is studying the rare plant flora of the island of Newfoundland and in 2002 announced a recovery plan for the braya species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/2002/tcr/1009n05.htm |title= National Recovery Plan for Long’s Braya and Fernald’s Braya|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador press release|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many plants and animals have been introduced to Newfoundland, either by chance or deliberately.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;&gt;http://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/2002/tcr/1009n05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moose]], [[snowshoe hare]], [[American red squirrel]], [[eastern chipmunk]], and [[shrew|masked shrew]], and others, were brought to the island through specific wildlife mandates. Moose were introduced in 1904 and are now the dominant [[ungulate]] on the island. An unusual experiment conducted in 1964 involved relocating a small herd of [[bison]] onto [[Brunette Island]] in [[Fortune Bay]]. The last of these animals is thought to have died by 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The marine waters around the province are considered boreal, or sub-Arctic, in nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;/&gt;  A great deal of the coastline is rock-strewn, allowing an extensive variety of plant and animal life to thrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;/&gt; The leading plants of the shoreline are the large brown [[seaweeds]], such as bladder, forked and knotted [[Wrack (seaweed)|Wracks]], and winged and sugar [[kelp]]s, though there are also a number of red and green seaweeds present. Common animals of the seashore region include [[barnacle]]s,  [[Limpet|tortoiseshell limpet]], [[common periwinkle]], [[Mussel|blue mussels]], [[sea anemones]], [[Opisthobranchia|sea slugs]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[starfish]], and rock [[crabs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;/&gt; The deeper waters are home to a variety of fish, such as [[cod|Atlantic cod]], [[sculpins]] and [[bergall|cunners]], [[halibut]], [[haddock]], [[shark]]s, and marine mammals, such as [[dolphins]], [[porpoises]], and [[whales]]. Whales seen off Newfoundland include [[Pilot whales]], [[minke]]s, [[sei whale]]s, [[fin whale]]s and [[humpback whale|humpbacks]]. [[harp seal|Harp]] and [[hooded seal]]s are usually found in the spring, giving birth to their young on coastal ice floes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:polar-bear.jpg|right|thumb|The [[polar bear]] (''Ursus maritimus'') is the dominant carnivore in the tundra]]
The tundra is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.&lt;ref name=&quot;tre&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ses&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/seasonal.html|title=Climate Characteristics |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is low. Soil a meter below ground and deeper is permanently frozen ([[permafrost]]), which does not allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low [[shrubs]], [[lichens]], [[mosses]], and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the tundra are the [[barren-ground caribou]], [[Arctic wolf]], [[Arctic fox]], [[Arctic hare]], [[lemming]]s, and [[vole]]s. Occasional sightings of [[muskox]]en have been made near [[Cape Chidley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordplay.com/tourism/self_guided_tours/mammals/|title=Mammals of Newfoundland and Labrador|first=David A.|last=Snow|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Tourism, Culture, &amp; Recreation|accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labrador's most northerly point. The [[polar bear]] is the dominant carnivore of the tundra, but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the [[common eider]], [[harlequin duck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txwaterfowler.com/html_pages/ducks/harlequin/harlequin.htm|title=Harlequin Duck (''Histrionicus histrionicus'')|

Southern Labrador is mostly taiga. It is characterized by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;/&gt; The taiga is dominated by [[coniferous]] trees, notably [[balsam fir]] and [[black spruce]], though the deciduous [[white birch]], [[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] and [[Sorbus|mountain ash]] are also present.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;/&gt; The most common animals are the [[moose]], [[American black bear]], [[Canada lynx]], [[red fox]], [[pine marten]], [[short-tailed weasel]], and [[Mink|American mink]]. [[Beaver]]s, [[muskrat]]s, and [[North American river otter|river otter]]s thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecs&quot;/&gt; [[Willow ptarmigan]], [[common raven]], and [[blackpoll warbler]] inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while [[golden eagle]]s, [[rough-legged hawk]]s and [[peregrine falcon]]s nest on steep cliffs.&lt;ref name=birds/&gt;

== Climate ==
The province has been divided into seven climate types,&lt;ref name=&quot;ses&quot;/&gt; but in broader terms Newfoundland is considered to be a cool summer subtype of a [[humid continental climate]], which is greatly influenced by the sea since no part of the island is more than {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} from the ocean. Northern Labrador is classified as a [[Polar region|polar]] [[tundra]] climate, southern Labrador is considered to have a [[subarctic climate]].

Monthly average temperatures, rainfall and snowfall for four communities are shown in the attached graphs. [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] represents the east coast, [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]] the interior of the island, [[Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador|Corner Brook]] the west coast of the island and [[Wabush, Newfoundland and Labrador|Wabush]] the interior of Labrador. The detailed information and information for 73 communities in the province is available from a government website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/stnselect_e.html|title=Environment Canada Climate data for Newfoundland and Labrador|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data used in making the graphs is the average taken over thirty years. Error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime highs and night time lows. Snowfall is the total amount which fell during the month, not the amount accumulated on the ground. This distinction is particularly important for St. John's where a heavy snowfall can be followed by rain so that no snow remains on the ground.
[[Image:Newfoundland and Labrador temperatures chart.png|right|thumb|Newfoundland and Labrador average monthly temperatures'']]
[[Image:Newfoundland and Labrador rainfall chart.png|right|thumb|Newfoundland and Labrador average monthly rainfall]]
[[Image:Newfoundland and Labrador snowfall chart.png|right|thumb|Newfoundland and Labrador average monthly snowfall'']]

Surface water temperatures on the Atlantic side reaches a summer average of {{convert|12|°C|°F|abbr=on}} inshore and {{convert|9|°C|°F|abbr=on}} offshore to winter lows of {{convert|-1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} inshore and {{convert|2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} offshore. Sea temperatures on the west coast are warmer than Atlantic side by 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;°C (approximately 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;°F). The sea keeps winter temperatures slightly higher and summer temperatures a little lower on the coast than at places inland. The maritime climate produces more variable weather, ample precipitation in a variety of forms, greater [[humidity]], lower visibility, more clouds, less sunshine, and higher winds than a continental climate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt; Some of these effects can be seen in the graphs. Labrador's climate differs from that of the island not only because it is further north, but also because the interior does not see the moderating effects of the ocean.

Weather systems affecting Newfoundland usually originate from the west, over mainland Canada, or from the southwest, from the east coast of the United States. [[cyclone|Cyclonic storms]] consist of an area of [[low pressure area|low atmospheric pressure]] characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate [[counter clockwise]] in the [[northern hemisphere]]. Such storms passing to the south of the island bring strong northeasterly winds sweeping in off the open [[North Atlantic Ocean]]. These storms are sometimes referred to as [[Nor'easter]]s and are responsible for the worst of Newfoundland's weather. High winds [[Fetch (geography)|sweeping over a large surface]] of ocean can build up very large waves. The frequency and severity of storms is greatest between November and March, although they may occur at any time of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt;

One of these storms was the &quot;Independence Hurricane&quot;, which struck eastern Newfoundland on September 9, 1775. About 4000 sailors, mostly from the British Isles, were reported to have been drowned.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt;

During a violent storm on February 15, 1982, the drilling rig [[Ocean Ranger]] capsized and sank on the Grand Banks, {{convert|300|km|mi|sp=us}} east of St. John's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/gm/moa/boards/oceanranger.pdf |title=Marine Casualty Report for the Ocean Ranger (pdf)|publisher=United States Coast Guard| accessdate=2008-06-17}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The entire 84-man crew perished, making it the worst Canadian marine disaster in decades.

Newfoundland and Labrador has the strongest winds of any of the provinces, with most places having average annual wind speeds over 20&amp;nbsp;kilometers per hour (12&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt;

Freezing rain is common in Newfoundland where it is known as &quot;silver thaw&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt; Freezing drizzle or freezing rain occurs on average of 150 hours each winter, most commonly in March. One such storm struck St. John's on April 11, 1984 and lasted three days. Ice almost 15&amp;nbsp;centimeters (5.9&amp;nbsp;in) thick disrupted electrical power to 200,000 people on the Avalon Peninsula for days.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt;

Newfoundland receives less than 1600 hours of sunshine per year, much lower than the Canadian average of 1925 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt; Summer months average 187 hours of sun while the December average is 60 hours.

Newfoundland is also known for its fog which occurs most often in the spring and early summer because of the contrast between sea and air temperatures. [[Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Argentia]] has 206 days of fog per year. Fog in Newfoundland is frequently accompanied by strong onshore winds; while usually winds disperse fog, here the fog is too widespread for this to occur.

=== St. John's weather extremes ===
Of all the major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest (124 days, next to [[City of Halifax|Halifax's]] 122), snowiest (359&amp;nbsp;centimeters (141&amp;nbsp;in), next to [[Quebec City]]'s 343&amp;nbsp;centimeters (135&amp;nbsp;in)), wettest (1514&amp;nbsp;millimeters (59.6&amp;nbsp;in), next to Halifax's 1491 millimeters (58.7&amp;nbsp;in)), windiest ({{convert|24.3|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} average speed, next to [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina's]] {{convert|20.7|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}), and cloudiest (1,497&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine, next to [[Charlottetown]]'s 1,818&amp;nbsp;hours).&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlantic-web1.ns.ec.gc.ca/climatecentre/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=83846147-1|title=The Climate of Newfoundland|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2008-06-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080619101034/http://atlantic-web1.ns.ec.gc.ca/climatecentre/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=83846147-1 |archivedate = June 19, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. John's has one of the mildest winters in Canada (third mildest city next to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[Vancouver]]), yet has the most freezing rain days of any major Canadian city.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt;

== Hydrography ==

=== Fresh water ===

Shallow [[soil]] and [[bedrock]] deeply scored by [[glaciers]] are responsible for the numerous [[lake]]s and ponds, and short, swift flowing [[rivers]] scattered across Newfoundland and Labrador. The area of freshwater in Newfoundland and Labrador is {{convert|31,340|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, covering 7.7% of the total surface of area of the province and accounting for 3.5% of the freshwater area of Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas area&quot;/&gt;

{{See also|Category:Lakes of Newfoundland and Labrador|Category:Rivers of Newfoundland and Labrador}}

=== Ocean ===
The west coast of Newfoundland borders on the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] while all other coasts face the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Labrador's coast borders the [[Labrador Sea]], a part of the Atlantic Ocean. The [[Strait of Belle Isle]] connects the Gulf of St. Lawrence with the Labrador Sea and is the narrowest channel separating Newfoundland from mainland Canada. The [[Cabot Strait]] separates Newfoundland from [[Cape Breton Island]], [[Nova Scotia]].

The [[continental shelf]] off Newfoundland is known as the [[Grand Banks]]. The cold [[Labrador Current]] and the warm [[Gulf Stream]] meet on the Grand Banks, making the area not only one of the richest fishing grounds in the world, but also one of the foggiest areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt; The Grand Banks are an area of significant [[petroleum]] production with [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia]], [[White Rose (oil field)|White Rose]] and [[Terra Nova (oil field)|Terra Nova]] [[oil fields]] all located there.
[[Image:Grand Banks.png|right|thumb]]

=== Icebergs and pack ice ===
Approximately 90% of [[icebergs]] in the North Atlantic come from about 100 iceberg-producing [[glaciers]] on the [[Greenland]] coast. Once detached from the glaciers, icebergs are transported southward through the [[Davis Strait]] by the Labrador Current.&lt;ref name=&quot;ice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordplay.com/tourism/icebergs|title=Icebergs of Newfoundland and Labrador FAQ|last=Bruneau |first=Stephen E. |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 40,000 medium to large icebergs annually [[Ice calving|calve]] from Greenland glaciers, and depending on wind, and air and water temperature, between 400 and 800 of these go as far south as 48° north latitude (St. John's).&lt;ref name=&quot;ice&quot;/&gt; Icebergs are most commonly seen in the waters off Newfoundland in the spring and early summer.
Despite their size, the icebergs of Newfoundland move an average of {{convert|17|km|mi|sp=us}} a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;ice&quot;/&gt; The average mass of icebergs in the Grand Banks area is between one and two hundred thousand tonnes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ice&quot;/&gt; These icebergs represent a significant threat to [[shipping]] and off-shore [[oil platforms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mar.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/ocean/seaice/Posters/Iceberg_Nov2003.pdf|title=Forecasting of the Iceberg Population on the Grand Banks (pdf)|last=Peterson|first=Ingrid|publisher=Ocean Sciences Division, Bedford Institute of Oceanography|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the hazard is aggravated by dense fog in this area.

During the first half of each year the waters off Newfoundland may become covered with floes of [[sea ice]] or &quot;pack ice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghi&quot;/&gt; While icebergs are composed of fresh water, pack ice is frozen sea water. The severity of ice varies considerably, depending on the strength and direction of the wind and air temperature. Most of the pack ice off Newfoundland's northern and eastern shores originates off Labrador. While some of the pack ice off the west coast also comes from the sea off Labrador via the Strait of Belle Isle, most of it originates in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Beginning in January the pack ice begins to advance south, borne by the Labrador Current until (usually) in April the rate of melting overtakes the rate of advance and the ice retreats northward. The leading edge of the pack ice is known as &quot;The Front&quot; and is important to the annual [[Seal hunting|seal hunt]] off Newfoundland's north coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/seal-phoque/faq_e.htm|title=Seals and Sealing in Canada:FAQ|publisher= Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=2008-06-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080609053914/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/seal-phoque/faq_e.htm |archivedate = June 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time zones ==
Newfoundland is located in a unique [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone|time zone]] in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;cde&quot;/&gt; It is a half an hour ahead of Atlantic Time, one and a half hours ahead of Central Canada and 4 ½ hours ahead of the west coast of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cde&quot;/&gt; Labrador operates on Atlantic Time, except for the coast between [[L'Anse au Clair]] and [[Norman's Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Norman's Bay]], which is on Newfoundland time.&lt;ref name=&quot;cde&quot;/&gt;

== Natural resources ==
''All currency is in Canadian dollars.''

Exploitation of natural resources is a major part of the [[economic geography]] of Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2005 the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of Newfoundland and Labrador was approximately fourteen billion dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;econ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economics.gov.nl.ca/E2007/default.asp|title=Economic Research and Analysis 2007|publisher= Economics and Statistics Branch, Department of Finance, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, Office of the Queens Printer|accessdate= 2008-06-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070624045306/http://www.economics.gov.nl.ca/E2007/default.asp |archivedate = June 24, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|Service industries]] accounted for over $8&amp;nbsp;billion and resource-based activities such as [[mining]], [[extraction of petroleum|oil production]], [[fishery]] and forest-based industries ([[sawmill]]s and [[paper mills]]) accounted for the remainder.

=== Minerals and petroleum ===
Mines in Labrador, the [[iron ore]] mine at [[Wabush]]/[[Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador|Labrador City]], and the new [[nickel]] mine in [[Voisey's Bay]] produced a total of $2.5 billion worth of ore in 2006. A new mine at Duck Pond (30 kilometers (18&amp;nbsp;mi) south of the now-closed mine at [[Buchans, Newfoundland and Labrador|Buchans]]), started producing [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[silver]] and [[gold]] in 2007 and prospecting for new ore bodies continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usetdas.com/TDAS/NewsArticle.aspx?NewsID=8859|title=Buchans mine|publisher=Filing Services Canada Inc|accessdate=2006-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mining accounted for 3.5% of the provincial GDP in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;econ&quot;/&gt; The province produces 55% of Canada’s total iron ore.&lt;ref name=&quot;cef&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/mineral.html|title=Mineral Resources|last=Bell|first=Trevor|author2=Liverman, David |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quarry|Quarries]] producing [[dimension stone]] such as [[slate]] and [[granite]], account for less than $10&amp;nbsp;million worth of material per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/mines&amp;en/geosurvey/dimension/dimension.stm|title=Geological survey: Dimension stone in Newfoundland and Labrador|publisher=Natural Resources, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[extraction of petroleum|Oil production]] from offshore [[oil platforms]] on [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia]], [[White Rose (oil field)|White Rose]] and [[Terra Nova (oil field)|Terra Nova]] [[oil fields]] on the [[Grand Banks]] was {{convert|110|Moilbbl|m3}} which contributed 15% of the provinces GDP in 2006. Total production from the Hibernia field from 1997 to 2006 was {{convert|733|Moilbbl|m3}} with an estimated value of $36&amp;nbsp;billion. Remaining reserves are estimated at almost {{convert|2|Goilbbl|m3}} as of December 31, 2006. Exploration for new reserves is ongoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;econ&quot;/&gt;

=== Fishing and aquaculture ===
The [[fishing]] industry remains an important part of the provincial economy, employing 26,000 and contributing over $440 million to the GDP. The combined harvest of fish such as [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[halibut]], [[herring]] and [[mackerel]] was 150,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes (165,000&amp;nbsp;tons) valued at about $130&amp;nbsp;million in 2006. [[Shellfish]], such as [[crab]], [[shrimp]] and [[clams]], accounted for 195,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes (215,000&amp;nbsp;tons) with a value of $316&amp;nbsp;million in the same year. The value of products from the [[Seal hunting|seal hunt]] was $55&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;econ&quot;/&gt;

[[Aquaculture]] is a new industry for the province, which in 2006 produced over 10,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes of [[Atlantic Salmon]], [[mussels]] and [[Rainbow trout|Steelhead Trout]] worth over $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;econ&quot;/&gt;

=== Forestry ===
[[Newsprint]] is produced by the [[paper mill]] in [[Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador|Corner Brook]], (capacity of 420,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes (462,000&amp;nbsp;tons) per year). Until March 31, 2009  there was a second papermill located in [[Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador|Grand Falls]], but due to the [[Late-2000s recession|2008/2009 economic crisis]] the mill shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.gov.nl.ca/E2003/forestry.asp|title=The Economy 2003 - Newfoundland and Labrador Forestry and Agrifoods|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2008-06-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050308214816/http://www.economics.gov.nl.ca/E2003/forestry.asp |archivedate = March 8, 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of newsprint exports varies greatly from year to year, depending on the global market price. Lumber is produced by numerous mills in Newfoundland.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture in Newfoundland in limited to areas south of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], near [[Deer Lake, Newfoundland and Labrador|Deer Lake]] and in the [[Codroy Valley]]. Elsewhere the soil is mostly unsuitable for farming. [[Potatoes]], [[rutabaga]]s, known locally as &quot;[[turnips]]&quot;, [[carrots]] and [[cabbage]] are grown for local consumption. Wild [[blueberries]], [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|partridge berries]] and [[Cloudberry|bakeapples]] are harvested commercially and used in [[fruit preserves|jams]] and [[wine]] making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rodrigueswinery.com/ | title=Rodriques Winery | publisher=Rodrigues Winery|accessdate=2007-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human geography ==
Newfoundland and Labrador had a population of 505,469 (2005 estimate) and a [[population density]] of 1.27 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3.1 per sq mi). The provincial capital is [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], which had a population of 181,113 in 2005). St John's is located at the extreme eastern edge of the island on the [[Avalon Peninsula]]. The other cities are [[Mount Pearl, Newfoundland and Labrador|Mount Pearl]] and [[Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador|Corner Brook]].

{{See also|List of communities in Newfoundland and Labrador}}

Human inhabitation in Newfoundland and Labrador can be traced back over 9,000 years to the people of the Maritime Archaic Tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therooms.ca/museum/mnotes12.asp|title=Museum Notes - The Maritime Archaic Tradition|last= Tuck|first=James A. |publisher=&quot;The Rooms&quot; Provincial museum |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were gradually displaced by people of the [[Dorset Culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therooms.ca/museum/mnotes5.asp
|title=Museum Notes - Palaeoeskimo in Newfoundland &amp; Labrador|last=Renouf |first=M.A.P.  |publisher=&quot;The Rooms&quot; Provincial museum |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally by the [[Innu]] and [[Inuit]] in Labrador and the [[Beothuks]] on the island. The oldest known European contact was made over a thousand years ago when the [[Vikings]] briefly settled in [[L'Anse aux Meadows]]. Five hundred years later, European explorers  ([[John Cabot]], [[Gaspar Corte-Real]], [[Jacques Cartier]] and others), fishermen from England, [[Portugal]], France and Spain and [[Basque people|Basque]] [[Whaling|whalers]] (the remains of several whaling stations have been found at [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador]]) began exploration and exploitation of the area.

Early European (primarily from England, Ireland and France) settlement in Newfoundland was confined to the coast. The rich [[cod]] fishery on the [[Grand Banks]] and along the shore of the island was the primary reason for these settlements. The rugged shoreline provided many small, but isolated, harbors ([[Newfoundland outport|outports]]) from which to conduct the fishery. The [[Avalon Peninsula]] was, and is, the most populous part of the island, and as such had the best developed system of early roads and trails. Transportation between communities on other parts of the coast, especially the south coast between [[Fortune Bay]] and [[Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port aux Basques]], was exclusively by boat. Almost all communities are now accessible by roads which are part of the [[List of Newfoundland and Labrador highways|provincial road system]]. The now-defunct [[Newfoundland Railway]], built in the latter part of the 19th century, and the development of the [[lead]], [[zinc]] and [[copper]] mine at [[Buchans, Newfoundland and Labrador|Buchans]] and the [[paper mill]] in [[Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador|Grand Falls]] in the early 20th century marked the beginning of the settlement of the interior of the island. Despite these developments the majority of the population is still found along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.durham.net/~kburt/NewfoundlandHistory.html|title=Population distribution|publisher=Newfoundland Outport|accessdate=2007-10-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071103104751/http://www.durham.net/~kburt/NewfoundlandHistory.html |archivedate = November 3, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlement of [[Labrador]] followed a similar pattern, with the interior being settled only in the latter part of the 20th century with the development of the [[iron ore]] mines at [[Wabush]], [[hydroelectric]] generation at [[Churchill Falls]] and the military base at [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Goose Bay]].

[[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] peoples include the [[Innu]], [[Inuit]] and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] of [[Labrador]] and the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] in Newfoundland. One aboriginal group, the [[Beothuks]] became extinct in the early 19th century.
