== Color(s?) ==

I was under the impression that only orange was an official color - blue is an unofficial secondary color.  Why are both listed? - [[User:Plasticbadge|Plasticbadge]] 23:49, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

As is usually the case with the waste of bandwidth known as wikipedia, they have it WRONG. Orange is the ONLY &quot;official color&quot;, and the original &quot;Orangeman&quot; name WAS from the Irish Proddy fraternity, NOT the color Orange. I do not correct Wipikipedia erros, in the hopes that the failed experiment in empowering ignorant angry loners with faux influnence, will implode into it's own stupidity.

== Dwight Freeney ==

Hope nobody minds but I added him to the players list last week.  I can't believe he wasn't on there to begin with and I thought he should definitely be added on there with his accomplishments.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/141.238.98.77|141.238.98.77]] ([[User talk:141.238.98.77|talk]]) 04:01, 18 September 2008 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Dave Meggyesy==
I added a link to the [[Dave Meggyesy]] article that I just started.  I can find lots about his book and the related controversy, but almost nothing about his college and NFL careers.  The pro football databases do not have defensive statistics for the 1960s, except for the number of games played. There are a couple of Google News hits that say he was an All-American at Syracuse, but I'd have to pay for an article in order to see the details--such as whose list he was on.  If anybody has access to sources of Meggyesy's performance at St. Louis or at Syracuse, please add it to the infobox or start a new section. The article still seems stubbish for NFL and college football projects.--[[User:Hjal|Hjal]] ([[User talk:Hjal|talk]]) 05:14, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

==Split football section into own article?==
Most other major universities with a football team have separate articles for their team. Should the football history section be split into its own article? [[User:Cardsplayer4life|Cardsplayer4life]] ([[User talk:Cardsplayer4life|talk]]) 06:20, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
:Sure. I split the basketball team into it's own page. I've been waiting for someone to do the same with football... Good luck. [[User:GoCuse44|GoCuse44]] ([[User talk:GoCuse44|talk]]) 17:09, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

::Indeed, it should be - almost all BCS Conference schools have their football teams with their own article.  The only exceptions are Syracuse, Cincinnati, and Connecticut.  This ought to be rectified. [[User:John Kenney|john k]] ([[User talk:John Kenney|talk]]) 15:05, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

:::::I split it off into its own article at [[Syracuse Orange football]]. Not being very familiar with the university, I did the best that I could, but it needs quite a lot of work to make it better. (lots more info could be filled in on the infobox to start) Hopefully it is an alright rough place to start from for you guys. The addition of a section on rivalries (if there are any for Syracuse), coaching history (maybe a chart or something of all the coaches), more information on football-related facilities, and information on any awards and highlights of the team (All American awards, coaching awards, bowl appearances, Heismans, etc.) might be good things to think about adding. Also, I was wondering if it would be good to add the football team to the [[Template:Syracuse University|Syracuse University navigational template]]? (along with the basketball article) [[User:Cardsplayer4life|Cardsplayer4life]] ([[User talk:Cardsplayer4life|talk]]) 02:40, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

== Just sport? ==

Any user notice that more than nine-tenths of this article is dedicated to athletics?  There is very little academic content about Syracuse University on this Wiki article. [[User:Snowfalcon cu|Snowfalcon cu]] ([[User talk:Snowfalcon cu|talk]]) 20:51, 19 November 2013 (UTC)

That's because this is about the athletic program at this school, not about the school I general. [[User:Wschart|Wschart]] ([[User talk:Wschart|talk]]) 16:38, 16 March 2014 (UTC)
