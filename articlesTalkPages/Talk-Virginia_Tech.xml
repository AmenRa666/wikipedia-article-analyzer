==Image choice==
Please compare these two images:
[[Image:VirginiaTechCampusBridge.jpg|thumb|left]]
[[Image:Virginiatech-bridge-over-mall.JPG|thumb|left]]
I contend that the bottom one is brighter, has a better view of the VT logo, shows the Hokie stone better, focuses more on the subject of the building than the foreground of the pavement, and in general is a better choice for this article.[[User:HokieRNB|HokieRNB]] ([[User talk:HokieRNB|talk]]) 16:13, 11 March 2008 (UTC)

I would agree with the fact that it shows the hokie stone better but it looks washed out and unprofessional. I have cropped the other image so that it shows the hokie stone better and focuses more on the bridge. I also have added a better lit picture that I have that I think is more professional looking. Let me know what you think: [[Image:TorgBridgeVirginiaTech.jpg|thumb|left|cropped version]] [[Image:VirginiaTechBridge.jpg|thumb|left|alternative, brighter version]]

Don't take this the wrong way, but they all look crooked. I'd use the &quot;level&quot; tool in Photoshop or Gimp to crop them correctly. ([[User:Possum4all|Possum4all]] ([[User talk:Possum4all|talk]]) 06:03, 25 November 2009 (UTC))

==Academics==
Great job whoever just expanded the academics section. It's just what we needed. [[User:Chuy1530|Chuy1530]] ([[User talk:Chuy1530|talk]]) 13:47, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

==Art's Initiative==

Would the art initiatives bit that was recently reverted due to being a blatant copy and paste be worthy of being in the article if it were rewritten? I'd be willing to rewrite it so that it isn't a copyright issue but only if it's deemed appropriate for the article.

== Proposal: references should read &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; ==

I move that in other wiki pages that reference this page the link should read &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; not &quot;Virginia Polytechnic Institute&quot;.  &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; is one of the university's official names and is by far the most common name.  It's even on the letterhead.  [[User:SnappingTurtle|SnappingTurtle]] ([[User talk:SnappingTurtle|talk]]) 22:37, 22 August 2008 (UTC)

== Weight of 2007 massacre ==

Please understand that I don't mean to be obsessed with tragic events here, but I do think that mentioning the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] only as a 'see also' in this page is probably downplaying its significance too much. Especially given that readers unfamiliar with the subject will take some time to recognise that 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University' is in fact the same institution commonly referred to as 'Virginia Tech', the lack of any mention in the text may leave people unsure whether they are on the right page. Would it not be worth adding a one sentence mention in the 'History' section with a quick link? Something like &quot;On 16 April 2007, 32 students and members of staff were [[Virginia Tech massacre|shot dead]] and many others wounded by a student in the deadliest shooting incident by a single gunman in United States history.&quot; (or possibly shorter) [[User:Sam Blacketer|Sam Blacketer]] ([[User talk:Sam Blacketer|talk]]) 11:38, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

:: I fully agree. It is obviously (however unsavoury it may be) something that is tied with the university. It does need to be referenced in the intro and more directly in the history summary. This has precedent as evidenced by the [[Columbine High School]] page. It can't simply not be mentioned beyond the reference link. No one intends to be hurtful, but Wikpeadia shouldn't censor itself for the sake of political correctness. If no one has any better suggestions I will do so later. [[User:Syferus|Syferus]] ([[User talk:Syferus|talk]]) 11:47, 16 October 2008 (UTC)

:::It used to have a subsection under History that directed readers to the main article, but it seems that an IP editor removed it [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=228232889 diff].  I will add it back.

::::I absolutely agree the shootings do not have enough weight. Listing the massacre as the final &quot;See Also&quot; is burying it way too much. I think it needs to be a couple sentences in the history summary, with a link, at the very least. [[User:Otto1970|Otto1970]] ([[User talk:Otto1970|talk]]) 22:50, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

I came here looking for the massacre, I must admit, I doubted for a second if it was a different V-tech, since the word death isn't even mentioned in the article. I think it's cool that some people can baw so much, that the rational people just censor the whole thing to shut them up for good. But I also think it would be smart to start discussing how many shootings/deaths are necessary for them to make it into this page. Kind of, since all this is bound to happen again, why not set right here right now, how many shootings have to take place before they are acknowledged?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/190.50.217.212|190.50.217.212]] ([[User talk:190.50.217.212|talk]]) 09:13, 5 August 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:It's right there in the article:  &quot;In 2007, the school and campus received international attention as the site of the Virginia Tech massacre, which was the deadliest peacetime shooting incident by a single gunman in United States history, on or off of a school campus.&quot; [[User talk:HokieRNB|Hokie]][[User:HokieRNB|RNB]] 01:10, 12 August 2011 (UTC)

== A new bizarre episode involving violent death -- include or not? ==

When I saw [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=265641250 this anonymous edit], I assumed it was typical bullshit vandalism.  Indeed, another anon editor removed it almost immediately as an &quot;inaccuracy.&quot;  Just to make sure all my ducks were in a row before leaving the first anon a {{tl|uw-error1}}, I checked the ''Collegiate Times'', and to my surprise found that it seems the first IP editor [http://www.collegiatetimes.com/stories/2009/01/21/stabbing_death_in_donaldson_brown was substantially correct].&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, other editors in the grip of [[WP:RECENTISM]] will want to add this incident to the article, perhaps, as the first person to attempt the addition did, link it implicitly with the Cho incident.  There are a lot of good reasons this new murder should '''not''' be included in the article for the time being and should not be added in the future unless it ends up having some sort of earth-shattering, direction-changing impact on the institution itself.  For a precedent, and a detailed discussion of the aforementioned good reasons to leave this kind of thing out, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:St._Mark's_College_(University_of_Adelaide)/RfC:_Should_a_murder_be_included_in_a_college's_article&amp;oldid=182482054 Talk:St. Mark's College (University of Adelaide)/RfC: Should a murder be included in a college's article] (link to last revision before page was courtesy-blanked).

I don't see that it's necessary. Why is it relevant at all on this page? His bio would be the best place, right? Would the top-most Army page get updated? I think not. Why this page? ([[User:Possum4all|Possum4all]] ([[User talk:Possum4all|talk]]) 06:00, 25 November 2009 (UTC))

== Research Computing ==

I'm not really sure how the editing goes, but while doing some work for my resume I found some more information on the newest super computer from the CHECS(Center for High End Computing) site.

== Merge discussion ==

*'''Propose''' that [[Virginia Tech Hampton Roads Center]] be merged here. The material would usefull expand the section here on that center, but it's not enough for an article of its own, at the moment anyway. [[User:Itsmejudith|Itsmejudith]] ([[User talk:Itsmejudith|talk]]) 21:39, 18 February 2009 (UTC)

*'''Support''' - There's not really a much information written about it.  A quick searcg via google shows it being mentioned, but no substantial writeups that would indicate a separate article would be justified. -- [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 22:41, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

==Major Major Nidal Malik Hasan==

The article has nothing about the fact that the [[Major Nidal Malik Hasan]] studied in this instituition.[[User:Agre22|Agre22]] ([[User talk:Agre22|talk]]) 02:40, 8 November 2009 (UTC)agre22

Why is this relevant to the institution's wikipedia page? It can simply be reflected in his bio. It's not relevant with respect to the institutional history and academic mission. Nor does it have a place on the page and doesn't deserve it's own callout. ([[User:Possum4all|Possum4all]] ([[User talk:Possum4all|talk]]) 05:52, 25 November 2009 (UTC))

:I concur, but I think it would be appropriate to include it in an expansion of the &quot;alumni&quot; section.

I'm somewhat surprised that this article makes no mention of the university's &quot;Math Emporium&quot;.  It's been open since 1997, and is part of nearly every undergraduate's experience there.

===section on recent violence at Tech?===
I dont know where/how it would fit on their wiki page, but should something be put in the article about all of the recent violence directly or indirectly involving tech?  It would include the [[Virginia Tech Massacre]], the actions of [[William Morva]] in 2006, the shootings today (Dec 8, 2011), the [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/27/virginia-tech-students-fo_n_270892.html VT students executed in Jefferson Forest], [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,481406,00.html the VT Student stabbed to death and decapitated on campus], and that the shooter from the [[Fort Hood shooting]] was an alum.

During the traffic stop. the officer was shot and killed. There were witnesses to this shooting. Witnesses reported to police the shooter fled on foot heading toward the Cage, a parking lot near Duck Pond Drive. At that parking lot, a second person was found. That person is also deceased.

Saying that there is &quot;a lot of violence&quot; is not supported by Clery act data. Virginia Tech isn't even the highest in the Commonwealth regarding reported violence.

== Call for discussion/consensus on adding shooting incidents to this page ==

There seems to be quite a few edit adding and removing the 2007 and 2011 shooting incidents.  I recommend that we come to a consensus on whether or not the incidents should be reference. In so much as the University of Texas, Kent State, Columbine High School and others that have had major incidents have a reference to the incident on that schools wiki page as well as a separate, more in depth page for the incident. Since wiki is a place to look for information, I feel that both VT incidents should be included/summarized on the main page and then expanded on a separate page.  To not include them seems to violate the NPOV ideal.  Thanks, chris  [[User:W4chris|W4chris]] ([[User talk:W4chris|talk]]) 16:16, 9 December 2011 (UTC)

{{outdent}}  The 2007 incident has been mentioned in this article and wikilinked to the dedicated [[Virginia Tech massacre]] article which covers the subject extensively.  That has served the Virginia Tech article well for years and last week's incident didn't create a need for more explanation of the 2007 incident.  The current wording is excellent.  If you look back over the article's history you'll find that the sentence was worded carefully (e.g. &quot;the site of&quot;)  to keep to the focus on the subject of this article, the university.  Expanding this information into a paragraph or especially into its own section  is unnecessary and takes the focus this well written article has.  If there were no dedicated article on the subject I'd be all for expanding information here, but there is a dedicated article and no need to duplicate so many details here.  Readers need to know that this happened but this article is about the university, not the 2007 incident, let's not take the focus away.--[[User:RadioFan|RadioFan]] ([[User talk:RadioFan|talk]]) 12:57, 11 December 2011 (UTC)

==Obvious Bias==
This article has been quite clearly doctored in order to remove reference to the 2007 Seung-Hui Cho shooting, arguably (and somewhat unfortunately) the most notable aspect of the entire university. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a result of university PR, but a single sentence at the bottom of the History section and a link to the main article hidden at the bottom is quite simply an embarrassment. It at the very least deserves its own subsection (with a subheading link to the main article), as well as some impartial editors, rather than the VT affiliates currently policing the article and reverting changes under bogus citations of notability and quality.

{{unindent}}I'll try to explain the close in a bit more detail. First off, as was noted in the discussion, the relevant section at [[WP:AT]] says &quot;Wikipedia does not necessarily use the subject's 'official' name as an article title; it prefers to use the name that is most frequently used to refer to the subject in English-language [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].&quot; Additionally, as was also indicated, the college-specific guideline [[WP:UNIGUIDE]] says, &quot;Colleges and universities should '''always''' be named using the '''common (not necessarily official) name''' of the institution&quot; (emphasis mine). In this case, by all evidence, &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; is overwhelmingly the most common way of referring to the university in the sources, and no one appears to dispute that. There are other examples of college articles that use a non-official name when something else is overwhelmingly more common, such [[Ohio State University]], [[Florida A&amp;M University]], and [[Rutgers University]]. As such, the move was supported by policy, practice, and the local consensus in the discussion.&lt;br&gt;
I'm sympathetic to the wish there had been more input, but there's no set amount of input an RM needs, and the fact is this had drawn almost no new comments for two and a half weeks. Especially considering the strength of the evidence, I stand by my reading of the consensus.&lt;br&gt;
As for the potential of this to affect other moves, I don't see that as an adequate reason to avoid an otherwise convincing move. As an aside, I really don't see it happening, anyway. I tend to doubt that, for instance, West Virginia University is really overwhelmingly better known as &quot;WVU&quot;, and in many such cases the nicknames will fail other key [[WP:NAMINGCRITERIA|naming criteria]].--[[User:Cuchullain|CÃºchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 20:04, 20 November 2012 (UTC)
:I'd suggest that Wikipedia could use a consensus-driven policy on the naming of colleges and universities. Until now, the naming has been derived from some version of the &quot;official&quot; name, and ''not'' &quot;Virginia Tech,&quot; &quot;Penn State,&quot; &quot;Ohio State,&quot;UMass,&quot; etc.  The major exception, as pointed out above, is Rutgers, which is far preferable to its official title. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University could be argued to be a similar mouthful, but I would suggest that ample precedent exists with respect to all of the Techs, States, and A&amp;Ms, of which Virginia Tech is now an outlier in the naming convention field. Rather than argue it at RM, which to me is a place to argue procedure (though I stand by the assertion that too few opinions have been solicited: we routinely relist AfDs to get broader consensus, for instance)., I would prefer that it be discussed here or as an RfC. I don't see &quot;local consensus&quot; as sufficient to overturn a ''de facto'' convention for the States and Techs without ''much'' more input from the community.
:A bit of history: when I was looking at colleges in the mid-1970s, Virginia Tech was called VPI: the change to Virginia Tech was part of a rebranding campaign by the university, who found VPI to be a bit vanilla, not without reason, and &quot;Poly&quot; wasn't in the running. The Virginia Tech name has taken root for good as a shorthand, which is fine. 
:Most of time, I'm arguing in favor of [[WP:COMMONNAME]]: in fact, this is probably the first time that I haven't, and I think this points up a significant exception to the policy that has existed without notice until now. I make an analogy to [[WP:ENGVAR]]: we don't change between varieties of English without good cause: I see no compelling reason to alter an informal naming convention in this instance either. At some risk of an [[WP:OTHERSTUFF]] argument, if there is a &quot;convincing argument&quot; for this, then the argument is equally convincing for all the other Tech and State universities, which I suspect would be opposed. I haven't seen an article about the Sandusky affair that gave more than a nod to &quot;Pennsylvania State University,&quot; for instance. I seem to recall an extremely contentious discussion about the &quot;The&quot; in that case, but I don't think a rename to Penn State was ever seriously considered. Similar issues have come up concerning Ohio State. Virtually all articles on universities use the title/lede format format &quot;Northern North Carolina State University, also known as Northern State ...&quot; with a redirect from the informal name. &lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;[[User:Acroterion|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Acroterion&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Acroterion|&lt;font color=&quot;gray&quot;&gt;(talk)&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;''' 22:18, 20 November 2012 (UTC)
::The biggest thing I take from this is that no one is disputing the fact that Virginia Tech is the most common name. I reiterate that common names are preferable per both the the [[WP:AT]] policy and the college guideline [[WP:UNIGUIDE]], as well as in practice. It's simply not true that articles on colleges always use the &quot;official&quot; name; as was pointed out in the initial discussion, there are plenty of exceptions when something else is overwhelmingly more common. For example, it's [[Ohio State University]], not &quot;''The'' Ohio State University&quot;, [[Pennsylvania State University]], not &quot;''The'' Pennsylvania State University&quot;, [[Florida A&amp;M University]], not &quot;Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University&quot;, [[Louisiana State University]], not &quot;Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College&quot;, and [[Rutgers University]], not &quot;Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey&quot;. As such, the local consensus at this move request was in line with both policy and practice.&lt;br&gt;
::Taking this into consideration, I don't see any call to reverse the move unless it's by either another move request or it's overturned, for example by [[WP:MR|move review]]. I'll accept any outcome of a review, of course, but I continue to stand by my original decision.[[User:Cuchullain|CÃºchullain]] [[User talk:Cuchullain|&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]]/[[Special:Contributions/Cuchullain|&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt;]] 04:27, 21 November 2012 (UTC)

I don't have a strong opinion on the topic at hand but I am disappointed that no one has bothered to notify the [[WP:UNI|Wikiproject]] most concerned with this specific article and the broader topic of college/university naming conventions, especially when the initial RM was initiated.  If this discussion proceeds to an RfC or other more formal arena, please notify [[WP:UNI]] so its members can participate.

==Precedence and comparison==
Although I initially weighed in with a '''support''' !vote, now that I've had the chance to look a little further, I'm questioning whether this was the right move.  Here is a brief list of comparable articles that should be considered:
*[[California Institute of Technology]] (not Caltech)
*[[Florida Institute of Technology]] (not Florida Tech)
*[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (not Georgia Tech)
*[[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (not IIT or Illinois Tech)
*[[Indiana Institute of Technology]] (not Indiana Tech)
*[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (not MIT)
*[[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (not NJIT)
*[[New York Institute of Technology]] (not NYIT)
*[[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (not RPI)
*[[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (not RIT)
*[[State University of New York Institute of Technology]] (not SUNYIT)
*[[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] (Virginia Tech)
*[[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (not WPI)
Does Virginia Tech need to be the ''only'' outlier among polytechnic institutes? [[User talk:HokieRNB|Hokie]][[User:HokieRNB|RNB]] 14:55, 21 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Agree'''. It's also not e.g. [[Yale]] (very much the COMMONNAME) but [[Yale University]]. --[[Special:Contributions/78.35.246.146|78.35.246.146]] ([[User talk:78.35.246.146|talk]]) 18:56, 21 November 2012 (UTC)
*Because &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; sounds similar to &quot;Florida Tech&quot; we should treat both names the same way? You can't trust your instincts on this. You have to run the numbers, and see how the school presents itself in its literature. ''Chronicles'' has 89 examples of &quot;Florida Institute of Technology&quot; ({{google|&quot;Florida Institute of Technology&quot; site:chronicle.com}}), 30 for &quot;Florida Tech&quot; ({{google|&quot;Florida Tech&quot; site:chronicle.com}}). &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;â€” Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Kauffner |Kauffner ]] ([[User talk:Kauffner |talk]] â€¢ [[Special:Contributions/Kauffner |contribs]]) 19:55, 21 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:*It's not about numbers alone. I'm not sure why you think it would be related to &quot;instincts&quot;. And it's not because they ''sound'' similar. It's not a rhyming game.  It's about consistency. Alike articles should be named in alike ways. The list above reflects larger (4000 or more students) polytechnic institutes in the United States, of which Virginia Tech is one of the largest and most well-known. Florida Tech is probably not the best and most clear example; Georgia Tech and Caltech would be better. (&quot;Georgia Tech&quot; shows up 1000 to 1 over &quot;Georgia Institute of Technology&quot; in your search example; &quot;Caltech&quot; is 3 to 2 over &quot;California Institute of Technology&quot;.) I'm not suggesting that the Virginia Tech article shouldn't ultimately be renamed, I'm suggesting that the move was done prematurely without including needed input from a much larger community to gain consensus about ''how similar schools should be named''. [[User talk:HokieRNB|Hokie]][[User:HokieRNB|RNB]] 20:54, 21 November 2012 (UTC)
*As per [[User:HokieRNB|RNB]] the results show this result is out of line. As far as [[WP:COMMONNAME]] goes my increasing observation is that it is either badly written, or not read when cited, or both. We keep on seeing RM discussions that read/interpret the [[WP:COMMONNAME]] guideline as [[WP:STREETNAME]] [[WP:TABLOIDNAME]]  [[WP:NICKNAME]]. At the moment the guideline only says &quot;Article titles should be neither vulgar nor pedantic&quot; which rules out [[WP:VULGARNAME]] [[WP:PEDANTICNAME]] but doesn't tell Users whether en.wp wants to be an encyclopedia or USA Today. Even though in this case Google Books and Highbeam were used, not press, the result is a non-encyclopedic one. Which isn't anyone's fault, but is the result. [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 01:45, 22 November 2012 (UTC)
:*Upon further reflection, I believe that [[WP:COMMONNAME]] would support a move to [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]] (dropping the &quot;and State University&quot; part of the title), but the overriding guideline should dictate that it be named consistently with other similar polytechnic institutes. How soon is too soon to ask for such a move? [[User talk:HokieRNB|Hokie]][[User:HokieRNB|RNB]] 02:26, 22 November 2012 (UTC)
:::On the question of time I think you'd only need agreement of at least 3 people on this talk page to enter an immediate RM, given the small sample on the RM itself. I'll be the third if you get a second. However ''Virginia Polytechnic Institute'' was the old name pre-War, I doubt it'd get much support. The best non-colloquial alternative is back to where the article was. More talk/thought is probably necessary. &lt;s&gt;Opening an RfC on [[Talk:Florida Institute of Technology]] might be a better way to proceed.&lt;/s&gt;  [[User:In ictu oculi|In ictu oculi]] ([[User talk:In ictu oculi|talk]]) 02:50, 22 November 2012 (UTC)
::::There's no set period of time, or a specific number of users in &quot;agreement&quot;, for a new RM, though usually some amount of wait time is expected.

*I note that [[WP:NICKNAME]] leads to a page on username policy that is unrelated to article titling. IMO, we should use a name that might be given in a formal context like the ''New York Times'' or ''Chronicles of the Higher Education''. This is not something that can be determined by analogy-based reasoning. The school changed its short form name from VPI to Virginia Tech around 2000. &quot;Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&quot; was always just a lawyers' name. So even someone who went to the school in the 1990s might not have a sense of the current nomenclature. [[User:Kauffner|Kauffner]] ([[User talk:Kauffner|talk]]) 10:51, 22 November 2012 (UTC)
*Few editors like consistency in article titles as much as I do, but Kauffner is right. You can't just change names through analogy; that's [[WP:OTHERSTUFF]] applied to RM. If any of those other schools use their nicknames as consistency as Virginia Tech, it may be appropriate to rename them, but as evidence presented in the RM demonstrates, &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; is much more than an athletic nickname, which many of the above nicknames and abbreviations are. I wonder if the school itself would use the nickname as consistently as it does if its official name weren't so unwieldy, e.g., if it were Virginia Institute of Technology. But that's just speculation. As it stands, official usage, scholarly usage, journalistic usage, and common usage ''all'' agree on &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; in this case. Only a zealousness for official names completely without basis in policy would support the full nameâ€”that, or a misunderstanding of the situation, such as mistaking &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; for a purely athletic moniker. I'm happy with this RM being used as a precedent for other schools, but only when usage makes those moves prudent to begin with. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 00:36, 7 December 2012 (UTC)

==First SMC to Admit Women==
The article claims VT was the first college in the nation to admit women into its Corps of Cadets. The article gives no source for this and VT's own website states: &quot;In 1973 Virginia Tech was among the first Corps of Cadets in the nation to enroll women, assigning them to L Squadron.&quot; Nowhere does it say it was the first. On the other hand, here is an artcile that specifically states North Georgia College was the first SMC to admit women. http://digitalarchive.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1100&amp;context=eps_diss .

:I'm not sure I'd take either source as definitive to identify VT or NGC as solely &quot;first&quot;, since both claim 1973 and aren't more specific than the year.  Without a source offering a dated policy announcement, &quot;among the first&quot; is probably as close as we should get.

== List of peer institutions ==

Another editor and I disagree about the inclusion of a list of peer institutions in this article.  The material in question:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
=== Benchmark Institutions ===
Through a series of analyses and negotiations that occur about once every ten years, the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) approves a group of peers comparable to each Virginia college and university against which to benchmark faculty salaries. The target for each Virginia institution's overall faculty salary average is the 60th percentile of the average salaries of its peers. Criteria such as enrollments, academic program offerings and degrees awarded, research funding, and the classification of institutions of higher education developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education are used in the analysis to identify comparable peer institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peer Institutions and Comparisons|url=http://www.ir.vt.edu/work_we_do/PeerInstitutions/VT_Compared_Peers.html|publisher=Virginia Tech Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information about men's basketball coaching staff ==

Another editor and I disagree about the inclusion of two paragraphs of material about the new men's basketball coach and his staff.  The material in question:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In March 2014, Virginia Tech Director of Athletics Whit Babcock announced the hiring of [[Buzz Williams]] as the Hokies' new head men's basketball coach. Williams spent the previous six seasons as the head coach at Marquette University, where he compiled a 139-69 record and led the Golden Eagles to five NCAA appearances, including a trip to the regional finals in the 2012-13 season, the same season that the team won the Big East Conference's regular season title. During Williams's tenure, Marquette tallied a 69-39 record in the Big East Conference, and six Marquette players made it to the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buzz Williams named new Hokie coach|url=http://www.hokiesports.com/mbasketball/recaps/20140321aaa.html|publisher=HokieSports.com|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Williams announced his staff. Isaac Chew, Steve Roccaforte, and Jamie McNeilly were named assistant coaches. Jeff Reynolds was named the director of menâ€™s basketball operations. Devin Johnson will serve as the director of player personnel for menâ€™s basketball, and Steve Thomas as the director of student-athlete development. Lyle Wolf joined the staff as the assistant to the head coach, and Ernest Eugene was hired as assistant athletics director for sports medicine and will serve as the team athletic trainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hokies announce men's basketball staff|url=http://www.hokiesports.com/mbasketball/recaps/20140709aaa.html|publisher=HokieSports.com|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-sections in Athletics ==

I don't think &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; is need for the each of the subsection headings in [[Virginia Tech#Athletics]]. In other words, &quot;Baseball&quot;, &quot;Men's basketball&quot;, etc. seem perfectly fine. Removing &quot;Virginia Tech&quot; is simple enough as long as these subsections are not linked to by other articles. In that case, a [[WP:ANCHOR|anchor]] might be needed to redirect those links as needed. - [[User:Marchjuly|Marchjuly]] ([[User talk:Marchjuly|talk]]) 06:42, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

==Dining==
This is a great article with lots of information on many aspects of Virginia Tech. However, isn't it important to elaborate on the dining facilities located on campus for students? No minor flex plans are written, and only one dining hall (D2) is mentioned, shouldn't each dining hall be showcased?
