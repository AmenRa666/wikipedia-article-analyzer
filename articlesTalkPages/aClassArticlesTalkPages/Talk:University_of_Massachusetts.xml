==Notable alumni?==
The president of Samsung Electronics is UMass grad. Please someone add him to the notable alumni list. --Hychu

13:22, 5 September 2007 (UTC)~~Thomas Pock is a notable Alumn of University of Massachusetts-Amherst.  you already have him in the system of Wikipedia, but he deserves to be with the rest of Notable Alumni. Current member of the NY Rangers.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pock    &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/65.202.145.2|65.202.145.2]] ([[User talk:65.202.145.2|talk]]) 13:22, 5 September 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==&quot;Most violent campus&quot; controversy==

I moved the section on &quot;Most violent campus&quot; controversy to this talk page.  I figured it needed consensus.  --''[[User_talk:Markles|Mark Adler &lt;small&gt;(Markles)&lt;/small&gt;]]'' 23:11, 17 December 2005 (UTC).

Here was the reaction:
:# Someone tossed in an unsourced assertion that &quot;The University of Massachusetts-Amherst has the highest crime rate of any university in the country.&quot;
:# '''Quite properly,''' you removed it. 
:# I did some checking, and inserted a statement that ABC News ''said'' it had the highest rate of violent crime, and ABC News ''did'' say that. Or, at least, the Boston Globe says ABC News said that. I added that UMass officials said ABC News was full of bull, and gave their reasons. 
:#And I sourced this all to a Boston Globe article which anyone can verify for themselves at [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/11/17/umass_raps_data_as_primetime_prepares_to_air_crime_report/ this link].

:So, what's your issue? Did I give too much weight to ABC News and not enough to UMass? Has ABC issued a retraction? Do you think this item is unimportant? Do you think it's Wikipedia's job to present UMass in a positive light? Or what? [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] [[User_talk:dpbsmith|(talk)]] 23:20, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

:: OK.  You're right.  Back it goes to the article page.  --''[[User_talk:Markles|Mark Adler &lt;small&gt;(Markles)&lt;/small&gt;]]'' 01:12, 18 December 2005 (UTC).

:::Duh. (Striking forehead with base of palm). And now, over it goes to [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], since that's what the issue is about. [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] [[User_talk:dpbsmith|(talk)]] 01:49, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

:::: Looking at the actual available UMass Amherst crime statistics[http://www.umass.edu/umpd/statistics/2004%20Stats.pdf] (PDF Warning) Amherst currently has a [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/offense_tabulations/table_09.html#ma comparatively] low incidence of violent crime.  Considering major errors have been found in the assumptions of the controversy, it seems like this has been resolved in the main article.  Just pointing these stats out here.  

==Introduction==
I'm tinkering the introductory section to clue people in that they may want the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. I was wondering myself why ''this'' article is so skimpy. I'm also editing the pipes to read &quot;UMass Amherst,&quot; etc. as &quot;Amherst&quot; and &quot;Dartmouth&quot; by themselves tend to make people think of other educational institutions. I keep thinking that UMass really ought to start a campus in [[Harvard, Massachusetts]] just to make the confusion as complete as possible. [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] [[User_talk:dpbsmith|(talk)]] 02:19, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

==Residence Halls==
Doesn't that &quot;residence hall&quot; paragraph refer to [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst, too]]? [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] [[User_talk:dpbsmith|(talk)]] 02:19, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== Introductory wording ==

&quot;Is this wording better?&quot; Yes.

However, what it's lacking&amp;mdash;and what I'd like to see&amp;mdash;is something near the top of the page that positively encourages people to look at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]] article, because, without trying to put down the other campuses, it is what people usually think of when they think of UMass... and it's where most of the information on UMass is.

I'm going to try something... [[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] [[User_talk:dpbsmith|(talk)]] 18:27, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== Revert ==

I reverted to remove recently added reference to U Mass. Amherst being refered to as &quot;The Zoo&quot; or &quot;Zoo-Mass Slamherst&quot; since it does not appear to be [[WP:Verifiable|verifiable]]. --[[User:Hansnesse|Hansnesse]] 03:05, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

:Locally it is actually referred to as ZooMass, while it assuredly originated for a derogative purpose, it has come to be accepted more as a joke. It really doesn't seem belong on this page it would probably be better integrated in the actual Amherst page.

==Fair use rationale for Image:Umasslogo.gif==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:Umasslogo.gif]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Umasslogo.gif|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]].

== Unsubstantiated Claims for UMass Boston ==

On what grounds would anyone call UMass Boston a major research university? That's like calling New Hampshire a major center for the citrus industry. Living in Boston, I never hear of any research from UMB, except for some political polling. I need citations. I also need a citation for its being a “national model,” and I'm not counting the university’s own PR department.[[User:Bostoner|Bostoner]] ([[User talk:Bostoner|talk]]) 02:40, 19 July 2010 (UTC)
