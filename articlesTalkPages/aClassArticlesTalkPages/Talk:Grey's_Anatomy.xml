== Thumbnail images, upright images, and forced image widths ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grey%27s_Anatomy&amp;diff=494867191&amp;oldid=494850539 This] revert was unwise, because of how poor the forced image sizes look, particularly on smaller displays. I know many people now have giant screen monitors with 2560x1600 or greater resolutions. But plenty of others are still using 800x600. The way to make all that work is to respect the &lt;code&gt;|thumb&lt;/code&gt; parameter, so that when a user picks a particular default size that fits their display, they get a decent looking article. By the same token, upright images must use the &lt;code&gt;|upright&lt;/code&gt; parameter, or they'll look inexplicably huge. [[:File:Kate Walsh HBO party 08.jpg]] is the worst example of that on this page, though there are others. The [[:File:Greys Anatomy title.svg|title screen]], on the other hand is miniscule; it needs a ratio to the thumb size, with the &lt;code&gt;|upright=1.3&lt;/code&gt; parameter to expand it to about 130% (or so) of the user's default thumbnail width.&lt;P&gt;It's a really good idea to preview pages at a range of resolutions, with an appropriate change in your thumbnail size under Appearance in My Preferences, so as to understand how dynamic sizes serve different readers so much better than forcing a 200px or 300px wide upright image down their throat. --[[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 02:24, 29 May 2012 (UTC)
&lt;br&gt;
:I see your point, but I happen to have a small resolution computer and it looks fine. [[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; size=&quot;3px&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; size=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]) 02:34, 29 May 2012 (UTC)

::What's your default thumbnail size? And regardless of what your size is set to, having upright images three times as large as horizontal images does not look fine. It why the upright parameter exists. And then again, everyone who ''does'' have a ginmrmous monitor is really annoyed with your dinky little 200px image widths. Those are the people who asked for 300px-wide thumbnails in their user preferences, and you should give them what they asked for, not what looks fine on your screen. People with small screens asked for only 120px thumbnails and you're giving them 200. It's best to assume the reader is not an ignoramus, and knows what looks best for them. --[[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 02:58, 29 May 2012 (UTC)

:::My default size is 220px. I can now understand your point, feel free to change it back. Thank you for helping out the article, [[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; size=&quot;3px&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; size=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]) 03:02, 29 May 2012 (UTC)

==Paragraph 2 of the lead: aaaaaargh==
P2 of the lead is a completely inpenetrable blizzard of blue-links and contextless information. IMO it's a major turn-off for readers not well familiar with GA, and probably for those that are. It must be possible to convery some information about the subject matter and style of the series without resorting to some sort of edited highlights or TL:DR version of the entire season. I really very strongly recommend P2 should deal in much more general terms, such as are found in the Series Synposis - Overview section in the body of the article. --[[User:Tagishsimon|Tagishsimon]] [[User_talk:Tagishsimon|(talk)]] 21:12, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
:If this is a [[WP:Peer Review|peer review]] comment, please leave it at [[Wikipedia:Peer review/Grey's Anatomy/archive2]]. That being said, yes, I did not write that section of the lead, but it was modeled off of [[House (TV Series)|House]]'s second lead paragraph. Due to their being so many characters in the series, I do not really know what to do. A user, [[User:Lemonade51|Lemonade51]], is currently reading through the article, and will provide comments. Perhaps, he'll have an idea. [[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; size=&quot;3px&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; size=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]) 22:49, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
::'''Update''': Lead has since been fixed. [[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; size=&quot;3px&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot; size=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]) 16:56, 25 June 2012 (UTC)
:::No it hasn't. P2 of the lead is mostly a blizzard of names of characters which do nothing to summarise the TV series. P1 of the Overview section is much more the sort of thing I'd expect to find in the lead, with P2 of the lead tucked somewhere in the body of the article. Swap them around, even if only in preview mode. Does that not read better to you ''for a person hitherto uninformed about Grey's Anatomy'' ... which is presumably the person we should assume is reading it. Encyclopedias should assume no a priori knowledge. So Yes. A list of character names imparts pretty much zero by way of summary and and he cannot come there because he was there
 cannot form part of a well written lead. --[[User:Tagishsimon|Tagishsimon]] [[User_talk:Tagishsimon|(talk)]] 22:17, 4 October 2012 (UTC)
::::Calm down, the article and lead are in the process of a copyedit and restructuring. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 02:08, 5 October 2012 (UTC)

Suggestions:

* Infobox should say &quot;Official website&quot; not &quot;Website&quot; to avoid confusion
** That is not true. You're just saying that because that's how '''you''' prefer it as shown at Awake. House MD didn't say that (until you just changed it), and Ed, Edd n Eddy doesn't (don't change it). 
* Don't see reference for the producer and distributors for the series, only for executive producers on ref.

There is a picture of Latino Sara Ramirez. I was going to add a picture of [[Chandra Wilson]] to casting, but there is none available. A picture of [[James Pickens, Jr.]] wouldn't really belong anywhere. I would like to add one of [[Sandra Oh]], but cannot find an appropriate place.

== Copy editing notes ==

TRLIJC19 has asked me to copy–edit this article further, and I'm going to leave notes here as we progress. This is a long article, and copy editing will take a while.  It is my usual practice to edit the body of the article first, editing the lead only once the content of the article is stable.  I also usually start off with improvement of grammar and word choice, which is a good way to ensure I'm on the same page as the primary editor(s) before proposing or making major structural changes.  So...let's see how this goes. Feedback very welcome. [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 02:27, 2 August 2012 (UTC)

;Question re lead
Is the hospital initially named Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital?  The article suggests that the hospital's name was changed several years into the series.  Recommend that the original name of the hospital be used here. [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 02:31, 2 August 2012 (UTC)

;Length of the article &amp; proposed re-organization
I've looked at several other FAs and GAs of television series, and this one is quite a bit longer than others. (I figured that it was long when it was taking so long to load every time I made an edit.) There is a fair amount of duplication and repetition in the content, and it's my sense that some sections can be compressed significantly while still providing a solid survey article.  Some examples:
*The &quot;musical&quot; episode probably doesn't need such extensive coverage; it is very well covered in the standalone article, and only a line or two at most is required, probably in the &quot;overview&quot;. I'd suggest instead a better link to the fact that a soundtrack was issued for this particular episode in the &quot;Merchandise&quot; section. 
**I think I can briefly mention the musical episode in 'broadcast history'. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 01:23, 6 August 2012 (UTC) 
*Combine the &quot;conception&quot; and &quot;casting&quot; sections, moving the &quot;production&quot; section below that.  
** I don't think that's a good idea. [[House (TV series)]] is a FA (which I modeled this article off of), and that is the setup there. Conception is not directly related to casting. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 01:23, 6 August 2012 (UTC)
***Fair enough. However, please note that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=House_%28TV_series%29&amp;oldid=299074504 this is what House looked like] when it was promoted to FA; several of the sections mentioned in this subheading are not present, and many of the sections are significantly more focused. It is about 25-30% shorter than this article. [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 01:52, 6 August 2012 (UTC)
*The &quot;recurring characters&quot; section needs a good pruning.  Those of you more familiar with the show can identify which of the recurring characters are the most significant.  I'd suggest limiting the list to those who have appeared in 5 or more episodes, or 4 or more episodes over 2 or more seasons.
** I'll scan through that section tonight. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 01:23, 6 August 2012 (UTC) 
*** '''Update''': I've user your criteria, removing several characters, but in turn also adding a few missed ones. Regardless, this is a long show (8+ seasons) with an emphasis on cast, so that section will be big. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 19:26, 11 August 2012 (UTC)
*I'm inclined to do some serious compression of the &quot;Accolades&quot; section, as this is well covered under a daughter article already.
** I don't think that's necessary; I significantly covered the Emmys it received because that is the most prestigious award a series can receive. An idea of what you mean would be helpful. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 01:23, 6 August 2012 (UTC)  
*The &quot;US television ratings&quot;, &quot;broadcast history&quot;, and &quot;distribution&quot;  sections should be merged; there is a lot of repetition here. Only one table is needed, and I'd go with the one in &quot;US television ratings&quot;. Exact dates of release of the DVDs is not needed, as they are covered in the season-specific articles.  Is there any information about broadcast outside of the US? &lt;p&gt;[[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 23:24, 5 August 2012 (UTC)
**I don't think those three sections are related. US ratings covers the show's viewership and ratings, Broadcast history covers renewals and specials/webisodes, and Distribution covers how the show is streamed besides television plus DVDs. I do, however, agree that the release dates are not necessary, and that the broadcast history table can be erased. I have been completely unable to find information about airing outside the US; I found some things such as where it airs in Canada, but just including random ones would be applying undue weight. 

*Overall, I think since this is the main page for the entire scope of ''Grey's Anatomy''; everything should be covered using summary style, no matter what is included in the daughter articles. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 01:23, 6 August 2012 (UTC)

===Conception section===
I've done a major re-organization of this section, trying to provide a more logical flow: racial diversity paragraphs brought together, paragraphs about the development of a medical show brought together, reducing repetition.  
*I've shaved down one or two quotes, although I think it would probably be a good idea to try to convert more of them to prose paraphrases, as this section is quite heavy on quotations. 
*At the end of this section, I have &quot;commented out&quot; this bit, because the reference source is a tertiary source itself. At the bottom of the reference source the author identifies three reference sources from which the content was derived. I'd strongly suggest looking at those sources to support this statement, rather than using this one; I'm not convinced it would pass the [[WP:RS|reliable source]] smell test.
**&quot;Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from ''Grey's Anatomy'' to ''Complications'', although ultimately this did not come to pass.&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?date=02/04/05&amp;id=6822|title=Breaking News – Development Updates: February 4|date=February 4, 2005|publisher=The Futon Critic|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;
*Some additional tightening up is probably still needed; the section on the program's debut might more appropriately go in the &quot;Broadcast history&quot; section, for example.

Now, it is quite possible that you disagree with this revision.  If so, feel free to revert. If you are okay with it, then I will proceed with further sections tomorrow evening. [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 04:18, 8 August 2012 (UTC)

===Production section===
Apologies for the delays. Darn this real life interfering with Wikipedia work! I've copy-edited this section, but there are several points to be addressed by the primary editors that can't be addressed by copy-editing
*Placement of image:  Please see [[MOS:IMAGELOCATION]], this is something that is likely to catch you up at [[WP:FAC|FAC]]. You might want to check images in other sections as well. Depending on your point of view, you might want to do all of the image moving at once.
**I removed the one from production team, and will go through the others later. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 05:07, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
*Some of the references provided don't completely corroborate the statements, particularly those that say &quot;X has done Y since Season Z&quot;. I have no doubt the information is correct, and I'm not sure how to better provide that corroboration.
**I suppose if it's not backed, then perhaps it should be removed? &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 05:07, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
**'''Update''': I have an idea. The sentences that say when a crew member began working, can be backed with a {{template|cite episode}} reference of the crew member's first episode. Let me know what you think, &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 05:21, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
***Works for me. You might want to touch base with one or two of the editors who frequently review references at [[WP:FAC]] to see if this would be a reasonable workaround.  [[User:Nikkimaria|Nikkimaria]] is particularly talented in this area; she may have some other suggestions as well.  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 05:31, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
****The second you said it I thought of her name. I'll drop a post on her talk page. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 05:36, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
*****On the one hand, {{tl|cite episode}} is good for relatively trivial details - but if I watch the cited episode, am I going to know this is X's first appearance? Is he/she blatantly introduced in the episode, or do the credits mention that X is new to the show...or would I have to watch all the previous episodes and note that X appeared in none of them, making this episode X's first appearance? Citing an episode proves that X appeared in said episode, but depending on details provided may indicate only that X first appeared in this episode ''or earlier''. (All that being said, I'd have to get really nitpicky at FAC to catch this, and unless I already watched the show I probably wouldn't bother to review the episode. So you'd &quot;get away with it&quot; out of reviewer laziness ;-) [[User:Nikkimaria|Nikkimaria]] ([[User talk:Nikkimaria|talk]]) 13:38, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
*For ease of reading, I am only linking name of actor to role portrayed in the lead and casting sections; if not mentioned in the casting section, then the first time the character is mentioned. Thus, the two cast members who have directed are only mentioned by name and not by character (which isn't really material in this section). 
**I was only linking the two cast members with their character name in the crew section, because it was their first mention in the body of the article. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 05:07, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
*More to come, I have time to do another section tonight.  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 04:59, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
**Great, the work you did on crew was awesome, and I'm excited to see what you'll do with casting :-) &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 05:07, 19 August 2012 (UTC)

===Cast section, part 1 (first two paragraphs)===
Okay, this one is pretty tough. There are a lot of issues with the quality and completeness of references in this section. I started looking for better refs online (which is hard, given how much is written about this show)...but then I finally figured out that almost all of the salient information is already in the articles about the actors themselves.  I've only gotten to the end of the third season, with Kate Walsh leaving. Here are the list of references I recommend that you revisit; I'm going to leave it to you to format them, or pull them directly out of the relevant articles:
*&lt;S&gt;Sara Ramirez:  use the Oprah Winfrey ref from her article, but don't use the Youtube reference, find out which show it was on and use a cite television program reference format instead.  (There are serious questions about the appropriateness of linking directly to what is unquestionably copyright material on Youtube.)&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Washington's firing: use the [http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/tv/story/2007/06/08/abc-greys-washington.html CBC reference] in his article, which is complete and of much better quality
*Walsh moving to ''Private Practice'':  use the [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/arts/television/28grey.html?_r=1&amp;ref=television New York Times] article instead of the WSJ one, most of which is behind a paywall.&lt;/s&gt; 
*&lt;s&gt;I started working on the bit about Chyler Leigh. Recommend using [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20045450,00.html the People] ref from her article, which gives the info about the end of Season 3 and that she was continued as a cast member in season 4.&lt;/s&gt;
*This is as far as I'm going to get tonight (I have to find some local plumbers after my kitchen sink fell apart!), but you might want to look at improving some of the other references going on from that point, and make sure that the ones currently in use are at least as good and as complete as the ones in the articles for the actors.  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 04:07, 21 August 2012 (UTC)
===Cast section part 2 (the rest), Filming locations and techniques, and Merchandising===
*Casting section is done now. I've cut out the quote box, as it seemed out of place and a bit repetitive; however, you may wish to add it back. Referencing appears fine.
**I agree about the quote box; casting looks good. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 15:41, 4 September 2012 (UTC)
*Locations/Techniques, you might want to consider whether the full Sarah Drew quote is needed, or if it would be okay to paraphrase it instead; I've left it as is for now, but it is something to consider.
*I've done a first run through Merchandising, but I think it will need some further tweaking. I did a lot of work with the online store section; please check to make sure I've not changed any context there. 
*Footnotes seem a bit odd; I ran into Footnote &quot;e&quot; in Merchandising, but I am unfamiliar with that style of referencing, and the Footnotes section does not give the &quot;letter&quot; of the footnotes themselves. I think you'll need to have the footnote letters visible for the FAC. [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 07:54, 4 September 2012 (UTC)
**I was wondering why you repeated &quot;Meredith Grey&quot; in full in #Overview, because [[WP:SURNAME]] suggests otherwise. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 15:41, 4 September 2012 (UTC)

{{out}} I really appreciate your finding of these reviews, but they are not what I had in mind. In the weekly initiative, I said the article needed a season six review from &quot;[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Grey's Anatomy/Newsletter|a renowned major news site, or a well-known magazine]]&quot;. If you look at the [[Grey's Anatomy#Critical response|critical response]] section of the article, it is filled with reviews from renowned sites such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', etc. For an idea of other renowned critical review sites, see [[WP:TVRECEPTION]]. So while ''TV Fanatic'' is ''reliable'', it is not a renowned news site or magazine, as I was looking for. If you can find a season six review from a renowned site, please post it here. Thanks, &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 21:39, 30 August 2012 (UTC)

::::::It was not attitude. It was a general question.

You haven't written the WHOLE article. You may be one of its regular contributors but that doesn't mean that your word has more sway than anyone else's. I strongly suggest that you leave that term out in any future talk page discussions least it be taken the wrong way. And telling an editor to &quot;grow up&quot; is a borderline [[Wikipedia:Personal attack|personal attack]] and having been there myself, would ask you to refrain from such statements that could be taken the wrong way.

Just because it is the so called &quot;standard&quot; doesn't mean that [[Wikipedia:Consensus can change|the consensus for it's inclusion can change.]] . Especially when it's only relevant for one episode. It could be replaced in the lead with a single line explaining that it was the lead out for Super Bowl.

{{od}}Someone falsely claiming that he &quot;wrote the whole article&quot; is the epitome of [[WP:OWN|assuming ownership]]. And I'll also ask for more civility and less personalization of this legitimate discussion. Now, let's all remain calm and see if there are other opinions. That's the way it's done on Wikipedia. [[User:Cresix|Cresix]] ([[User talk:Cresix|talk]]) 18:39, 20 January 2013 (UTC)
:MisterShiney, with all due respect, you've been registered for 3 months, so please don't try to talk about your years of experience. As for &quot;''principal'' author&quot; (not ''principle''), several users such as the highly respected [[User:Ruhrfisch|Ruhrfisch]] use the term in regards to articles they wrote. If one of you writes an article, feel free to call yourself that. And yes, actually I ''have'' written the whole article, and I pushed it to GA and A-Class; feel free to check the history to validate if you feel the need. Please remind me when I said my opinion trumped others'. Oh right, I didn't. I introduced myself as the principal author because that's what I am. I could've introduced myself as the coordinator of [[WP:SGH|WikiProject ''Grey's Anatomy'']], but I don't see how that makes any difference. You should review WP:NPA, because it's not an &quot;attack&quot; to say grow up. If you want to change the consensus for the inclusion of the template, then discuss it at the post-Super Bowl talk page, because as I said, this article will not be the single deviation. MS, you clearly have no knowledge of proper WP:LEAD structure, because if you did, you would know that you can't just throw something in the lead and not mention it in the article's body. Cresix, it's not a false claim that I wrote the whole article. Believe it or not, I actually did. I'm not claiming ownership by saying this. And it's comical when you say &quot;the way it's done on Wikipedia&quot;, because with all due respect, I'm a user with 4.5 years of experience, buckets of recognized articles, and established credibility. I worked my ass off on this article, and I will not be barraged my two random editors. &lt;font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User:TRLIJC19|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;TRLIJC19&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]] • [[Special:Contributions/TRLIJC19|&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;contribs&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]])&lt;/font&gt; 21:47, 20 January 2013 (UTC)
::I see you have been looking at my user page. If you look closer, you will see that I was an IP editor for a number of years before I registered. This was mainly because I was on a dynamic IP and so kept getting abuse and unexplained reverts, accusations of sock puppetry for &quot;not having enough edits&quot; etc etc. As for Cresix, he has been editing almost as long as you if you check his history. 
::To be fair, I did say BORDERLINE. It's all about being civil and telling someone to grow up, having been there and said that, not only shows a lack of maturity on the person who said its part, but will automatically get the other person's back up. I constantly am learning this lesson. I would say that to any any editor who gave that sort of introduction because its  peacockery (not talking about the policy) by saying &quot;hey look at me, aren't I awesome?&quot; and is like you, unintentionally or not, are looking down on other editors. 
::I have looked at the lead policy, and I saw that it was indeed already mentioned in the article in the US Television Ratings where it said that it was a lead-in from Super Bowl XL.
:: You're not being &quot;barraged&quot; by two editors, one person popped in to ask a justified question, you came in claiming you wrote the entire article when you didn't even start it and it has over 3800 editors editing it. You may have done extensive work on it since then (kudos by the way, awesome work) but please be aware of how you speak to other editors. Coming in flouting creds like that just gets people's back up and comes across like you are saying that your opinion trumps others - even if you are not saying it directly. Just let your reputation speak for itself. Just by clicking on your user page you can see the awesome extensive work you have done. But we are right in saying it's borderline acting like you own the page.  Which I am sure, from your explanations, was not intentional. 
:: Anyway, this seems to have gotten blown out of proportion and completely off topic. I beleive the question was answered and am happy to leave it there and strongly suggest that if  Cresix is that concerned he should take it to the Super Bowl page. &lt;span style=&quot;border:2px solid black;margin-top:2px;bottom:2px;font- verdana;background:orange&quot; &gt; [[User:MisterShiney|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;'''MisterShiney'''&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:MisterShiney|&lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;✉&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;  23:06, 20 January 2013 (UTC)
:::TRLIJC19, repeatedly making false claims does nothing to help your arguments.

As I said above, I do not claim ownership for this page (by the way, you can stop linking WP:OWN). As MisterShiney said, if you want to change the standard, talk about it at the appropriate central page.

The cast table on the main page is currently too wide for some browsers, and won't hold any further seasons after the twelfth. I have attempted to replace it with the table from the &quot;characters&quot; page (below), but it keeps getting reverted by users who state the current table is &quot;fine&quot;.

:The current table is definitely fine, as it's not too wide for the page and yes, future seasons will fit perfectly on the table. Please refer to the [[ER (TV series)|ER]] page as they have 15 seasons under it's belt and the character table is totally readable and ordered.
