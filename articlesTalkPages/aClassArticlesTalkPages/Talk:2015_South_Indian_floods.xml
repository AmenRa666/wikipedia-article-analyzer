== Flood hit in Cuddalore District Thousands Rescued ==

Almost all roads and residential areas in the Cuddalore town and neighbouring areas were inundated as the heavy rain that started on Tuesday continued till Friday night.
Several thousands of people have been rescued from flood-hit areas. On Wednesday, the district administration arranged food for about 30,000 people from the flooded areas.

In the Cuddalore town, all government offices were flooded, and there was one-foot-high water on the road from the post office bus stop to the government hospital.

Cuddalore has been witnessing extremely heavy rainfall since last few days. In just five days, from November 30 to December 4, 2015, the city recorded 503 mm of rain. The conditions are similar to Chennai floods and Puducherry rains.

While rains in and around Chennai did lose steam in the last 24 hours, Cuddalore continued to receive good rains, recording 87 mm in 24 hours from 8:30 am IST on December 3, 2015. On December 3, Cuddalore received 132.8 mm of rain. On December 2 as well, the city received three-figure rainfall, recording a whopping 134.8 mm.

Cuddalore lies on coastal Tamil Nadu which has been witnessing vigorous weather activity, in terms of excessive rains, since last month. The city is located in central coastal Tamil Nadu, to be precise. This region has been battered by incessant heavy rainfall causing water stagnation and inundation.

The situation was worrisome in some villages in the Panruti, Kurinjipadi, Chidambaram and Kattumannarkoil blocks.

NLC has stopped pumping out water from its mines. There is no power production in the NLC’s Thermal Power Station-I. In total, the NLC is generating just 680 MW when its total capacity is 2,990 MW.

Meanwhile, Puducherry received 30.6 cm rainfall from 8.30 am on Tuesday to 8.30 am on Wednesday.  Consequent to the release of excess water from the Sathanur and Veedur dams, the Thenpennai and the Sankarabharani are filled to capacity.  According to Collector D Manikandan, of the 110 lakes, 103 were full and the water level in the Veedur dam touched 31 ft. The Collector further said that a NDRF team was expected to reach Puducherry and that medical teams were on standby.&lt;ref&gt;http://allinone-india.com/flood-hit-in-cuddalore-district-thousands-rescued/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dalit Suffering ==

There is only source and as such the section has no place in Wikipedia under [[WP:Redflag]]. Moreover the news is just one report from one source and was from a survey conducted in one district. It cannot be generalized to forward a POV that Dalit's were neglected/discriminated by the government or anyone. Even the report clearly states that relief was provided based on accessibility of areas and not caste.
[[User:CatapultTalks|CatapultTalks]] ([[User talk:CatapultTalks|talk]]) 20:18, 9 December 2015 (UTC)

Agree that this survey is specific to one district. That's evidently not the point; the survey was intended to be conducted in one district. The story is properly sourced and has received coverage by many mainstream newspapers and press agencies, so meets the criteria of WP: Verifiability. According to the report, relief was indeed provided based on accessibility of areas, but only dominant-caste persons resided/could reside in those areas, not Dalits. As the news story is verifiable, the sub-section should remain in the &quot;Controversies&quot; section whether the report is ultimately proven true or otherwise; the sub-section could be retitled to note ''allegations'' of caste-based discrimination in Cuddalore district, etc..[[User:Aumnamahashiva|Aumnamahashiva]] ([[User talk:Aumnamahashiva|talk]]) 20:52, 10 December 2015 (UTC)

== Wrong information ==

''Several notable actors donated towards relief efforts, including Rajinikanth (₹1 crore (US$149,300)), Dhanush (₹5 lakh (US$7,465)), Vijay (₹5 crore (US$746,500)), Raghava Lawrence (₹1 crore (US$149,300)), Suriya and Karthi (₹25 lakh (US$37,325)), Vishal (₹10 lakh (US$14,930)), Allu Arjun (₹25 lakh (US$37,325)), Varun Tej (₹3 lakh (US$4,479)), and Sai Dharam Tej (₹3 lakh (US$4,479), in food and medicines)'' - seems wrong information, Please do the needful --[[User:Selvasivagurunathan m|Selvasivagurunathan m]] ([[User talk:Selvasivagurunathan m|talk]]) 15:32, 20 December 2015 (UTC)
