== Comment ==

Your listing for the 40th Infantry Division (M) indicates that it is a &quot;likely&quot; subordinate unit to I Corps.  You are correct.  HOWEVER, you indicate the 40th is the North Carolina Guard.  WRONG!  Try the California Army National Guard.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:198.81.26.105|198.81.26.105]] ([[User talk:198.81.26.105|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/198.81.26.105|contribs]]) 11:32, 7 February 2004.&lt;/small&gt;

I may be mistaking, but I think that the I corps is currently in Northen Iraq, relieving the 101st Air Assaut division.&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:62.161.27.52|62.161.27.52]] ([[User talk:62.161.27.52|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/62.161.27.52|contribs]]) 09:31, 23 July 2004.&lt;/small&gt;


Isn't this the unit in M*A*S*H? Guess they made up the part about it being in Korea...[[User:Kuralyov|Kuralyov]] 20:31, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:No, &quot;eye core&quot; was there, our unit history is just incomplete. See [[U.S. Eighth Army Korean War order of battle]] for instance. [[User:Stan Shebs|Stan]] 21:16, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== ACW connection ==

Someone just edited in:

: The current I Corps is a different organization than the I Corps of the Union Army during the [[American Civil War]].

If that is in fact true, we should delete the ACW portion of this article and just have a See Also. Can anyone confirm? [[User:Hlj|Hal Jespersen]] 18:56, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

Prior to World War I, Corps were not the same sort of structure they were from World War I on. Before that time, they were NOT permanent units, but were organized for each conflict, and were numbered Ordinally for each Army. It was only from World War I that Corps were Constituted and Organized with a permanent structure, Lineage and honors. The one thing that is consistent between the earlier and latter Corps - the insignia used for the single digit corps. MOST of them took their insignia from their pre-WW=I versions.

== 1st Infantry Division ==

In this article, it says that the [[Big Red One]] is part of the I Corps, but in the Big Red One article and the [[U.S. V Corps|V Corps]] article, it says that it is part of the V Corps. Which is it?&lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:71.241.236.185|71.241.236.185]] ([[User talk:71.241.236.185|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/71.241.236.185|contribs]]) 11:21, 3 April 2006.&lt;/small&gt;

::Units are never permanently assigned to a Corps. During World War II, most units in multi-Corps theaters were assigned to multiple corps over the duration of the war.

== I Corps (FWD) in Iraq? ==

Is there any evidence that I Corps (fwd) was in Iraq in 2004?  I was in Iraq then, but not in Mosul, and never heard that they were there.  III Corps had the corps mission then, so what did I Corps (fwd) do there?  [[User:CsikosLo|CsikosLo]] ([[User talk:CsikosLo|talk]]) 13:06, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

== I Corps (Fwd) No Longer Headquartered in DC ==

I Corps (Fwd) is now headquartered at Camp Zama, Japan as of June 2008 &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Kenny.mishler|Kenny.mishler]] ([[User talk:Kenny.mishler|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kenny.mishler|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== 30th Infantry Division not in I Corps in WWII ==

Greetings. I'm brand-new to Wikipedia, so please forgive me if I violate any protocol. I will learn it. 

At any rate, 30th Infantry Division (Old Hickory) was not under I Corps in the Pacific Theatre in WWII. 30th ID was in the European Theatre from June 1944 through the end of the war. 

--[[User:CPLgrumpy|CPLgrumpy]] ([[User talk:CPLgrumpy|talk]]) 23:54, 28 April 2011 (UTC)

Perhaps it's worth noting that I Corps was at Ft Jackson early in the war, same time 30th was forming/training. I suppose I find it worth making a separate entry for subordinate divisions while I Corps was at Jackson.

== How to pronounce I Corps? ==

I have always wondered how to pronounce &quot;I Corps&quot; and all the other corps as well, and in fact came here to learn it.  Is it &quot;Eye Corps&quot;?  &quot;One Corps&quot;?  &quot;First Corps&quot;?  I think it would be nice if this article said which was correct.[[Special:Contributions/173.62.11.254|173.62.11.254]] ([[User talk:173.62.11.254|talk]]) 14:02, 15 October 2016 (UTC)</text>
