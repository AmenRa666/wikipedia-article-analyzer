== Inaccuracies ==
Sigh...where do I begin?  For starters, why don't we try finding some sources for the &quot;facts&quot; section. [[User:Jdorje|Jdorje]] 18:53, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

:How about sources in general that are online? I am getting to hate that encyclopedia of hurricanes. Not all of us have that, and it hard to verify that information we (at least I) don't have. [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] 19:57, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

==Merge==
::Anyone still opposed? [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] 21:41, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Opposed to a merge?  Yes, I don't think this one should be merged.  By all accounts (I did a quick google print search) this was a monolithic storm, and satisfies both notability and quantity-of-info criteria.  My complaint is just about the sloppy writing and research. [[User:Jdorje|Jdorje]] 22:14, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

::::Sorry, that was meant for another article. As you can probably see based on your watchlist, I'm going through the articles and adding [[List of notable Atlantic hurricanes]], and that was meant for another storm. You are completely right, this is an important storm based on what's written. I still, however, want some online souces... [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] 22:20, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

Strongly opposed to any merge. Sure, the information isn't great but it isn't a very well-known storm anyway and information will be scarce for historic hurricanes. It is far and away article-worthy. [[User:CrazyC83|CrazyC83]] 04:00, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

== 917 mbar ==

What's the source for the 917 mbar pressure?  Is it from the book reference?  The online reference given does not seem useful since it links to a directory of PDF files; what am I supposed to do here?  I find the 917 mbar hard to reconcile with the [[1900 Galveston Hurricane]] where a measruement of 930? mbar was considered &quot;obviously in error&quot; - how can these two &quot;facts&quot; be explained? — [[User:Jdorje|jdorje]] &lt;small&gt;([[User_talk:jdorje|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:09, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

:The directory of PDF files gives the information from the article. When I added that information, I just linked that at the bottom so I wouldn't have to link every last page for every little detail. Just to let you know, the pressure link is located [http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~jelsner/HHITProject/HHITyears/1846/storm2_pt1_other.pdf here].

== Spanish info from &quot;Huracan de 1846&quot; ==

*In Havana, the hurricane damaged churches and four convents
*Roofs, walls, and windows were damaged at the [[University of Havana|Real Universidad]] 
*Office of the [[Real Audiencia]] damaged, with doors and walls wrecked
*Governor house was damaged, including the main gate, several destroyed walls, and Aztec lighting fixtures
*The principal theatre in Havana was also damaged, as were post offices
*Two military barracks were damaged (Walls and windows damaged). In one, the [[sump]] overflowed, contaminating the clean water supply. 
*A mental health hospital lost a wall and an infirmary, and several other hospitals sustained similar damage
*[[Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca]] - walls and windows damaged, as was the building directing ship traffic
*2792 houses were knocked over or destroyed in Havana, while most others had damage to windows or walls; about 4,000 houses damaged were damaged between Havana and its suburbs
*Dozens of damaged ships in the harbor of Havana, which wrecked sugar, tobacco, and other items onboard
*1258 trees downed in the city
*2314 people left homeless
*Officials took up a collection to help residents who were affected on October 13 through the 28th, raising 8094 pesos
*In [[Güines]], the storm wrecked large amounts of [[guano]], as well as damaging the local church, school, and hospital.
*The width of the heaviest damage was about 70 to 80 miles across Cuba
*Strong winds also recorded in Bahamas

A ton of boats were damaged or destroyed, and there is a huge list of people that were injured or killed, but there is just too long of a list to go through, sorry. It goes into detail by other areas outside of Havana, but it's just too much text. Hope some of this helps! ♫ [[User:Hurricanehink|Hurricanehink]] (&lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Hurricanehink|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;)  20:45, 29 January 2014 (UTC)
:Thanks a ton for this, Hink! Now I just have to figure out how to cite this.... &gt;:D [[User:Cloudchased|Cloudchased]] ([[User talk:Cloudchased|talk]]) 21:15, 29 January 2014 (UTC)</text>
