==Untitled==
Yeah i made this page and it rocks --[[User:Citikiwi|Citikiwi]] 06:31, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

== Advertising ==

:Although there was little or no paid advertising by SPBCL or the retailers regarding the Sylvia Park branches
I removed the above statement as it is untrue. I received a Warehouse Sylvia Park junkmail/flyer with the opening day specials. I also distinctly remember seeing an ad on TV during the Queens bday weekend for Sylvia Park. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 14:34, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

== Dates confusing ==

:KIPT acquired the land in two transactions, on October 1995 and June 24

This is a bit confusing. June 24 what year? If it's 1995 it should be changed to June 24 and October 1995 or something of that sort [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 11:16, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

== Location ==

The page originally stated it's in Panmure. But the Sylvia Park page gives it's address as in Mt Wellington. It's location is also in Mt Wellington as far as I can tell in my Wises map. So unless someone could show the suburb boundries or other evidence it's in Panmure, I would have to assume the Syliva Park page is correct and it's in Mt Wellington not Panmure. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] 11:29, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

- you are right it is definitely in Mt Wellington as opposed to Panmure. [[User:Dippit|Dippit]] 00:52, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

==Big Thanks==
Citikiwi says thanks for expanding the page because I have absolutely no info about the center, nor do I live in Auckland [[User:Citikiwi|Citikiwi]] 07:44, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

== Sir Maurice O'Rourke ==

It is extremely doubtful that Sir Maurice O'Rourke had a house in Sylvia Park.
What is for sure is that he had a house on the northern side of what was once Mt Smart, which was situated between Maurice Road 
and O'Rourke (and Station Road and Church Street) in Penrose.

The twelve room house had two stories built of Kauri with two sets of stairs (the &quot;back stairs&quot; for the use of his servants who were accommodated in an separate three room building). 

There was a stable with two stalls and two storage rooms. Plus two green houses.

The gardens were extensive including a grotto. There were four giant (by 1960) Norfolk Pines and two large Pohutukawas astride the house. The meandering drive up to the house was about 150 yards in length.

The house was destroyed by fire in 1966.

How do I know all this? 

I lived there 1940 though 1963. It was the home of my father, Veterinary Surgeon Herbert Clinton Kennan who operated 
the Blue Cross Hospital there for small animals.

{{Substituted comment|length=244|lastedit=20071123035024|comment=Rather than&quot;which passes directly through the shopping centre on a viaduct&quot; it would be more accurate to say that &quot;which passes directly ''over'' the shopping centre on a viaduct&quot;. I'm a newbie and I can't seem to edit that part of the article.}}
