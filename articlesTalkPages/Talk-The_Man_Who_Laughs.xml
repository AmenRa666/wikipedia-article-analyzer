== Bias? ==

Should the synopsis be this biased? It is not the place of a synopsis to inform the readers that the exposition is &quot;clumsy&quot;, etc.

No, it should not - if you ever see anything that violates [[WP:NPOV]] either delete it or rephrase it to make it nonbiased. -- [[User:Gizzakk|Gizzakk]] 06:34, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

:I’d also question the assertion: “Although among Hugo's most obscure works…” On what basis is such a statement made…? It certainly is remembered today, if only for the film adaptation, and by association, the development of the look of The Joker. Perhaps it wasn’t successful in Hugo’s day, or was a comparative failure compared to the success/ sales of his other works - I don’t know, but as it stands it sounds un-encyclopædic to me… [[Special:Contributions/86.136.164.71|86.136.164.71]] ([[User talk:86.136.164.71|talk]]) 16:49, 6 June 2013 (UTC)

== Film Date ==

I thought the film version was made in 1928 not 1927 as the article says. Does anyone else know? [[User:71.76.136.149|71.76.136.149]] 04:06, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

== Inspiration for the Joker, side comment ==

I have something of a problem with comparing the Joker to Hannibal Lecter, but am hesitant to simply delete the comment out of hand.  Other than the level of amoral genius both characters have, I don't really see any resemblance.  If there's any agreement with my reservation, then I'll happily put my name on the edit.

== Eliminated enormous bias ==

This article has to be one of the most biased on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not the place for a book review, and some of the &quot;facts&quot; listed in the summary were simply wrong. This part was particularly amusing:

&quot;Although there are passages of great power in ''The Man Who Laughs'', there are also long passages of excess verbiage and barely relevant asides, with poorly-realised subsidiary characters who ultimately have no relevance to the plot. Among the novel's major weaknesses is the very poor definition of the main female character, Dea. Whatever Hugo's intentions may have been, Dea is a collection of frailties rather than a person. In the firm tradition of Little Nell (from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''), Little Eva (from [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'') and Beth March (from [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''[[Little Women]]''), Dea is one of those waif-like Victorian ingenues who seem to exist for the sole purpose of having a climactic death scene.&quot;

It is also wrong. I did an extensive clean-up on this article. [[User:LaszloWalrus|LaszloWalrus]] 09:50, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

== External Links ==

The external &quot;litrix.com&quot; link is failing for me, currently. Would there be any problems with linking to the novel's entry on [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12587 &quot;Project Gutenburg&quot;]? [[User:Kasha.re|&amp;#39;Kash]] 02:48, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

== Gary Pulliam abridgement ==

There have been two removals of identical text from someone whose only contribution to Wikipedia is this paragraph. I figured I would open discussion here. The only reference I can find to the book is the [https://www2.xlibris.com/bookstore/bookdisplay.asp?bookid=45311 XLibris entry]. There are no reviews, no commentaries, just a place to buy the book. I'm not one to impose rigorous demands of notability, but is there anything to this book other than a sales pitch? We're not trying to be unreasonable here, but there need to be some standards. -[[User:SeanDuggan|Fuzzy]] ([[User talk:SeanDuggan|talk]]) 14:43, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

:This is written as an ad for a self-published abridged version -- i.e., a [[vanity press]] book. This is an [[WP:SPAM|ad]]. [[User:Therefore|&amp;#8756;&amp;nbsp;Therefore]] | &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Therefore|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:30, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

==Synopsis==
It would be great if we could also have a brief synopsis (3 sentences) in addition to the fairly long plot summary.  Thanks, [[User:Maikel|Maikel]] ([[User talk:Maikel|talk]]) 13:03, 2 September 2008 (UTC)
:No article needs both a &quot;brief synopsis&quot; ''and'' a plot summary.  This article's plot summary is more than twice the size allowed by WP policy, and must be severely truncated. It contains a ridiculous amount of detail, and does not paint a clear picture of the novel's plot. [[Special:Contributions/12.233.147.42|12.233.147.42]] ([[User talk:12.233.147.42|talk]]) 20:49, 29 February 2016 (UTC) [EDIT] I have now reduced this morass from 1400+ words to 722 words. If someone can reduce it further, please do so. [[Special:Contributions/12.233.147.42|12.233.147.42]] ([[User talk:12.233.147.42|talk]]) 02:38, 2 March 2016 (UTC)

== Probable false information about F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre ==

The unsourced paragraph under &quot;Allusions&quot; about Jerzy Kosinski's Pinball is almost certainly false.  &quot;After Kosinski's death, it was determined that at least two uncredited “ghost writers” made substantial contributions to this novel and other works credited to Kosinski&quot;— this is an inaccurate description of the case that was made during Kosinski's life (and which may have contributed to his suicide) that he was not the sole author of his works, which dates back to the early 1980s.  Despite being made in various forms over the years, there has never been a definitive answer on this subject and the claim that two other authors have been definitively credited with his work is simply false.  Furthermore, the author mentioned, F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre, though a writer of some small renown, was also a known hoaxer and fabulist who almost certainly invented the claim that he was one of Kosinski's ghost writers, based simply on the coincidence of the name Gwynplaine being used in the book.  (Surely Kosinski's editors would not allow such an obvious clue to be slipped in by one of the secret ghost-writers!)[[User:Mgmax|Mgmax]] ([[User talk:Mgmax|talk]]) 22:56, 24 October 2010 (UTC)

== By Order of the King ==

What's the history of the alleged &quot;By Order of the King&quot; title? I also find &quot;By The King's Command&quot;; what's the relevant French title? (I'm confused by this.) --[[User:Jpgordon|jpgordon]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Jpgordon|::==( o )]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:26, 23 November 2011 (UTC)

== Dostoyevsky ==

The book is also referenced in Dostoyevski's novel &quot;Demons&quot;.

&quot;вот тут на столе, под книгой, под «L’homme qui rit».[50] Какое мне дело, что она убивается о Ни-ко-леньке!&quot;

Something like &lt;&lt;here, on the table, under the &quot;L’homme qui rit&quot;.&gt;&gt; - cannot translate correctly.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/194.150.65.245|194.150.65.245]] ([[User talk:194.150.65.245|talk]]) 15:21, 1 August 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== I edited, according to the wiki article about Victor Hugo ==

&quot;After leaving France, Hugo lived in Brussels briefly in 1851, before moving to the Channel Islands, first to Jersey (1852–1855) and then to the smaller island of Guernsey in 1855, where he stayed until 1870.&quot;  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/94.43.28.55|94.43.28.55]] ([[User talk:94.43.28.55|talk]]) 20:22, 3 September 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
