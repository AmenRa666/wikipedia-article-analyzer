==OCD Formatting Issue==
The items in the list under Description should be separated by commas and not semi-colons, because the items that are separated do not themselves contain lists of items separated by commas.

== Photo request ==

It would be nice to have a real-color photo, to replace or complement the false-color one currently in the infobox. -- [[User:Beland|Beland]] ([[User talk:Beland|talk]]) 19:43, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

:I found two images of Kilauea on Flickr, added them to Wikimedia Commons and included one image in the infobox. A better image would still be very useful. [[User:GeoWriter|GeoWriter]] ([[User talk:GeoWriter|talk]]) 17:11, 26 May 2010 (UTC)
::Agreed.  Please see the next section. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 09:00, 8 August 2010 (UTC)

::Agreed. The current image is misleading. The labeling &quot;Kileauea shield volcano&quot; suggests that the shield seen in the image is the entire Kilauea volcano, which it most certainly is not. It is probably Mauna Ulu, a tiny subordinate shield built on the East Rift of the much larger (and much harder to photograph in its entirety) Kileauea shield. [[User:Asimow|Asimow]] ([[User talk:Asimow|talk]]) 19:50, 28 October 2010 (UTC)

== Lead image ==

Please help choose a better infobox image. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 08:59, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
*I just went through the available images in Commons... not a lot of good choices for the infobox picture. I'd like to see a current shot of the caldera from the air with Mauna Loa in the background. I agree that the current shot is misleading and should be improved. [[User:Jusdafax|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Jus&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Jusdafax|&lt;font color=&quot;C1118C&quot;&gt;da&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Jusdafax|&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;fax&lt;/font&gt;]]  05:04, 14 October 2011 (UTC)
** Could I suggest this public domain image? http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-80/images/JPG/large_screen/RIFT_098.jpg, which is from [USGS DDS-80 http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-80/album.html] It shows Kilauea Caldera looking down at Pu'u 'O'o, with the ocean in the background.  Alternatively, there is this image, http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/update/archive/2011/Mar/20110728_7643_torrA_L.jpg, which shows Pu'u 'O'o in the foreground, with the summit plume from Kilauea's summit vent further up, with Mauna Loa behind it (a similar view can be seen here: http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/update/archive/2011/Jan/20110120_torr_2077_A_L.jpg and at http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/update/archive/2008/Apr/20080408-4242-jpk_L.jpg). Or, this image, http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/update/archive/2009/Jun/20090731_6330_jk_L.jpg, which shows the summit caldera with Mauna Loa in the background. All images are produced by the USGS and are in the public domain. [[User:Aoi|青い(Aoi)]] ([[User talk:Aoi|talk]]) 19:57, 14 October 2011 (UTC)
:::I substituted a shot of Kilauea Iki (I think), which is a little better than the Mauna Ulu image. I like Aoi's suggestion of [http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/kilauea/update/archive/2011/Mar/20110728_7643_torrA_L.jpg], which really shows the vast mass of Kilauea. If other people like that one, I can upload it. —[[User:Hike395|hike395]] ([[User talk:Hike395|talk]]) 20:27, 14 October 2011 (UTC)

== Pronunciations ==

I don't know enough about Hawai'ian to know for sure, but I'm not sure that's right. And the English pronunciation (roughly, &quot;key-lao-AY-a&quot;) seems really off to me. I have always heard it pronounced &quot;kill-a-WAY-a&quot;, /kIl.@.weI.@/ in [[SAMPA]] transcription. Someone else needs to look at those and decide if they're right. [[Special:Contributions/76.242.155.180|76.242.155.180]] ([[User talk:76.242.155.180|talk]]) 23:38, 21 October 2010 (UTC)

:I was just about to raise the same issue. The supposed Hawaiian pronunciation in particular looks very dubious to me. Unless we get confirmation or correction, I propose to delete both (in hours or days, not years). [[User:Awien|Awien]] ([[User talk:Awien|talk]]) 11:44, 26 May 2016 (UTC)

== Rewrite ==

I currently have a rewrite of this article pending in my [[User:Resident Mario/sandbox|sandbox]]. I think I will be able to replace the current content and continue work towards a potential GA or FA star in the near future, but I would really appreciate some help. Thanks, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Verdana,Arial,Helvetica&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#333&quot;&gt;[[User:Resident Mario|Res]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#444&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Resident_Mario#top|Mar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 03:43, 30 January 2012 (UTC)
:Have you thought about making a checklist so that others can just take a look at what needs to be done and address missing topics or cleanup as needed?  That might help speed things along. [[User:Viriditas|Viriditas]] ([[User talk:Viriditas|talk]]) 13:44, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

== Coordinates ==
Loading better coordinates which place one just north of the rim, and on the same side as the observatory. Coords = 19°24′46″N 155°17′12″W.  The idea here is to allow links to show volcano without obscuring the view.  Should I place it at the crater center instead?  [[User:Mfbabcock|EtherDoc]] ([[User talk:Mfbabcock|talk]]) 12:01, 22 September 2012 (UTC)
:Coordinates, like other information in Wikipedia, is supposed to avoid [[WP:OR|original research]] by being [[WP:V|verifiable]] in a [[WP:RS|reliable source]]. The most reliable source for horizontal and vertical coordinates is the [[National Geodetic Survey]], which allows data search [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_radius.prl here]. What we usually do is find the highest benchmark that is on the mountain and report its location and height. The best benchmark I found was this one: {{NGS|TU2382|4088}}, at the &quot;highest point on the Western Rim&quot;, elevation {{convert|4091|ft|m}}, {{coord|19|25|16|N|155|17|12|W}}. I'll update the infobox accordingly. —[[User:Hike395|hike395]] ([[User talk:Hike395|talk]]) 14:53, 22 September 2012 (UTC)

Nice, but I found some better benchmarks.
Current benchmark TU2382  (way off from crater)
  19° 25′ 16″N         155° 17′ 12″W
Better one TU2384  &quot;SOUTH RIM&quot; 
  19° 24′ 37.03227″N   155° 17′ 27.17230″W
or  TU2383  &quot;NORTH RIM&quot;
  19° 24′ 54.36933″N   155° 17′ 16.69006″W
http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=TU2384
http://img.geocaching.com/benchmark/3f7f3417-838e-416a-a9b1-3682c3af6d0a.jpg
Maybe I'll fix the coords when I find time.  Or maybe someone else can do it.

== 1790 to 1934 ==

I can't find justification in the quoted sources for the claim that: &quot;One pre-contact eruption in particular, a phreatomagmatic event in 1790, formed the volcano's present day caldera...&quot;. The rest is good, the footprints of Keōua's soldiers, but that this event formed the present caldera? I'm highly dubious. Unless anyone can produce a better reference, I propose to cut that statement. [[User:Awien|Awien]] ([[User talk:Awien|talk]]) 16:30, 2 August 2013 (UTC)
*I have pulled it out, thanks. It should have been removed a year ago.

:::Thanks, [[User:Jusdafax|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Jus&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Jusdafax|&lt;font color=&quot;C1118C&quot;&gt;da&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Jusdafax|&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;fax&lt;/font&gt;]]. I really need to keep a to-do list - I'd completely forgotten this.

== Mauna Ulu ==

I'm puzzled as to why Mauna Ulu redirects to Kīlauea. It easily merits an article in its own right, but that can't happen at the moment. [[User:Awien|Awien]] ([[User talk:Awien|talk]]) 19:52, 2 August 2013 (UTC)

== 2014? ==

How come there is no info on the recent eruption? It seems to be on the news quite a bit but i can't see any in this article . &lt;span class=nowrap&gt; -- [[User talk:Numbermaniac|&lt;sup style=&quot;font-weight:normal; color:#00E&quot;&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[User:Numbermaniac|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#07E&quot;&gt;numbermaniac&lt;/span&gt;]] [[Special:Contribs/Numbermaniac|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:#00E&quot;&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 10:46, 14 December 2014 (UTC)
 
:You're not a newbie {{u|Numbermaniac}}, you know you can add the info yourself. If you've seen the reports, you basically know what anybody knows: Pahoa is threatened, and could go the way of Kalapana - or not. [[User:Awien|Awien]] ([[User talk:Awien|talk]]) 17:35, 14 December 2014 (UTC)

::Hope I wasn't snappy, {{u|Numbermaniac}}, but if so, I apologise. Just to clarify, what you're calling &quot;the recent eruption&quot; is just one flow of the current eruption that began in 1983 and is ongoing. That's covered in the &quot;1952 to the present&quot; section of the article. I have thought of updating with what's been going on since 2011, but so far it's not actually noteworthy - lava continues to flow, Pahoa is holding its breath, but so far every lobe has stalled before destroying any homes or cutting the road. And for the sake of the people of Puna, long may that continue! Cheers, [[User:Awien|Awien]] ([[User talk:Awien|talk]]) 23:01, 14 December 2014 (UTC)

:::{{u|Numbermaniac}}, thanks to your prod, I did a bit of work and an update re the current eruption. (Also, if you could wave your magic wand over my naked URLs and make them decent, I would be grateful). [[User:Awien|Awien]] ([[User talk:Awien|talk]]) 18:31, 15 December 2014 (UTC)

== Koa'e Fault Zone ==

[[Koa'e Fault Zone]] is an orphan article - looks like someone familiar with this article may be able to find suitable places to de-orphan it. [[User:EdwardLane|EdwardLane]] ([[User talk:EdwardLane|talk]]) 10:14, 13 March 2015 (UTC)</text>
