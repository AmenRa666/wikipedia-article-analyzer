==Brieanne==
Brieanne got hung?? How did I miss that one?? Is it factual?  Also in the Sam section, it implies that Arya killed him too.  Maybe its just worded funny? &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|Reagan]] comment added by ([[User:ReaganWright|ReaganWright]]) 16:16, 26 Jan 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Someone please remove the farcical Brieanne/Sam comment above. Its only purpose is to cause grief to those who haven't finished the book, tantamount to posting &quot;OMG! Hermione dies!!!??!?1&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #f57900;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Tolchocker|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#8f5902;padding-left:1px;&quot;&gt;tolchocker&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User_talk:Tolchocker|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff;background:#fcaf3e;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:03, 1 June 2012 (UTC)

guys, the daenerys chapters referenced to in the third paragraph of the plot summary section didn't appear in A Feast of Crow but WILL appear in A Dance of Dragons--[[User:62.69.116.131|62.69.116.131]] 16:15, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

I've done some rewriting to this section to bring it more in line with the first three books and I felt the five-year-delay info felt a bit out of place at the start of the article. I moved it to the end and heavily rewrote it, as it was of more value before the novel was published now than that it is available. On the other hand, many casual fans may ponder at the reasons for the delay so keeping the information on the page may be of value (and an insight into the writing process). I also added an Awards and Nominations section, although it's still early days for the book. I think it's right that AFFC will only qualify for the 2007 Nebula Awards which won't be held until next year (obviously :) and I don't think the Locus Awards have been announced yet. Fingers crossed for the Hugo Award in a few weeks' time which I think AFFC has a pretty good chance of winning (Accelerando and Spin will give it a damn good run for its money though).--[[User:Werthead|Werthead]] 20:43, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if mentioned on the Amber page, that volumes 6 to 10 are considered worse than the first five books, then i guess it could be mentioned on the page, that this book is a letdown comparing to the first three...

::Well, that would be non-NPOV. Most of the critical reviews of the book we could reference are actually far more positive about the book than the first three, which I don't particularly agree with, but there you go.--[[User:Werthead|Werthead]] 17:43, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

==Littlefinger==
By ''bribing'' one of the lords into insulting him, Littlefinger is able to turn the tables and gets the lords to agree to let him remain Lord Protector of little Lord Robert Arryn for the next year...

As far as I can tell, bribery isn't in it - Littlefinger merely invited the man, and allows his temper to do the work for him. The payment he mentions is later; it is the dowry he intends to pay in order to get his &quot;bastard daughter&quot; wedded to Lord Robert's heir, as he is too young to father any himself and is unlikely to survive long enough to do so. [[User:Daemon8666|Daemon8666]] 06:49, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
:Lyn Corbray was on Littlefinger's payroll. Littlefinger supplies him with boys, among other things. LF admits to Sansa afterwards that their altercation was a pre-planned charade. -[[User:Captain Crawdad|Captain Crawdad]] 18:45, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
::Any chance of a page reference as I don't recall it from teh book and I have just finished it! Thanks. --[[Special:Contributions/194.106.137.50|194.106.137.50]] ([[User talk:194.106.137.50|talk]]) 11:48, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

==Jonny==
Perhaps some of the flowery language could be removed in favor of a more factual entry? As in the plot summary.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/199.44.15.72|199.44.15.72]] ([[User talk:199.44.15.72|talk]]) 16:16, 12 July 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
