Could somebody just write his DOB? [[User:Luka Jačov|Luka Jačov]] 23:36, 10 December 2005 (UTC)

A newspaper article gives his age as 59 in November 2004. So I've given an approximate birth year of 1945 and a link to the article. [[User:Rocksong|Rocksong]] 02:04, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

Well he hasn't aged because the latest newspaper article (January 2006) still has his age as 59. I'll give the link: [http://www.theadvertiser.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,17971639,00.html] but it'll go dead in a week or so. [[User:Rocksong|Rocksong]] 00:09, 30 January 2006 (UTC)


It is premature to merge the two articles in question.  The crimes linked with the murder of Richard Kelvin, and von Einem's conviction of this single crime remain too ambiguous.

== merger of Alan Barnes ==

I've merged the Richard Kelvin article into this as the tag had been there for a long while and have just tagged [[Alan Barnes (murder victim)|Alan Barnes]] for the same treatment. Any objections to the merger ( which'll probably just add a sentence to the article under the &quot;other murders&quot; section ) ? [[User:Peripitus |Peripitus]] [[User talk:Peripitus|(Talk)]] 09:13, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

It seems a little disrespectful that the victims of this man should only be mentioned as a sub section of a page on him.  I think it would be more appropriately handled to mention the names of his victims on the page with links to a seperate pages where the deceased individuals would have a page in their own right IMHO.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Dbr21|Dbr21]] ([[User talk:Dbr21|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dbr21|contribs]]) 12:21, 13 November 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Cause of Richard Kelvin's death ==

'most probably' or 'certainly', but not 'most certainly', please. I suspect it's the former, but because I don't know, I haven't changed it. [[User:Lovingboth|Lovingboth]] ([[User talk:Lovingboth|talk]]) 16:03, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

==A Serial Killer?==
Had von Einem's victims been adult, he would probably be described as a serial killer because they occurred over a long time period and involved the same method of killing. The fact that his victims were children should not alter in any way my opinion that he be described as a serial killer. --[[User:One Salient Oversight|One Salient Oversight]] ([[User talk:One Salient Oversight|talk]]) 04:43, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

== Richard Dallas Kelvin  ==

All the way through this article Richard Kelvin is referred to as Kelvin. I think this does the boy a disservice and I am going to change all the references to him to either Richard or Richard Kelvin. The boy is a victim and referring to him by just his surname is very impersonal. [[User:SpencerCollins|SpencerCollins]] ([[User talk:SpencerCollins|talk]]) 08:52, 19 October 2010 (UTC)

: Agreed, but I think you should change it to 'Richie' instead, or maybe 'Ol' Richie Boy,' makes it sound even more personal-like. --[[User:Breshkovsky|Breshkovsky]] ([[User talk:Breshkovsky|talk]]) 22:06, 25 November 2010 (UTC)

== The Case ==

&quot;his immediate reaction was to say that he wouldn't answer anything without speaking to his lawyer first.&quot;
This is what any sane person should do in any case.
Let alone the fact einem knew him from previous prostitution they had engaged in.
Then passing him on to another who murdered him quite possibly.

If you are going to lie and try cover for a murderer he deserves to be in prision anyway.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/27.33.107.88|27.33.107.88]] ([[User talk:27.33.107.88|talk]]) 10:06, 2 February 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
