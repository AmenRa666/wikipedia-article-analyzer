== Too In-Universe ==

This article is pretty well-written, but has a huge flaw: It's almost entirely in-universe. No information is given on, say, players' reactions to the Nemesis, pop-culture references to the Nemesis, and so on.

== Resident evil Apocalypse ==

I think there should be a bit more on his appearence in the film. I started writing up some info but i lack the ability to write in  &quot;the formal tone expected of an encyclopedia entry&quot;.
This is all i got&gt;

At the end of [[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]] the character (Matt) was taken by umbrella scientist and told that he would be used in the 'Nemesis' program. In the sequel [[2004 in film|2004 film]] [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]] Nemesis makes his appearence.
The film does have a similarity to the game, whereby nemesis is still on a search and destroy mission in racoon city as well as being tested by umbrella against 'Alice' (played by [[Milla Jovovich|Milla Jovovich]])


In the film his appearence has not changed but there are some considerable differences when compared with the game. Instead of just wielding a rocket launcher he also carries a Minigun. It is also apparent in the film that he is under direct control from umbrella as he recieves an order to kill all S.T.A.R.S. members. His vision is similar to that of [[The Terminator|The Terminator]], which displays information such as Directives, Functionality, Threat Assessment and Ammunition remaining.

== Continuity problem? ==

:''Through the course of Resident Evil 3 Nemesis managed to kill just one S.T.A.R.S member; the aforementioned Brad Vickers. Brad's corpse reanimates and he can be seen as an unusually strong zombie in Resident Evil 2''

If Brad is killed in RE3, how is he a reanimated corpse in RE2? --[[User:Fxer|Fxer]] 17:22, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

*Because RE3 occurs more or less concurrently with RE2.  That is to say, Brad's death occurs ''before'' he is encountered by Claire or Leon.

There is still a continuity error, though.  He was killed with a tentacle through the head.  That should prevent him from becoming a zombie.  Hmm...  [[User:Teflon Don|Teflon Don]] 19:39, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

There is a probability that the tentacle did not hit vital parts of the brain that controls movement. Brad in RE2 is tougher than the average zombie maybe because he is wearing a bullet proof vest. Although the virus that came from Nemesis can be also a factor.

If a person takes any kind of major damage to its head (such as oh say a tenticle going straight through it) then they cannot come back as a zombie.  I belive Brad was more or less just ment to be a fun little cameo alluding to RE 3 and nothing more.  Especially since hes a secret zombie and hel only appear on normal mode in A scenario if you make it to the police station without picking up a single item.--[[User:NobleServent2|NobleServent2]] 02:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)NobleServent2

== VGCats ==

Is the VGCats section really necessary? I mean, VGCats is awesome and all, but the link doesn't really contribute to the article whatsoever. [[User:Natas347|Natas347]] 19:22, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

How about we change it to trivia or Nemesis in Popular culture and stick in his appearance in Penny arcade as well. [[User:Jargon|Jargon]] 06:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== Inconsistencies ==
Extreme inaccuracies in description: the whole &quot;developement&quot; section is full of errors. I suggest someone take care and read through &quot;Wesker´s Report 2&quot;- it is stated clearly there that the test involving Lisa and the NE-a parasite was NOT deemed a success: the parasite simply disappeared. 

The initial G-virus was actually &quot;discovered&quot; inside Lisa sometime after this by Birkin.

Also, Wesker had nothing to do with the developement of the G-virus. It was Birkin´s lifework, and far beyond Wesker´s abilities as a scientist.

: According to the ''Wekser Report 2'', Wesker claims Birkin showed little interest towards the &quot;Nemesis Specimen&quot;, thus allowing Wesker to spearhead the project. Next, Wesker had to beg Spencer to allow him to mess around with the Specimen, while Birkin objected to the entire idea. 

:As for Lisa, The ''Wesker Report 2'' states the parasite did in fact vanish when it entered Lisa's mind, but later reappeared some time later. Leading to the start of the [[G-Virus]] project, which was spearheaded by Birkin. --[[User:ShadowJester07|ShadowJester07]] 19:43, 27 August 2006 (UTC)


Small note: I sped through the article and noticed someone had overlooked spaces and typos in the lower section of the article, so I took my time to correct them. [[User:White Mage Cid|White Mage Cid]] 19:28, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

== Should Nemesis be in the &quot;Fictional Undead&quot; category? ==

After all he's (she? It?) technically a mutated creature (presumably human) and was never dead at any point as far as we know? - [[User:Bisected8|Bisected8]] 11:58, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
:I believe all RE creatures, ei &quot;Zombies&quot;, Lickers, and Cerberus Dogs, are all mutants. And if &quot;it&quot; was never dead at any point, would not it be still alive?&quot; ;) --[[User:ShadowJester07|ShadowJester07]] 00:46, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

== Identity ==

Anyone know nemesis' true identity,who he was? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/84.43.29.130|84.43.29.130]] ([[User talk:84.43.29.130|talk]]) 01:03, 20 March 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

:I'm not sure who he truly was in ''RE3'', but in the movie, he was originally Matt Addison. I believe Umbrella captures test subjects for their Tyrant expierments, like [[Lisa Trevor]], so its likely he was originally an innocent person before becoming Nemesis in ''RE3''. I'm not 100% sure though. --&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border: 1px solid&quot;&gt;[[user:ShadowJester07|'''&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:White; color:#003333&quot;&gt; &amp;nbsp;ShadowJester07&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;''']][[User talk:ShadowJester07|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#00004d; color:#FF4F00&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;►Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 01:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

Cool thanks. \m/-_-\m/  I knew who he was in the film,I looked on the net but there's no sites that say who he was(in the game). Oh well.

Actually he's one of 10 clones of Sergei Vladimir.[[User:Bryanoftoons|Bryanoftoons]] ([[User talk:Bryanoftoons|talk]]) 15:44, 11 March 2008 (UTC)

== A-Class review ==

Don't really have much to criticize in this article.  Only thing sI got is that if you take it to FA their going to question your use of MoviesOnline- i.e., what makes them an RS? and that the first sentence of the literature section should be something like &quot;adaptation of ''Resident Evil 3'' by Lee Chung Hing, ''Biohazard 3: Last Escape'', which is named after the game's Japanese title.&quot; The &quot;which is&quot; clause right now is dangling. --'''[[User:PresN|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Pres&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:PresN|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;]]''' 17:56, 17 April 2009 (UTC)
:Replaced MoviesOnline with a valid ref used later in the article, and fixed the part of In literature per recommendation.--[[User:Kung Fu Man|Kung Fu Man]] ([[User talk:Kung Fu Man|talk]]) 22:25, 17 April 2009 (UTC)

Some prose issues are the main things that popped out at me.
*&quot;In the lead: ''...the Resident Evil series of video games.''&quot; → &quot;''...the Resident Evil franchise.''&quot;
**The character appears in different media.
*The second sentence of &quot;In video games&quot; is a run-on.
*&quot;In literature&quot; → &quot;In printed adaptations&quot;
**I don't know if I'd count comics as literature. I remember we did the same thing for the [[List of Kingdom Hearts media]] and the other articles (see [[Talk:List of Kingdom Hearts media#Merging Kingdom Hearts Trading Card Game|discussion]]).
*I know this is a style preference up for debate, but I'd like to see fewer lengthy quotes in the reception section
**Also, the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; in GameDaily's quote should be in italcis.
*What makes GameCritics.com and [[N-Europe]] reliable sources?
*Should &quot;''Top 10 Video Game Villains article''&quot; be &quot;''Top 10 Video Game Villains feature''&quot;?
*I question whether [[:File:Nemesis-RE3.jpg]] should be in the article. I know [[:File:Nemesis0.png]] doesn't show much detail, especially the face, but I think [[:File:Biohazard3-comic-Nemesis.jpg]] fills in the blanks just as well and is a better image for the weapon. 
Overall the article is in good shape, and I will gladly support after the issues above are addressed. ([[User:Guyinblack25|Guyinblack25]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Guyinblack25|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:15, 29 April 2009 (UTC))
