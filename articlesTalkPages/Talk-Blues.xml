== Article title ==

I've reverted the move by [[User:SilkTork]] to change this article name to &quot;The blues&quot;, which in my view is a major step which requires discussion and community consensus here first.  I'm not ''necessarily'' against the move, but am ''strongly'' in favour of the need for it to be discussed here first.  Having said that, I'm personally going to be off-site for a couple of days, and look forward to joining the debate on my return.  [[User:Ghmyrtle|Ghmyrtle]] ([[User talk:Ghmyrtle|talk]]) 17:29, 31 December 2010 (UTC)

:I've restored to the correct use of the term as the reason given for reverting is not neccessary. See [[Wikipedia:Don't revert due to &quot;no consensus&quot;]], and also [[Wikipedia:Reverting]]. [http://www.google.com/search?q=the+blues&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a#q=the+blues&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wp&amp;fp=fc8aae4abccfd483 The blues] is the form that appears to be widely used when discussing the blues. I did a little research before making the move, and I also checked back in the archives to see if this had previously been discussed. It looks to me as though &quot;blues&quot; has been used as the title incorrectly, and others reading the article have simply assumed that the person naming it &quot;blues&quot; did so because there was a valid reason which they didn't know about. If there are valid reasons for calling it &quot;blues&quot; then it would be worth presenting them so a discussion can take place. &lt;span style=&quot;border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;&quot;&gt;'''[[User:SilkTork|&lt;font face=&quot;Script MT&quot; color=&quot;#1111AA&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;SilkTork&lt;/font&gt;]]''' *[[User talk:SilkTork|&lt;sup&gt;YES!&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:05, 31 December 2010 (UTC)

[[The blues]] → {{no redirect|1=Blues}} — So far as I am aware, this page has been located at &quot;Blues&quot; since it was created in 2001, until the last few days.  Again, so far as I am aware, there has been no dispute, objection or discussion about that title.  However, on 31 December, [[User:SilkTork]] moved the article, without any prior discussion, to &quot;The blues&quot;, in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_blues&amp;diff=405181376&amp;oldid=404217978 this edit].  After I reverted [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_blues&amp;diff=405189421&amp;oldid=405182325 here], the article was moved back to &quot;The blues&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_blues&amp;diff=405192729&amp;oldid=405191133 here].  

The current article title &quot;The blues&quot; is unjustified on several counts.  Firstly, the title &quot;Blues&quot; is long-established and has been uncontested.  [[WP:TITLECHANGES]] states: ''&quot;If an article title has been stable for a long time, and there is no good reason to change it, it should not be changed.&quot;''  Secondly, the title &quot;The blues&quot; contravenes [[WP:TITLE]] in several respects.  It is not the term ''&quot;that readers are most likely to look for in order to find the article&quot;''.  It is not concise.  Guidance at [[WP:DEFINITE]] states: ''&quot;Avoid definite and indefinite articles: Do not place definite or indefinite articles (the, a and an) at the beginning of titles unless they are part of a proper name...or will otherwise change the meaning...&quot;'' - neither of which applies.  In terms of general usage, although the term &quot;The blues&quot; (or &quot;The Blues&quot;) is a widely used term, there is no evidence at all that it is any more widely used than the term &quot;Blues&quot; (or, for example, &quot;Blues music&quot;).  For all these reasons, the article should have its long-established title, &quot;Blues&quot;, reinstated.  [[User:Ghmyrtle|Ghmyrtle]] ([[User talk:Ghmyrtle|talk]]) 19:12, 2 January 2011 (UTC)

[[Blues]] → {{no redirect|1=Blues music}} —
I'm afraid the first discussion was too quick for me. I wasn't able to take part and give my views. Rationale for naming the article '''Blues music'''.

*[http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=the+blues&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a#q=the+blues&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wp&amp;fp=1&amp;cad=b The blues] appears to be the standard form for naming and discussing this topic. A blues singer would say &quot;I sing the blues&quot; rather than &quot;I sing blues&quot;. The definite article is dropped when it is replaced by a descriptor, such as &quot;Chicago&quot; blues, or by the indefinite article, such as &quot;a&quot; blues singer. When linked to &quot;music&quot;, it becomes &quot;blues music&quot;, and is acceptable in that form. However the form &quot;blues&quot; does not often appear by itself. The form &quot;the blues&quot; falls into the same category as [[The Crown]], which is indicated in [[WP:NOUN]]. I came to this article because of an awkward link construction on another article where someone had written &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;[[blues|the blues]]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. However, because [[WP:NOUN]] frowns upon the use of the definite article, and there is uncertainty about using it in this article an alternative is [[Blues music]]. [[Blues music]] would be more descriptive, and avoid the possible conflict over the Wikipedia reluctance to use the definite article. We already have [[Rock music]], [[Pop music]], [[Soul music]], [[Swing music]], [[Folk music]], etc. There are examples of music form articles which do stand alone, such as [[Jazz]] and [[Reggae]], though with these examples there is no risk of confusion or conflict. I will notify significant contributors and WikiProjects of this discussion, and request that it is not closed for at least seven days, to allow a consensus to be built up. &lt;span style=&quot;border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;&quot;&gt;'''[[User:SilkTork|&lt;font face=&quot;Script MT&quot; color=&quot;#1111AA&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;SilkTork&lt;/font&gt;]]''' *[[User talk:SilkTork|&lt;sup&gt;YES!&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:51, 3 January 2011 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' move. Firstly, &quot;(the) blues&quot; is much more common than &quot;blues music&quot; and this article is the clear primary topic for &quot;blues&quot;. The situation is different from, for example, &quot;rock music&quot; because rock music is not considered to be the primary topic for [[rock]] (which is a disambiguation page) and has to be disambiguated from the other meanings somehow anyway. Secondly, [[WP:THE]] specifies that we only start a page title with the definite article if the article is habitually capitalized in running text. This is not the case here, which is why we use [[blues]] and not [[the blues]]. [[User:Jafeluv|Jafeluv]] ([[User talk:Jafeluv|talk]]) 13:11, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''; proposed title is overly precise.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:LtPowers|T]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:34, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Neutral''' on &quot;Blues&quot; vs. &quot;Blues music&quot;, as either could work ok and I'm not averse to consistency of naming with other styles of music. Since the above rationale includes a lot about &quot;Blues&quot; vs &quot;The blues&quot;, I'll also say I '''oppose''' the version with the unnecessary definite article (and would also regard the &quot;I play blues&quot; sentence as perfectly normal). [[User:AllyD|AllyD]] ([[User talk:AllyD|talk]]) 16:23, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Support''', or move to [[Blues (music)]]. To many people &quot;blues&quot; or The blues&quot; (ignoring case of letters) first means depression, or some Army unit or football club, etc: see [[Blues (disambiguation)]]. Let the plain name be the disambig page. [[User:Anthony Appleyard|Anthony Appleyard]] ([[User talk:Anthony Appleyard|talk]]) 16:37, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' no need to move it per above. You named this examples:

:*[[Rock music]], [[Pop music]], [[Soul music]], [[Swing music]], [[Folk music]]
::they have all the &quot;music&quot; after the genre, without it would define the first word.
:*Rock, Pop, Soul, Swing, Folk

:According to Google, the term &quot;Blues&quot; has more results:
::Blues: &lt;s&gt;''157,000,000''&lt;/s&gt;''130.000.000''(searched &quot;Blues&quot; instead of Blues)
::Blues music: ''111,000,000''--&lt;span style=&quot;color:#A4D3EE; background-color:#E0EEEE;font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'&quot;&gt; [[User:GreatOrangePumpkin|♫Greatorangepumpkin♫]] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:Black; background-color:#A4D3EE;font-family: 'Gigi'&quot;&gt;[[User talk:GreatOrangePumpkin|T]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:16, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
:::Not surprising.  How many of those 157 million are about music?  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:LtPowers|T]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
 
::A Google search for &quot;blues&quot; turns up [http://www.cardiffblues.com/], [http://www.bcfc.com/page/Welcome], [http://www.bluestheskishop.co.uk/], [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1343700/Barnsley-2-Coventry-1-Lovre-brushes-Sky-Blues-away-lift-Tykes.html?ito=feeds-newsxml], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2011/jan/03/obama-democrats-republicans-spending-cuts], and [http://www.smh.com.au/sport/football/villas-lastgasp-equaliser-a-new-blow-to-blues-title-hopes-20110103-19dvs.html] on the first page of results. &quot;Blues&quot; is a well used term, which can imply being depressed, or a sports team who wear blue, or a number of other things. At one time it was a common name for [[Depressant|downers]], and some animals and insects are referred to as blues. So a Google search just for &quot;blues&quot; would be including a bunch of things that are not &quot;blues music&quot;. It's likely the 46,000,000 extra results for &quot;blues&quot; over &quot;blues music&quot; would be the other things. &lt;span style=&quot;border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;&quot;&gt;'''[[User:SilkTork|&lt;font face=&quot;Script MT&quot; color=&quot;#1111AA&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;SilkTork&lt;/font&gt;]]''' *[[User talk:SilkTork|&lt;sup&gt;YES!&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:26, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Support''' to be consistent with [[Rock music]], [[Pop music]], [[Soul music]], [[Swing music]], [[Folk music]].--[[User:TonyTheTiger|TonyTheTiger]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:TonyTheTiger|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger|C]]/[[User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon|BIO]]/[[WP:CHICAGO]]/[[WP:FOUR]]) &lt;/small&gt; 20:01, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
*:Consistency among similar articles of course plays a role in determining the article's title, but the situation is a little different here. The titles you list are all disambiguated because the music genre has not been determined as the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|primary topic]] of [[rock]], [[pop]], [[soul]], [[swing]] and [[folk]]. If the proposal is to keep [[blues]] redirecting to this page as well, it makes no sense to use a disambiguated title. That is, unless you're saying that the music genre is ''more commonly'' referred to as &quot;blues music&quot; than just blues. Note also how [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[gospel]] etc. use non-disambiguated titles. [[User:Jafeluv|Jafeluv]] ([[User talk:Jafeluv|talk]]) 20:25, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' blues is definitely the most common use of the word. The above examples have music in the title because they have other definitions outside of music. Blues is rarely used outside of music. Most people would look up &quot;Sad&quot; or &quot;Sadness&quot; if they wanted the other definition. [[User:JDDJS|JDDJS]] ([[User talk:JDDJS|talk]]) 20:16, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Weak oppose'''. If I had to choose one choice, I would probably choose what is being served currently. I probably wouldn't mind if it changed to &quot;blues music&quot;, but I like it simply as &quot;blues&quot; because it is more commonly used than &quot;blues music&quot;. [[User:Backtable|&lt;font color = &quot;green&quot;&gt;Backtable &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Backtable|&lt;font color = &quot;brown&quot;&gt;Speak to me&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Backtable|&lt;font color = &quot;gray&quot;&gt;concerning my deeds.&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:33, 4 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''.  &quot;Blues&quot; (without definite article) is a very widely and commonly used term, and there is no good reason to depart from established practice and guidance here.  If there were very strong reasons, I would not necessarily oppose either &quot;Blues music&quot; or &quot;Blues (music)&quot; - but none of the arguments made so far have convinced me that such a move is either necessary or helpful.  I remain opposed to naming the article &quot;The blues&quot; for reasons already stated.  I also agree with the points made by [[User:Jafeluv]], in particular.  [[User:Ghmyrtle|Ghmyrtle]] ([[User talk:Ghmyrtle|talk]]) 09:06, 4 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. I see both sides of this one, remembering that the first time I tried to find the blues on Wikipedia I included the definite article. However, a search on google books reveals that there are a very large number of important titles that simply use the form &quot;blues&quot;. Therefore I think the move is unecessary. If a move were demonstrated to be necessary I would probably prefer &quot;the blues&quot; to &quot;blues music&quot;, but both would be accurate and I could see myself joining a consensus around them.--'''&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Black Chancery;text:grey 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;[[User:Sabrebd|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;SabreBD&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Sabrebd|talk&lt;/span&gt;]]) 09:20, 4 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. It's like &quot;[[Rock and roll]]&quot;. You'd sure hear some calling it &quot;Rock and roll music&quot;, but the common usage is &quot;Rock and roll&quot;. Same as &quot;[[Blues]]&quot;. Common usage is &quot;Blues&quot;. No need to change the title. ~ [[User:Elitropia|Elitropia]] ([[User talk:Elitropia|talk]]) 09:48, 4 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. When musicians say &quot;I have the blues&quot; it means &quot;I have the blue devils on my mind&quot;, i.e. &quot;I am sad&quot;.  That's why blues usually appears with the &quot;the&quot; in front of it.  I also support the idea that Blues music or Blues (music) is too specific.  I think evereybody understand that the first meaning of blues is a music genre and not a plural form. [[User:Vb|Vb]] ([[User talk:Vb|talk]]) 18:51, 6 January 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. &quot;Blues&quot; is just fine.  When people see &quot;blues,&quot; they automatically think music -- not colors, or mood, or anything else.  &quot;Blues music&quot; reads as a redundancy.  A disambiguation page will solve any problem with perceived lack of specificity for those few who may be confused.  Further, when Black folk talk about &quot;singing the blues,&quot; they're talking about being down -- not actually ''singing'' the blues.  When B.B. King sings &quot;Why I sing the blues,&quot; that's rather a lyrical accommodation to meter, rather than the way Black folks talk.  If I'm referring to a blues artist, I'll say, &quot;He/She sings blues&quot; -- not &quot;''the'' blues.&quot;  Or, I'll say, &quot;He called me, singin' the blues about his supervisor bein' on his back all the time.&quot;  He's not actually ''singing''; he's complaining, or sad/down-in-the-mouth ABOUT something. It strikes me that this discussion is somewhat ethnically skewed as well; that is, people are responding based on their own culturally mediated experiences -- as am I, to a certain extent.  I mean Brit David Bowie's song about &quot;danc[ing] the blues&quot;?  The lyrics are just jarringly strange to me.  ''No one'' Black talks of &quot;dancing the blues&quot; -- and I'm not sure many native-born U.S. citizens of any ethnicity do either.

== Blues Jam ==

Blues is mostly based on improvisation. That opens up for new musical meetings at ''&quot;jam sessions&quot;''. At a jam session, the musicians get together and play with people they have not met before. This is an important element for blues music and its circulation of influences.

'''Here is an example of fine improvisation at a jam session.'''

I know „to be blue“ or „to have the blues“ like &quot;to be sad&quot;  and I believe, blues was in origin a [[Lament]] of people in [[Slavery in the United States]]. They had enough reasons to be sad,  fate of slavery, deprived oh their liberty, rapes, corporal punishment, forced disconnection of families, …

== New Lead ==

User [[User:OnBeyondZebrax|OnBeyondZebrax]] changed the lead paragraph to a very long one with plenty of details which I think are not relevant to the common reader.  For instance &quot;The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908: Antonio Maggio's &quot;I Got the Blues&quot; is the first published song to use the word blues.&quot; is not an information which is worth telling at this place.  The same is IMHO true for &quot;There are few characteristics common to all blues music, because the genre took its shape from the idiosyncrasies of individual performances.&quot;  I think such a major change to the article should be discussed here before being implemented. I shall reverse those changes in a near future if no opposite opinion were to be expressed.  [[User:Vbrems|Vbrems]] ([[User talk:Vbrems|talk]]) 15:12, 18 September 2014 (UTC)
:Reverse what changes?  All of them??  The changes made by OnBeyondZebrax represented a big improvement on what was there previously, making it more informative and more in line with general WP practice on introductory sections.  I'm happy with at least 90% of the current version, though like you I think that the Maggio reference is far too obscure and tangential to be mentioned in the lead.  But, all it needs is a bit of tweaking, not a total reversion to the earlier inadequate version.  [[User:Ghmyrtle|Ghmyrtle]] ([[User talk:Ghmyrtle|talk]]) 21:06, 18 September 2014 (UTC)

Influential in its development were the collective unaccompanied work-songs of the plantation culture, which followed a responsorial 'leader-and-chorus' form that can be traced not only to pre-Civil War origins but to African sources. Responsorial work-songs diminished when the plantations were broken up, but persisted in the southern penitentiary farms until the 1950s. After the Reconstruction era, black workers either engaged in seasonal collective labour in the South or tended smallholdings leased to them under the system of debt-serfdom known as sharecropping. Work-songs therefore increasingly took the form of solo calls or 'hollers', comparatively free in form but close to blues in feeling. The vocal style of the blues probably derived from the holler... Blues instrumental style shows tenuous links with African music. Drumming was forbidden on slave plantations, but the playing of string instruments was often permitted and even encouraged, so the musicians among slaves from the savanna regions, with their strong traditions of string playing, predominated. The ''jelli'', or ''[[griot]]s'' – professional musicians who also acted as their tribe’s historians and social commentators – performed roles not unlike those of the later blues singers, while the [[banjo]] is thought to be a direct descendant of their ''[[banza]]'' or ''[[xalam]]''.| accessdate=3 October 2015}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;), to avoid the potential for very real misunderstandings.

:[http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&amp;artid=410 Here's a different source]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The musical influences of the early blues are not solely African-American. Slave culture did not grow in a vacuum devoid of Western societal influence. The slave owner’s traditions segued into the past African and African-American stimuli to change the musical technique distinctly. All Western European ethnicities in the New World influenced the emerging genre’s style.

The first blues used the guitar, an instrument Spanish in origin and, perhaps, introduced into the Delta by Mexican and Italian immigrants during the late 1890s. Spanish/Latino song practices came into serious involvement with the instrumentation of the first blues. Tenant housing on Dockery Plantation between Ruleville and Cleveland, Mississippi boasted this ethnic mixture during the beginning of the twentieth century. The guitar perfectly suited the rural musician in an accompaniment capacity. Its small size and weight allowed mobility, while at the same time having a large and varied tonal range for different performance styles. The flexible rhythmic qualities of the guitar allowed the musician to add emotion and dramatics to each different song when warranted. The 6 and 12 string arrangement of the instrument allowed for variable tunings. A popular tuning was the &quot;Spanish&quot; tuning (D-G-D-G-B-D) or open A. This tuning was primarily used for slide guitar compositions. This tuning is similar to a standard banjo tuning, so adaptation from one instrument to the other was easily learned. The tonal composition was more fluid and orchestral than a standard E tuning. This allowed for a fuller, extra textural sound during performance.

Anglo-European influence can also be seen in the surfacing of the Delta Blues.

The first popular African-American musicians were trained to play classical European music. Waltzes appear in most accounts of minstrel shows. European folk tunes and hymns from the British Isles found their way into black music in such songs as &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, &quot;Lord Randall&quot;, and &quot; The Golden Vanity&quot;. The nuances of the folk tunes would mix with whatever ethnicity was predominant in the region. Caucasian country music would arise from these in some areas while zones with Afro-American majorities started the blues. The musicians’ methodology was much less segregated than conventional society, with genre styles intermingling with one another freely.

Charlie Patton, and subsequently country artists like Jimmie Rogers and Hank Williams, held no constriction to a genre mentally, just in playing capability. Patton’s &quot;Going To Move To Alabama&quot;, is a prime example of this integration. The song is the basic blues form, but the fiddle accompaniment adds the distinct sound of a white country song. Hank Williams’s &quot;Move It on Over&quot; is an almost blatant copy of Patton’s song.

The structure of most ballads was almost identical to that of early blues, with the AAB form, and differed in the minstrel type in that the blues concerned bawdier, less publicly performed subjects. The Anglo-European style was already apparent in most minstrelsy, so picking up on the structure was relatively easy for most blues musicians. The subject matter dealt with in ballads is also echoed in the blues. Ballads dealt with themes of love, locations, people, and events. The ballad almost always took the narrative form, relying on the iconography of the subject matter to help produce greater imagery in the song.

The main division between African-American and Caucasian styles of balladry is the degree to which the topic matter was taken. The &quot;black&quot; ballad venerated outlaws, tricksters, and folk heroes its &quot;white&quot; relative would never touch, and at a much faster, call and response oriented rhythm. Figures such as John Henry, Long Jim or John, Stackolee, and the Grey Goose permeated the storylines of most of these songs. &quot;John Henry&quot;, the black railroad worker who wins the Pyrrhic victory over the steam engine and consequently dies, represents the conflict between white and black, and even the fight against industrialization. &quot;John Henry&quot;-type songs were performed in minstrelsy, but not with the same character content shown in this type of ballad. The occupation of John Henry could be changed to fit any form of work the African-American was engaged in. &quot;Long John&quot; or &quot;Long Jim&quot; were aphorisms for the downtrodden worker or prisoner who rebelled against his master successfully. &quot;Stackolee&quot; or Stagger Lee was a &quot;bad nigger&quot; who completely disregarded the society that held him captive and murdered or committed violence against others. &quot;Stackolee&quot; is so unstoppable that in some versions he dies and then battles the devil in Hell and wins. The &quot;Grey Goose&quot; was a sign for indestructibility and defiance in the face of an almost insurmountable enemy. The goose is shot, skinned, and eaten, but is seen once again flying over its killers.

These influences melded the Western with the African, and changed music forever. The infiltration of the European styles into the Afro-American cultural lexicon produced an inherently new and distinct genre. The drawing from these different roots would make the blues startlingly new, but with historically recognizable oral, social, and ethnic themes. The European styles picked up by the musicians would be the final ingredient to the emergence of the early &quot;Downhome&quot; blues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
