== Driving a privilege or a right? ==

My understanding is that the driver's license in the US was not always required and driving was a right and not a privilege.  This stands up to reason when you consider that the mode of transportation being replaced was the horse, horse driven buggy, or oxen and wagon.  None of these required a license or had age restrictions.  Driving animals was common place and the motorized vehicle was considered unusual.  Before I left my hometown in 1971, there was a law still on the books that required drivers of automobiles to call ahead to the town constable. Ostensibly this was so he could warn the horse owners in the city that a motor vehicle was coming into town.

I would like to know exactly how the concept of licensing drivers came about and became accepted in everyday life.

Why didn't the same thing happen with aircraft and boating licenses?

::Driving is a right not a privilege, at least in the UK it is - although some politicians seem to think the opposite. I've changed the word ''grant'' [a licence] to ''issue''. ''Grant'' implies it's a privilege. [[User:Arcturus|Arcturus]] 18:25, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

::: In the United States the operation of a vehicle is treated as a privilege granted by the state that is revocable at any time.  For example, California Vehicle Code Section 14607.4 begins as follows: &quot;The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (a) Driving a motor vehicle on the public streets and highways is a privilege, not a right.&quot; Numerous sections of the California Vehicle Code refer to the &quot;privilege of operating a motor vehicle&quot; &amp;mdash; just run a Google search.  --[[User:Coolcaesar|Coolcaesar]] 02:27, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

:::: For a country that prides itself on being ''the'' beacon of democracy in the world, and yet believes that the state grants privileges to the people, is absolutely amazing. Surely it's the other way round. Still, I obviously can't argue with the facts of US law. In the UK, driving certainly isn't defined as a privilege - so far as I know, but as I alluded to earlier, there are plenty of bumptious politicians and other assorted bureaucrats who consider it so. I think the term ''issue licence'' covers all eventualities. [[User:Arcturus|Arcturus]] 12:49, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

Well, although the US law identifies driving as a privilege, now a days it is really treated as a right although, it is a privilege that may still be revoked for reasons. [[User:Cooldoug111|Mac Domhnaill]] 01:19, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

:When I was reading the book on Vehicle Traffic Law (which I added a cite for to the [[MUTCD]] article) there was some explanation of this.  If I recall correctly, the reason for why it is treated as a privilege is due to some early legal decisions treating gasoline-powered automobiles as a public nuisance because they were noisy and extremely dangerous.  Because states have plenary power to ban public nuisances, the courts reasoned that they could also ban automobiles if they wished.  In turn, automobiles are allowed to operate on the roads only at the pleasure of the state.  That's how we got from the original concept of the right of driving a wagon or stagecoach or riding a horse, etc. to the modern idea of the privilege of operating a motor vehicle.  I forgot to write down the page numbers for that section, though.  --[[User:Coolcaesar|Coolcaesar]] 19:41, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

::Driving a car on your own property is a right, hence the reason that a driver's license is not required to drive on your own land (though allowing a small child to do so would probably be considered endangerment). Driving on public roads is generally legally considered a privilege, which is why you need a license (that can be revoked). --[[User:SodiumBenzoate|SodiumBenzoate]] 09:15, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

:This should be mentioned in article, some of this stuff. Also, this article should be expanded to explain whether people who refuse to learn to drive, or never get around to it simply have no viable means of identification. It says that the US has no public ID, but if this is the case, then driving isn't really a right or privilege but something expected or else one becomes an outcast. It also follows that it must be a right, because without which you would be able to give up your license (in the face of rising gas prices, for instance).

Technically, you are not &quot;driving&quot; per se unless you are involved in &quot;carriage&quot;, you are moving. Yet we use the term &quot;driving&quot; as we do say &quot;zerox&quot; me a copy when in fact you are not using a &quot;zerox&quot;. The law does not use language saying you are &quot;driving&quot; a passenger automobile or station wagon. &quot;Driving&quot; or &quot;operating&quot; refers to commercial conduct in the law as &quot;register&quot; refers to surrender. &quot;Vehicle&quot; means Vessel or auxiliary of and has its roots in customs. Your STATE vehicle laws originate from usc title 49 and are not laws but regulations respecting commerce. So who actually &quot;requires&quot; a driver license or registration? Your insurance company. Since insurance is a maritime contract they require a maritime nexus. In CARGILL it is ruled that a license will impose no obligation if a right is to be surrendered. Nevertheless, the state dmv will be happy to accommodate you, and that is mandated by title 49.

:Sounds like the above editor either never studied or flunked U.S. constitutional law.  The states are still sovereign pursuant to the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  The federal government exerts some jurisdiction through [[Spending Clause]] tactics like tying federal aid for highways to compliance with federal standards, but a state can always theoretically break away from the federal transportation regs.  It just has to fund its highway system on its own, that's all.  --[[User:Coolcaesar|Coolcaesar]] ([[User talk:Coolcaesar|talk]]) 11:03, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

::Also, the above editor is incorrect about insurance being a maritime contract and requiring a maritime nexus.  I am educated in law and a licensed insurance agent in 49 states, and SOME insurance coverage is marine based, but much is not.  Inland marine coverage is to insure property being transported - that does not mean that auto, homeowners, or umbrella coverage is a marine based coverage.  Also, insurance companies do not require licenses - the law does.  Insurance companies would insure absent a driver's license if state law allowed such.[[Special:Contributions/12.109.73.226|12.109.73.226]] ([[User talk:12.109.73.226|talk]]) 18:52, 9 January 2009 (UTC) -Subjugator

=== Legal foundation for Driving a privilege  ===
The concept of a &quot;democracy&quot; is a self-governing people. The government isn't some abstract entity, it is the just all the other people in your country. The 13 colonies, in passing the Constitution, established a process of government, which allows the individual to live largely free of other's anti-social behavior. The law defines anti-social behavior. When the automobile came along in the 1900s, the anti-social behavior that arose was leaving the scene of an accident in order to evade responsibility (accountability for damages). Auto accidents brought new types of serious injuries (blindness from shattering glass shards). Driver's licensing grew out of frustration with anonymity on the road, and its undermining of accountability. Would you like to drive in a world where other's could victimize you and your loved ones on the road, without any accountability? Without being able to be identified? On balance, the great majority would rather have accountability than some libertarian distopia where individuals are free to do whatever they want. They want the group to have some reasonable level of control over the individual. Looked at this way, driving an automobile makes sense to treat as a privilege with certain responsibilities toward the welfare of others. If driving were a right (as in &quot;inalienable&quot;), there would be no legal basis for placing driving restrictions on the blind, the severely retarded, those with advanced Alzheimers, 5 year olds, or chronic drunks. Even after a drunk had killed several motorists, what would be the legal basis for taking away driving, if driving were a right?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:PbinCA|PbinCA]] ([[User talk:PbinCA|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/PbinCA|contribs]]) 04:22, 21 March 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

In every country that uses English as an official language the term used is Driver's Licence or Driver Licence. Only in the USA is the word &quot;License&quot; used. On that note Wiki certainly is demonstrating a non global position by continuing to use the word &quot;license&quot; as the primary format on this page. Even the Bangladesh licence you show as an example has it spelled the universal (non US) manner.   &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Aamvanet|Aamvanet]] ([[User talk:Aamvanet|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Aamvanet|contribs]]) 15:43, 5 April 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Driver's License vs Driver License vs Drivers License ==
Just about every state uses the term &quot;Driver License&quot; on that actual license itself. Do a Google image search for verification. Is &quot;Driver License&quot; grammatically correct? Some states do use &quot;Driver's License,&quot; but the majority seem to use &quot;Driver License.&quot; Which is right?

Many states use Drivers License.  I prefer that for simplification.  Otherwise you get into whether it should be driver's or drivers' license.[[User:Thoralor|Thoralor]] ([[User talk:Thoralor|talk]]) 09:42, 22 February 2016 (UTC)

:I am making an assumption here, but by &quot;State&quot; I assume you mean a state in the USA. The term Driver's License or Drivers licence is used across the English speaking world and not just in the States and it would need a much more comprehensive survey of usage across the world to determine which of the two versions is correct. The term '''Driver's license''' would seem to be more logically correct indicating that it was the driver who owned or deserved the license. '''Driver licence''' seems a little odd grammatically but there are , no doubt, good reasons for its use. Oh, and I think this has been discussed before  - see above and above that and above that etc.  &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:lightblue&quot;&gt;'''''&amp;nbsp;[[User:Velella|Velella]]&amp;nbsp;'''''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:lightblue&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;''[[User talk:Velella|Velella]] Talk ''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; 19:10, 10 August 2011 (UTC)

:::I'm curious now to know how many of each style there are in the anglosphere. I've always had a '''Drivers License'''. – [[User:RVJ|RVJ]] ([[User talk:RVJ|talk]]) 06:24, 7 September 2011 (UTC)


It's &quot;Driver's License&quot; that makes little sense grammatically. You wouldn't have a dog's license or a marriage's license or a hunter's license or a gun's license. If you have a chauffeur and somebody asks you for HIS license, you'd be showing your driver's license. A driver's license is a license that belongs to a driver. A driver license is a license to drive. You'd expect the adjectival form of the word to say what is being licensed, such as a dog, a marriage, hunting, a gun, or a driver (or driving.) Driving License and Driver License make the most sense. 

However, this is not about opinion but accuracy. In the US, most states issue Driver Licenses, so that's what the article should mention. [[User:Hagrinas|Hagrinas]] ([[User talk:Hagrinas|talk]]) 18:16, 4 January 2012 (UTC)

===A further suggestion===

When we are referring to a specific licence, such as a 'UK driving licence' we should use the official spelling and form of words used for that specific licence in that specific country.

In all other cases, such as 'driving licences in Europe...' we should use more general terms like 'licenses to drive motor vehicles' or in some cases just 'licenses' (the readers will know what kind of licence we are referring to) to avoid endless argument about driver/driver's/drivers'/driving.  In this case we should use US spelling as this is the consensus spelling for this article. I have started this change, does anyone object? [[User:Martin Hogbin|Martin Hogbin]] ([[User talk:Martin Hogbin|talk]]) 10:49, 20 August 2011 (UTC)

===Spelling/terminology consensus===
I think it is fair to say that there is a consensus to do the following:
*Use the exact national or regional spelling and terminology when referring to a specific country, for example UK &quot;Driving Licence&quot; or US &quot;Driver's License&quot; .  (Note that the verb is still spelled with an 's' in Brit spelling, as in 'licensing'.)
*Use the US spelling 'license' when referring the the document in general.  
*When referring the the document in general, avoid the terms driver's/drivers'/driving where possible and use terms such as 'license to drive...' or just 'license' as context makes it obvious what kind of licence is being referred to.  
*Use the article title 'Driver's license' where there is no alternative.  [[User:Martin Hogbin|Martin Hogbin]] ([[User talk:Martin Hogbin|talk]]) 16:37, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::If you want to propose a move and change the whole article to UK English, that seems fine to me, if it will end the bickering.

::::I agree that spelling should be the same throughout an article, where this is possible, but when referring to an object than has a name in a particular country, we cannot change its name for the sake of consistency.  In the US the document is, I believe, a 'drivers license'.  In the UK it is a 'driving licence'; that is what it says on it.  If we were to be truly consistent the we would call them all 'drivers licenses' but the problem is that in WP we state facts, as given in reliable sources.  If the facts are not consistent from country to country the we cannot make them so.

:::::[[WP:ARTCON]] makes an exception for ''proper names''. If you are directly referring to the actual document -- capitalized an all -- then yes, use local spelling. But that doesn't mean each section uses a different spelling of license/license when used as a [[common noun]]. To use UK spelling for the common noun usage of license, propose a move and shift the whole article. I think most entries in the article use UK spelling, so I'd support it.

::::::In my opinion, if you are referring to a specific document (even if it is not a proper noun and not capitalised) you must use the actual name of the document.

:::::::::You're clearly confusing proper nouns with common nouns. You're claiming every instance of the phrase 'drivers license' is a proper noun, and that is incorrect. The MOS allows use of local spelling for proper nouns, and that should be enough.  And even then, we ''can'' &quot;change facts&quot;. We change Köln to [[Cologne]]. We change Roma to [[Rome]]. We do this in order to communicate clearly. Note that the article [[Marriage license]] is able to follow the MOS without having to resort to changing the spelling in every section. [[Birth certificate]] has no need to change spelling for each national section, except for proper nouns, per the MOS. Do we need to see 50 examples to make the point?&lt;P&gt;Again, why is this article special? Why can't it follow the same policy as other articles about legal documents?

::::::::: [[WP:ARTCON]], part of [[WP:ENGVAR]] is a guideline yes, but that means its a reflection of consensus on the issue. Articles which have words that can be spelt more than one way are in British English or American English (or less often Canadian or some other variety), not a mix of them. The exceptions are very narrow, with very particular reasons. There's no need to use both British English and American English in this case. It's especially bad practice here as it leads to both British and American spelling being used in the same paragraph, which is just bad writing. Stick to one variety of English except for the allowed exceptions.--&lt;small&gt;[[User:JohnBlackburne|JohnBlackburne]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:JohnBlackburne|words]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style=&quot;margin-left:-2.0ex;&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/JohnBlackburne|deeds]]&lt;/sub&gt; 15:41, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

We are free to choose the style of our own words but to to change the names (not chosen by us)of documents.

::::::::I disagree with the notion that articles on Wikipedia must always use one spelling/phrasing style exclusively for common nouns within them. I don't think the [[WP:MOS]] really requires that, and in some cases, that is simply not a practical possibility. If you think it is, I invite you to give it a try in the [[Whisky]] article. Some people use the spelling 'whisky' and some use 'whiskey', and the regional spelling difference is considered significant by many people. When covering a global subject on which such variations exist, there is nothing wrong with describing the differences in spelling and wording within the article and using the variant for a particular country within the discussion of that country. Of course, care should be taken to avoid creating confusing mixes of such things within the same sentence or paragraph (in the absence of quote marks or some other clue about what is happening), but trying to uniformly impose the variant used in one country in a discussion of the practices in a different country is not a good solution in all cases. —[[User:BarrelProof|BarrelProof]] ([[User talk:BarrelProof|talk]]) 16:46, 11 May 2014 (UTC)
{{outdent|::::::::}}[[Whisky]] cites only a blogger named Chuck Cowdery who has a couple blog posts about why the spelling of whisky matters, and why &quot;we&quot; write so much about the spelling of whisky. Cowdery seems to have a (self-published?) book that we could cite instead of his blog. So the first thing I would 'try' with [[Whisky]] is to replace the blog post citations in the spelling section with better sources. If they couldn't be found to support the assertion that 'the spelling of whisky matters' , I'd delete the section and use consistent spelling. But if we assume here in this discussion of license that this section over in [[Whisky]] is well sourced, and that it is verifiable that the spelling of whisky makes that much of a difference, then I'd probably support using different spellings throughout the article.&lt;P&gt;And so, by that standard, can we please see reliable sources which tell us that it makes an important difference whether we say license or licence? Or driver license, or driving licence? If it is really a fact that this difference is that important, then surely somebody other than some Wikipedia editors agrees that [[Driver's license]] is a special case.&lt;P&gt;Without sources saying [[Driver's license]] is different, then we ought to treat it the same as other articles, and follow the same MOS rules that other articles follow.

::We have no need to reinvent the wheel here. Wikipedia's has [[WP:ARTCON]]. The US defence minister is called the Secretary of Defense in an article that uses UK spelling. The UK defense secretary is the Defence Minister in an article that uses US spelling. The formal title, i.e. proper noun, is capitalized and spelled as per the local language. The name of the document, when referred to as its formal, proper noun, and capitalized, is in local spelling. My Washington driver's license is called a Driver License (reduced from all caps per [[MOS:ALLCAPS]]). It would be perfectly OK to refer to my Washington Driver License as a driving license, if this article is in UK spelling. But if the convention for this article going to remain US English, since there's no consensus on the move discussion below, then a New Zealand Driving License (proper noun) should be referred to as a driver's license when described as a common noun. All of the same arguments could be made in [[Marriage license]]. Do we want that article to be a melange of difference spellings?&lt;P&gt;Others have already pointed out that this is a Wikipedia wide guideline and other Wikipedians have already expended vast amounts of time reaching the compromise in [[WP:ARTCON]]. I would support deviating from WP:ARTCON if I were to see verifiable facts showing why driver's license is unique. Show evidence, and [[WP:IAR]] applies. Lacking evidence, then [[WP:ARTCON]] applies. --[[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 23:54, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

:::It seems to me that if we are talking about the concept of a license required to drive a vehicle, then we are not tied to any one particular country, variety of English or document. Hence, any one of the suggested alternatives (Driver license, Driver's license, Driving licence, etc) would be suitable as the title of the article because all are attested names in the real world. There is little reason to choose anyone over any other, so [[WP:RETAIN]] and [[WP:ENGVAR]] say to continue using the existing the title. [[WP:ARTCON]] says that once a variety of English has been chosen then that variety should be used throughout the article. Exceptions would be for mentioning the name of an explicit document (in which case it should have leading capitals) and for listing alternative names it is known by. So, the majority of the article should say &quot;driver's license&quot; (to match the title) but sections such 'North America' can mention that it is known as &quot;Driver License&quot; while still continuing to use &quot;driver's license&quot; (without capitals) in the rest of the section. This is both accurate and consistent. To chop and change the name used for every section is against all WP policies to do with varieties of English and also makes it look like a disjoint article written by separate amateurs - very unprofessional. &lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid blue;border-radius:4px;color:blue;box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px grey;&quot;&gt;[[User:Stepho-wrs|'''&amp;nbsp;Stepho&amp;nbsp;''']]&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:xx-small; vertical-align:top&quot;&gt;[[User Talk:Stepho-wrs|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 22:20, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

[[:Driver's license]] → {{no redirect|Driving licence}} – Dennis suggested that because, worldwide, it is a more common term, we should move the article to 'Driving licence'.  Let us do that.

I think you will find that many US editors will object because their actual licence has 'Drivers license' written on it, and I would support them. [[User:Martin Hogbin|Martin Hogbin]] ([[User talk:Martin Hogbin|talk]]) 16:07, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support''' moving the whole article to UK English. Note that this means we still must follow [[WP:ARTCON]] and use consistent spelling except for proper nouns. It's unlikely any US readers will object on the grounds that the document has &quot;Driver's license&quot; written on it. Mine says &quot;DRIVER LICENSE&quot; in all caps, with no S or apostrophe, but this difference is of no consequence. I can still, somehow, comprehend what &quot;drivers license&quot; and &quot;driver's licence&quot; mean in spite of the all caps and other differences. We have only one editor who has voiced this objection to WP:ARTCON, and otherwise there seems to be strong consensus in favor of following the MOS.

Hence, the singular appellation (the title in our case forms a compound proper noun) Driver License prevails as grammatically apt, coherent usage and supportable above all alternatives ... even though it may appear a bit awkward and resonate as an unfinished phrase.

Your apprehension of the true mechanics (pun | allusion) of Driver License entails your understanding of its component parts, their integrated and literal placement (or position) as well as operative relationships, which ignite their engine power plant aka rationale, steering Driver License and its standardized form and usage. 

All that is optimally explained by way of a pit stop, first, which involves the parsing a comparable example that, too, figuratively often crashes minds, leaving road kill and other unseemly litter on the printed page and monitors alike, and can turn off astute audiences, by many would be, if well informed, conscientious and otherwise road-worthy users of the English language, as they unwittingly speed along, creating abysmal communications, for lack of knowing how to improve their writing and speech.

Consider the much maligned and often confused use of the noun veterans (the plural form of veteran) in Veterans Day [the US of A or USA holiday by that name]: 

(a) its singular possessive reads veteran's; 

(b) its plural possessive should read veterans' [Useful Tip 1: often it appears without its needed possessive apostrophe; hence, ought is used verses should when issuing corrective notification of such an error; whereas, for added clarity and reference, in the instance of the proper noun (eg, a person's name) Charles (already ending in an &quot;s&quot;), ought to read as Charles's: William Strunk | E.B. White | Roger Angell: &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;; Rule #1 [do not misconstrue my citation of that &quot;mini-tome&quot; as my advocacy that any or all of those  three gentlemen rate(s) expert, current or correct on most of the points posited therein]; but, 

(c) when used as part of a compound proper noun eg, in an appellation (aka title aka name of holiday), such as Veterans Day, the &quot;s&quot;, because the noun behaves as attributive noun (yet plural) omits its apostrophe;

(d) applying that same construction logic to our quandary, the plural form of driver, drivers [indicating all drivers referenced, re a pool, whether by association organizationally, locally, regionally, or on a state, national, international, continental or worldwide level(s)], teamed with license [the second part of our compound new noun or noun phrase; because, drivers, its first position part, reads plural form, then its second position part (since all drivers would do not drive on a single license), license, needs to read correspondingly | congruently plural: licenses]: they join forces, creating drivers licenses: sans the apostrophe [again, owed to drivers behaving, in our noun phrase, as an attributive noun]. In other words, it (drivers) contributes to or can be said to clarify the secondary noun, licenses. Hence, in its new plural appellation form [proper noun: capitalized when used as a header, and in order instances according to one's operative Writing Style Guide's strictures], it should (again: ought implies that in most instances it is used ineptly and needs correction) read as Drivers Licenses (that plural usage appears typically in formal professional communications, such as this: 

&quot;.... State of New York's drivers licenses database is managed and accessed by authorized IT contributors and operations staff ... during SDLC's Phase III reengineering .....&quot;; likewise, 

(e) pared down, were you to refer to a single driver's official State of New York license, its formal and correct appellation should [Useful Tip 2: again, use ought where and when you correct an error] read driver (singular) license (singular): combined, as compound noun (specifically, in our case its forms an appellation aka compound proper noun), whose first noun behaves attributively; hence, as a header is should read: Driver License (which, that all said and done ... it does tend to &quot;hang on the top of one's tongue, unfinished, forcing a unsatisfying dry utterance&quot;).

Now you know that the attributive form is what accounts for the Driver License plague besetting all individual holders of a card that grants driving &quot;privileges in most of the US of A&quot; aka ID; now, you only need to concern yourself with buying auto insurance ... and database entries?

:I agree this move needs a bit more thought.  We now have an article with UK spelling in the title, which then switches to (mostly) US spelling in the article itself.  Following the move, do we really want to switch the body of the article from US spelling to British spelling?  I don't think that solves any problems.  The proposer of the move says that &quot;Driving licence&quot; is &quot;worldwide, the more common term&quot;, but I'm unconvinced - as far as I'm aware, &quot;Driving licence&quot; is used only in the UK and a handful of countries closely influenced by the UK (such as Ireland and Hong Kong).  Driving licence is not the term used in the US, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand. If we go through the article to change the US English to UK spelling, I don't think there will be any improvement in consistency to justify the work involved.  Switching an article from US to UK spelling or vice versa is something we should only be doing with very good reason, and I don't think we have that here. That's particularly so as the title has used the US spelling (license) ever since it was created 13 years ago. [[User:Enchanter|Enchanter]] ([[User talk:Enchanter|talk]]) 14:55, 25 May 2014 (UTC)
::The whole point of the discussion was to change the spelling of the whole article, not merely the title. Now the spelling throughout the article needs to change to UK English. Except for proper names of specific documents, which would be capitalized. This does not need more discussion. There was a long discussion by many editors, and now it's settled. --[[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 15:23, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::In what sense did I lose that debate?  I accept that I was a little over zealous in pressing for national spellings within the article although that was partly because of your heavy handed editing. 
:::::You seem to agree that when referring to a specific document, for example 'a UK driving licence', we should use the correct name and spelling but that does not mean that we 'driving licence' is a proper noun and should be capitalised. [[User:Martin Hogbin|Martin Hogbin]] ([[User talk:Martin Hogbin|talk]]) 18:31, 25 May 2014 (UTC) 
::::::You failed to convince anyone that using a variant spelling for a common noun is not &quot;factually correct&quot;. You failed to convince anyone that [[WP:ARTCON]] allows using variant spelling for anything but proper names, quotations, and passages that describe spelling variation itself. If it's not normally capitalized, then it's not a proper name -- exceptions to that rule are very rare and the term driver's license is not one of the rare exceptions. The change you wanted to make was rejected. Regardless of whether this article keeps US or UK spelling, there is consensus that WP:ARTCON is the last word on consistency. There is consensus that WP:ARTCON is clear and unambiguous. Hence the need to drop it and use consistent spelling throughout the article, with three and only thjree well-defined, widely-understood exceptions. --[[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 20:38, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

To summarise, I suggest that the decision to change the article from US to UK spelling is reviewed, because:
* The original reason given for the move to &quot;Driving licence&quot; was &quot;Dennis suggested that ... worldwide, it is a more common term&quot;.  However, there is no backing information given for this and it is not at all clear that that is true.  &quot;Driving licence&quot; is to my knowledge only used in the UK and a handful of other English speaking countries with close links to the UK (such as Ireland, Hong Kong and South Africa).  It is not the term commonly used in the US, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand.
* The requested move had six in favour and six opposed.  Of those in favour, four specifically gave as their reason that they believed that the article had started off with UK spelling &quot;Driving licence&quot; and moved later.  This is not the case (although it's an easy mistake to make given the cut and paste moves).  The [http://nostalgia.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Driving_license original article] had the title &quot;Driving license&quot; (US spelling), and was later moved (by me) to &quot;Driver's license&quot; (still US spelling, with more consistent terminology).  The reasoning for most of those in favour of the move was based on a mistaken understanding of the facts.
In summary, if the move is to stand, I think that someone needs to set out the rationale for the move more clearly - looking at the discussion I don't think anyone has set out a clear, compelling argument for why this article should change from US to UK spelling. We shouldn't go moving articles from US to UK spelling without good reasons.  [[User:Enchanter|Enchanter]] ([[User talk:Enchanter|talk]]) 17:22, 25 May 2014 (UTC)

::::::Concur with Enchanter and HiLo48.  It also looks as if at least some of the editors who pushed this unnecessary move and style change are moving very quickly to create the false illusion of consensus for their position.  Acting in good faith would mean holding the move discussion open for at least a month and advertising it on the village pump to solicit community input on such a high-profile topic.

Currently, the United States section states:

&quot;The eligible age varies substantially by state. Nationally by age 16 one can obtain a license after passing the requisite tests and drive without adult supervision.&quot;

As the first sentence states there is no national law determining when one can obtain a license and it varies by state from 14 years 3 months to 17 years. The wording of that second sentence is also a bit unclear. I propose changing the sentence to read:

&quot;The eligible age to obtain a drivers license varies substantially from state to state. In a majority of states one can obtain a license that allows driving without adult supervision by age 16, after passing the requisite tests.&quot;
