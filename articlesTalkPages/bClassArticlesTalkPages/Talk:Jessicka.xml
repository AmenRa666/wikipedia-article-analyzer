==Inappropriate Tone==
I removed this tag.
With some help I am doing some copy editing to make sure this article is wiki friendly.

== Cleanup? ==

Why is this marked as such? It seems fine. [[User:4.224.165.144|4.224.165.144]] 07:37, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
:There's no rationale behind the marking of it, so I removed it in addition to rewording a few things. If someone can provide rationale for the cleanup tag to be readded, then please do so and readd it to the article. [[User:63.233.72.107|63.233.72.107]] 09:34, 4 March 2006 (UTC)
:: I would say it's lacking in third-party sources, has many unsupported statements, and is somewhat press-kit-ish.  That's probably the suggested cleanup.  Make it more boring and encyclopedia-like.--[[User:Larrybob|Larrybob]] 02:02, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

::: yes that's basically it (phrases like &quot;gut-wrenching&quot; and &quot;fierce&quot; - also some of the content is straight cut and pastes from other sources (such as the statement I just removed from triva). - that needs to be removed.

==Edits/Hullaballoo Wolfowitz==
[[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]], I'd like you to take a closer look at the edits I recently reverted. I think you'll see that they are both valid.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jessicka&amp;diff=298452762&amp;oldid=298452558] &quot;Piper Ferguson * Photography, Cover Photo&quot; and the photo is of Jessicka.. How else do you want it stated?

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jessicka&amp;diff=298451993&amp;oldid=298449820] The L Word online is a comprehensive collection of everything concerning the TV show [[The L Word]]. It states very clearing that Scarling's song Bummer was on the episode Latecomer. I feel the ref. is good.

As posted here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Benjiboi
&quot;I'm tired of the revert war. I'm tired of being accused of being a sock or a SPA. I'm tired of hearing Hullaballoo refer to artists and musicians I like as &quot;c list celebrities&quot; and losers and hounding my every edit. I'm going to research and gather some references to improve the article Jessicka. At which point I'm hoping Benjiboi will check my work. Clearly, he is willing to talk to me and tell what I'm doing wrong if anything at all. After that Hullaballoo you can have at the article. Is that fair? It will take me a bit - so in the meantime I'd like to leave the article as is. If you can't do this Hullaballoo then I believe my assumption to be right and that you are only editing this article in order to get to a place for another editor to nominate it for speedy deletion. Benjiboi is this ok with you? Swancookie (talk) 23:05, 24 June 2009 (UTC)&quot;

I'm hoping Bejiboi will agree... and we can end this edit war for good. Your thoughts?
[[User:Swancookie|Swancookie]] ([[User talk:Swancookie|talk]]) 23:35, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

:I have a better idea. You stop making edits to biographies and other articles concerning living persons that don't comply with [[WP:BLP]] and [[WP:RS]], particularly with regard to self-published sources. You stop posting personal attacks and completely groundless claims of bias, dishonesty, and other misbehavior.  We went to AN/I on this already, and the outcome was clear enough. And you should also stop complaining about being described as an SPA, since the only substantive editing you've done here since ending your supposed Wikibreak ended has been to reinsert favorable/promotional material regarding the two members of a band who you have implied a personal acquaintance with, despite having been told by multiple editors that the material fails Wikipedia sourcing requirements.  Your discussions consistently fail to comment on content rather than contributors.  I look at your editing history and to me it screams SPA and COI.  You're just coming off a 3RR ban, and your response is to edit war articles without using meaningful edit summaries while posting obsessive diatribes about the Big Bad Wolfowitz.  This isn't about me, or Ricky, or BigDaddy, or Bali ultimate (who you and your buddies have helped hound off Wikipedia.  It's a very simple BLP sourcing issue, and you aren't even trying to comply with Wikipedia sourcing policies -- as is evident by the fact that you're edit warring to use a self-published fan site as a reference. And you're being remarkably hypocritical about &quot;hounding,&quot; since you showed up here and announced your main purpose was to undo my edits. [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] ([[User talk:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|talk]]) 00:21, 25 June 2009 (UTC)


Please take your accusations down a peg. I'm truly trying to be civil here. You've been told by multiple editors that your tone is uncivil yet you continually demean and throw insults around at anybody who does not agree with you. 
I've not even had the chance to edit any articles here besides the ones you have mentioned since we've been reverting back and forth. I clearly don't have as much free time as you do. I am not personally attacking you. Where are these personal attacks you speak of? It's MHO that you indeed have a bias. That's not an attack it's an opinion. I have never implied that I'm personal acquaintances with either person. Please show me where I have? You need to to stop making things up here. Isn't there something in wiki policy about outing people?
I need a third party to check this source [http://www.thelwordonline.com/music.html]. As much as you clearly don't trust me to not be a spa or vandal, I can't trust your opinions when it comes to references. Fair enough?

&quot;remarkably hypocritical about &quot;hounding&quot; Pot calling Kettle? You edit every article mentioning Christian Hejnal or his wife. And I'm the one who's hypocritical and obsessed?
 
You clearly are not going to take any responsibility when it comes exacerbating this situation, are you?
I understand how frustrating dealing with new editors can be but you are simply not willing to be civil. I am asking you in good faith to take what I'm saying here at face value. I'm only trying to improve these articles. Are you?


==Alternative Press (Jessicka) quote/ citation==
Discussion about this can be found here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Swancookie#LGBT_Question.2Fresponse]
[[User:Swancookie|Swancookie]] ([[User talk:Swancookie|talk]]) 23:45, 24 June 2009 (UTC)
:Wikipedia sourcing policy is quite clear: you must accurately describe the source you are linking to, and you must link only to sources which meet [[WP:RS]]. You repeatedly inserted links that were described as going to various independent, reliable publications, but actually went to a collection of unverifiable press clips on the article subject's own web sites. That's not just a violation of Wikipedia policy, it's a fundamentally dishonest practice. [[User:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|Hullaballoo Wolfowitz]] ([[User talk:Hullaballoo Wolfowitz|talk]]) 00:24, 25 June 2009 (UTC)
 

How is dishonest when that article indeed exists in real. Shall I scan it to show you? I was told when linking a citation that is not online it is fine to use a source (like the artist's website) as a reliable source.

I need another party to have a look at these changes. Like I've said over &amp; over Hullaballoo has a weird bias against this article.
I was under the impression a person's website served as a reliable source.

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Jessicka]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=699435868 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20070818083957/http://www.rockrgrl.com/backissues.php?year=2004 to http://www.rockrgrl.com/backissues.php?year=2004

When you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the ''checked'' parameter below to '''true''' to let others know.

{{sourcecheck|checked=false}}
