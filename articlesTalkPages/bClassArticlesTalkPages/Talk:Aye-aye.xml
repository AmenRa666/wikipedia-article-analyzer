== Fairy tale witch?! ==

What is up with that?  What does that mean?
&lt;blockquote&gt;Much like other primates, it possesses opposable thumbs, but both the hallux and the fingers are long and thin, and appear to be in a curved position somewhat similar to that of a fairy-tale witch when the muscles are relaxed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aye-Aye a species of Lemur? ==

there is no mention on the article about the Aye-Aye being a lemur.......even if it is only &quot;thought&quot; to be one (i.e. scientist's are debating about what it's related to)


== Inconsistent capitalisation ==

The capitalisation of the name in this article is inconsistent. As the common name of an animal, shouldn't it always be spelt &quot;aye-aye&quot;?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/205.205.104.56|205.205.104.56]] ([[User talk:205.205.104.56|talk]]) 16:28, 5 December 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== echo location ==

Just saw on [[eggheads]] that aye-ayes are the only mamal to catch their prey using echo location.

:Sounds like total nonsense. Bats and dolphins are both mammals and use echolocation to hunt.[[User:Sbwoodside|Sbwoodside]] ([[User talk:Sbwoodside|talk]]) 22:01, 4 July 2008 (UTC)
:Eggheads keeps erroneously attributing that to random mammals. Game shows tends to not be very encyclopedic.[[Special:Contributions/152.1.22.160|152.1.22.160]] ([[User talk:152.1.22.160|talk]]) 22:48, 18 September 2008 (UTC)

== Uh. Naval terms? ==

Marines and sailors say &quot;aye-aye&quot; (or simply &quot;aye&quot;) in acknowledgement of a given order. I was a bit surprised to find this article instead of a disambiguation page when I clicked on the link from [[List_of_U.S._Marine_Corps_acronyms_and_expressions#A]]. -- [[User:Cuervo|Cuervo]], not logged in [[Special:Contributions/76.176.168.180|76.176.168.180]] ([[User talk:76.176.168.180|talk]]) 03:37, 30 January 2009 (UTC)

== endangered Aye Aye ==

According to most WEB data I found, there are about 1000 to 2000 Aye Ayes living today, so declaring the species as only &quot;Near Threatened&quot; seems to be inaccurate.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/85.64.40.205|85.64.40.205]] ([[User talk:85.64.40.205|talk]]) 15:53, 12 July 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:In the past, the Aye-aye was considered more rare and was a poorly understood animal. More recently, it has been found in many places on the island, and is now considered one of the more widely distributed of the indigenous primate species.  Its numbers are not high at any location and it's in the decline due to habitat degradation and loss.  According to the IUCN (link found in the page's references):
:{{pull quote|float=left|Listed as Near Threatened as although the species is now known to be widespread and adaptable, it is thought to have undergone a reduction of 20-25% over the past 24 years (assuming a generation length of 8 years) due primarily to a decline in area and quality of habitat and ongoing levels of exploitation/persecution. Almost qualifies as threatened under criterion A2cd.}}{{clear}}
:Of course, we can only report how the IUCN assesses its status.  They are the primary authority. &amp;ndash;[[User:Visionholder|Visionholder]] ([[User talk:Visionholder|talk]]) 16:14, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

== Re-classification discussion ==

I am preparing to adjust the classification of this species per numerous sources.  Please join the discussion on the [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Primates#Infraorder_Chiromyiformes.E2.80.94Aye-aye_re-classification|WP:PRIMATE discussion page]] before I make any changes. &amp;ndash;[[User:Visionholder|Visionholder]] ([[User talk:Visionholder|talk]]) 23:42, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

== Re-write still coming... ==

I had planned to re-write this article in December 2011, but circumstances thwarted the effort.  I have been making plans since, but other articles have emerged as priorities, and now I have an important essay to write for an academic journal.  To anyone following my edit comments promising an upcoming re-write, it is still a priority for this year.  I plan to resume once I finish the [[toothcomb]] article, the [[grooming claw]] article, my essay, and another etymology publication for ''Lemur News''.  Following this article, I plan to shift gears and finish all the subfossil lemur articles.  After that (and probably in 2013... maybe earlier), I plan to re-write some of the most noteworthy lemur articles as well as the more general family articles.  Sorry for the delays. &lt;span style=&quot;text-shadow:grey 0.1em 0.1em 0.3em; font-family: fantasy, cursive, Serif&quot;&gt;'''–&amp;nbsp;[[User:Maky|&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Maky&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;«[[User talk:Maky|&lt;font color=&quot;olive&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;]]»&lt;/sup&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt; 06:40, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

In the infobox title, two references are cited.  Does anyone know why these are there?__[[User:DrChrissy|DrChrissy]] ([[User talk:DrChrissy|talk]]) 18:03, 3 February 2015 (UTC)
:I think it originally started with a tendency to point articles to Groves taxonomic work, which (early in my editing career) I augmented by pointing to a more updated book.

== Taxobox image ==

I added a hi res photo (close up of the head) instead of an old, low-res black/white drawing to the taxobox and was reverted. It seems to be generally agreed that photos of live, wild animals are preferred in the taxobox over drawings. The rationale was that it showed the whole animal, but I don't see why that should trump an actual photo. Here's a photo where almost as much is seen of the animal.[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aye-aye_%28Daubentonia_madagascariensis%29_2b.jpg] Any thoughts?

:Hi.  I was the one that reverted the previous photo.  I felt it was such a close-up that it was more of a portrait and perhaps not terribly helpful to readers considering the unusual nature of this animal.  The image in your edit above is fine in my opinion and shows the digits very well.

::::Well, you can see the big bushy tail hanging to the right, so the only thing you can't see is the feet, actually. And you can actually see the toes of one foot if you look closely.

== 3rd or 4th digit? ==

In the prologue it is clearly mentioned that the animal uses it's 3rd digit to pull the grubs out. Strangely, in main text, the 4th digit is mentioned for the same function. I do believe that the last one is wrong, because the longest digit is the 3rd, not the 4th!

Looking carefully at the photo in the text, one can see that the 4th digit is the longest one, but the problem remains. Which finger is used to extract larvae?</text>
