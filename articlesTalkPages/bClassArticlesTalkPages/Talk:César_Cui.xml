== Date of death ==
There are different death dates reported in the literature, mainly 13 &lt;s&gt;February&lt;/s&gt; March, 24 &lt;s&gt;February&lt;/s&gt; March (Grove et al) and 26 &lt;s&gt;February&lt;/s&gt; March (Slonimsky et al).   I trust Slonimsky over Grove, and I trust either of them over non-lexicographical sources.  

I suspect the 13 &lt;s&gt;February&lt;/s&gt; March date came from someone inappropriately converting the 26 &lt;s&gt;February&lt;/s&gt; March date back to the Julian calendar, despite the fact that Russia had adopted the Gregorian calendar the month before Cui died.  Immediately after then, communications being what they were, I’m sure there was a transitional period when there was a lot of confusion going on.  --  [[User:JackofOz|JackofOz]] ([[User talk:JackofOz|talk]]) 05:47, 17 July 2008 (UTC)

:According to Nazarov's biography (p. 221), the death date was March 13, at 9:30 a.m. (noting also that various encyclopedias incorrectly give the date as Mar 26). I have edited the date in the main article to reflect this. [[User:Mllefifi|Mademoiselle Fifi]] ([[User talk:Mllefifi|talk]]) 01:07, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

::Thanks for the clarification.  (I typed February above when I meant March - now corrected).  --  [[User:JackofOz|JackofOz]] ([[User talk:JackofOz|talk]]) 01:59, 18 July 2008 (UTC)

== Composer project review ==
I've reviewed this article as part of the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Composers|Composers project]] review of its B-class articles.  This article is a decent B-class, but it has a number of issues, including aspects of his life and music that need to be elaborated.  My full review is on the [[/Comments|comments]] page; questions and comments should be left here or on my talk page.

This is an assessment of article '''[[{{BASEPAGENAME}}]]''' by a member of the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Composers|Composers]] project, according to its [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Composers/Assessment|assessment]] criteria.  This review was done by {{UT|Magicpiano}}.

If an article is well-cited, the reviewer is assuming that the article reflects reasonably current scholarship, and deficiencies in the historical record that are documented in a particular area will be appropriately scored.  If insufficient inline citations are present, the reviewer will assume that deficiencies in that area may be cured, and that area may be scored down.

Adherence to overall Wikipedia standards ([[WP:MOS]], [[WP:WIAGA]], [[WP:WIAFA]]) are the reviewer's opinion, and are not a substitute for the Wikipedia's processes for awarding [[WP:GAN|Good Article]] or [[WP:FAC|Featured Article]] status.

{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}Origins/family background/studies{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
Does the article reflect what is known about the composer's background and childhood?  If s/he received musical training as a child, who from, is the experience and nature of the early teachers' influences described?
*{{GAList/check|y}} ok
{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}Early career{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
Does the article indicate when s/he started composing, discuss early style, success/failure?  Are other pedagogic and personal influences from this time on his/her music discussed?
*{{GAList/check|y}} ok
{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}Mature career{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
Does the article discuss his/her adult life and composition history?  Are other pedagogic and personal influences from this time on his/her music discussed?
*{{GAList/check|y}} ok
{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}List(s) of works{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
Are lists of the composer's works in WP, linked from this article?  If there are special catalogs (e.g. Köchel for Mozart, Hoboken for Haydn), are they used?  If the composer has written more than 20-30 works, any exhaustive listing should be placed in a separate article.
*{{GAList/check|y}} ok; difficulty in filling written bibliography noted.
{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}Critical appreciation{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
Does the article discuss his/her style, reception by critics and the public (both during his/her life, and over time)?
*{{GAList/check|???}} Style could use some work.  Critical and popular reaction (contemporary) is lacking.  Some historical commentary.
{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}Illustrations and sound clips{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
Does the article contain images of its subject, birthplace, gravesite or other memorials, important residences, manuscript pages, museums, etc?  Does it contain samples of the composer's work (as composer and/or performer, if appropriate)?  (Note that since many 20th-century works are copyrighted, it may not be possible to acquire more than brief [[WP:FAIRUSE|fair use]] samples of those works, but efforts should be made to do so.)  If an article is of high enough quality, do its images and media comply with [[WP:IUP|image use policy]] and [[WP:NFCC|non-free content policy]]? (Adherence to these is needed for Good Article or Featured Article consideration, and is apparently a common reason for nominations being quick-failed.)
*{{GAList/check|y}} Images ok; no sound.
{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}References, sources and bibliography{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
Does the article contain a suitable number of references?  Does it contain sufficient inline citations?  (For an article to pass [[WP:WIAGA|Good Article]] nomination, every paragraph possibly excepting those in the lead, and every direct quotation, ''should'' have at least one footnote.)  If appropriate, does it include Further Reading or Bibliography beyond the cited references?
*{{GAList/check|y}} Article is referenced; mostly inline cited.
{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}Structure and compliance with WP:MOS{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
Does the article comply with Wikipedia style and layout guidelines, especially [[WP:MOS]], [[WP:LEAD]], [[WP:LAYOUT]], and possibly [[WP:SIZE]]?  (Article length is not generally significant, although Featured Articles Candidates may be questioned for excessive length.)
*{{GAList/check|???}} Lead is short.
{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}Things that may be necessary to pass a [[WP:WIAGA|Good Article]] review{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
* Article requires more inline citations ([[WP:CITE]])
* Article lead needs work ([[WP:LEAD]])
&lt;!--
Reviewer: cut/paste from these as needed:
* Article requires more inline citations ([[WP:CITE]])
* Article lead needs work ([[WP:LEAD]])
* Article footer material needs organization ([[WP:LAYOUT]])
* Article needs (more) images and/or other media ([[MOS:IMAGE]])
* Images and media have copyright/fair-use issues ([[WP:IUP]] or more specific GA/FA criteria)
* Article prose needs work ([[WP:MOS]])
* Article text formatting needs work (e.g. quotation methods, punctuation, inconsistent styles)

{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}Summary{{nw=}}{{nw=}}{{nw=}}
This is a pretty nice bio, but not without some issues.  One thing that troubled me was an implication that, as part of his professional and musical duties, he must have traveled fairly extensively.  However, there is not much mention of this.  (For example: he wrote about Wagner's 1876 Ring -- was he there?  Also: did he travel to see his operas performed in foreign cities?)  While he is clearly more known in the West for his music and related work, I do not think short shrift should be given to his military career -- it clearly seems important and worthy of more space than it has.

The musicology could be improved.  Most of what is described is the types of work he wrote; there is relatively little stylistic analysis, and no (or little) contemporary public or critical reaction to his works.

Article is B-class, but it could use some work. ''[[User:Magicpiano|&lt;span style{{nw=}}&quot;background-color:khaki;color:firebrick;&quot;&gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt;]]''[[User_talk:Magicpiano|♪piano]] 01:48, 17 February 2009 (UTC)}}
