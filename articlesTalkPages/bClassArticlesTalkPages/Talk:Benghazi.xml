==Benghazi==
NPOV: whole bottom section is hopeless. Can someone with the time and inclination write up an encyclopedic and referenced blurb about the disturbances? Thanks in advance. - &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[[User:Crzrussian|the.crazy.russian]] [[User_talk:Crzrussian|τ]] [[Special:Contributions/Crzrussian|ç]] [[Special:Emailuser/Crzrussian|ë]]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 18:50, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

The Turkish etymology &quot;thousand veterans&quot; is based on Modern (Standard / Urban) Turkish. The Ottoman word for &quot;thousand&quot; was bi*ng* (still survives in rural dialects) not bin and was spelled with kaf not nun.

== New Article ==

I've rewritten much of the article and removed all the information about the AIDS trial which took up 90% of the old article. [[User:Jaw101ie|Jaw101ie]] 11:16, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

==WPCities==
Hey all, I'm the WikiProject Cities assessor of this article. If feedback is what you want and need, come to my talk page and give me a holler! --'''[[User:Starstriker7|Starstriker7]]'''(&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Starstriker7|Say hi]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Starstriker7|or see my works]]&lt;/sub&gt;) 21:57, 24 September 2008 (UTC)

==Urban Design pattern ==
Pretty old Mediterranean cities like Benghazi dot the north coast landscape of the country. This city is the illustration of the principles was founded upon: closeness, unity, community, and family. The neighborhoods were compact and had mixed-uses. Everything a family needed in the normal course of the week was all within walking distance. There was a town square where the townspeople met and talked. In the youth of this country small developments like these were common,--[[User:Walid.omeir|Walid.omeir]] ([[User talk:Walid.omeir|talk]]) 10:56, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

==New Assessment==
Over the last several weeks, I've rewritten a lot of this article. I've bumped up its quality rating to B-Class. Anybody have any comments?[[User:Jaw101ie|Jaw101ie]] ([[User talk:Jaw101ie|talk]]) 10:34, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

== Cursory review ==

Daaang. :D

Jaw101ie, this is awesome. You've expanded this article immensely. I believe that your re-rating is justified.

There were a few things I noticed upon an initial check; based on the article's size, the lead should be [[WP:LEAD#Length|three or four paragraphs long]]; also, there are a number of paragraphs throughout the article that really need citations (for example, the history section has [[Benghazi#Romans|a few paragraphs with sparse citations]], while others [[Benghazi#Ottoman province|like this one]] lack citations altogether). Also, have there been any new developments lately in the [[Benghazi#Transport|Transport section]]?

The last thing I noticed were the formatting of the citations in the References section. They should all be consistent. Using templates like {{[[Template:Citeweb|Citeweb]]}} and {{[[Template:Cite journal|Citejournal]]}} really help.

Again, nice work. If you need additional help, you can find me on my talk page, although I might be a bit unreliable because of my schedule, but I'm always worth a try. :]

== war coverage ==

We should not be adding individual events (like a bomb blast) to this article.  As time passes, we may see a particular incident as standing out.  But given the scale of the war, a single bombing, doesn't normally warrant a mention.  --[[User:Thivierr|Rob]] ([[User talk:Thivierr|talk]]) 16:46, 2 June 2011 (UTC)
:That was 2011; this is 2012 and current events are very important. [[User:Charles Edwin Shipp|Charles Edwin Shipp]] ([[User talk:Charles Edwin Shipp|talk]]) 14:59, 1 October 2012 (UTC)

== Demographics ==

From what I can see, there are no real/true sources in the «Demographics» section. I have added several 'citation needed' tags, and one 'clean-up remainder' tag, for it's all without any source whatsoever. If there is anyone who can and/or is willing to improve this: be welcome! [[User:Robster1983|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Cursive MS; color:Green&quot;&gt;'''「Robster1983」'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Robster1983|&lt;font color=&quot;Purple&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;☞&lt;/big&gt; Life's short, talk fast &lt;big&gt;☜&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 13:49, 6 September 2011 (UTC)
===Total clean-up needed===
After looking at most of the article, I reckon the article could use an entire clean-up, for there are very little sources used. [[User:Robster1983|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Cursive MS; color:Green&quot;&gt;'''「Robster1983」'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Robster1983|&lt;font color=&quot;Purple&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;☞&lt;/big&gt; Life's short, talk fast &lt;big&gt;☜&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 13:54, 6 September 2011 (UTC)
: I see here now 42 references plus a number of websites, with most of the content not subject to debate. Can you name the problems you see a bit more precisely? --[[User:Bernd.Brincken|Bernd.Brincken]] ([[User talk:Bernd.Brincken|talk]]) 15:51, 24 December 2011 (UTC)

== Culture ==

No references, seems to be more opinionated - needs clean up.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/72.10.146.102|72.10.146.102]] ([[User talk:72.10.146.102|talk]]) 23:59, 11 November 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== US Ambassador's murder ==

There is not a single mention or link in this article about the [[2012 Benghazi attack|Sep 2012 incident]] where 52 people were murdered by Al Qaida operatives, including the [[J. Christopher Stevens|US Ambassador]] to Libya. — [[User:Loadmaster|Loadmaster]] ([[User talk:Loadmaster|talk]]) 19:12, 3 January 2013 (UTC)
:I gave it a sub-heading under &quot;history&quot; - since it isn't part of the 2011 revolution, and seems to warrant a separate heading.  The word &quot;Benghazi&quot; has become synonymous with the attack.  That may fade with time, but that's the city's current &quot;claim to fame.&quot; [[User:John2510|John2510]] ([[User talk:John2510|talk]]) 19:56, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

== Stand down orders omitted ==

It has been widely reported that orders were given to stand down to all rescue forces beginning with Woods and Doherty who were at the annex when they heard the attack begin.  It was reported they were ordered to stand down two more times when they were at the embassy manning the machine gun emplacement on the roof requesting air support and targeting enemy mortars with lasers.  These facts have been omitted from this article entirely, apparently because the government will not verify this order.  It should be noted that because the government will not verify a known fact while engaging in a cover up does not make it false.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Dusty103|Dusty103]] ([[User talk:Dusty103|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dusty103|contribs]]) 23:48, 11 May 2014 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
