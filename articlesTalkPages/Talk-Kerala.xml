== HDI ==
Kerala HDI is given in  India Human Development Report 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamrindia.gov.in/ihdr_book.pdf|title=India Human Development Report 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as .790. The sidebar says HDI is .94 and it provides a dead link to the same report. I couldn't find any other official report that mentioned a higher HDI either by GOI or UN. There were news article but nothing official. I am changing it to .790 which is still High.

== Images ==

See my previous post [[Talk:Kerala/Archive_6#Images_in_Culture_section]]. This article attracts many image additions, but we're not an [[WP:NOT|indiscriminate collection of images]]. Note that per [[WP:IMGLOC]] images are typically interspaced left to right from the article text and do not break the prose formatting [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kerala&amp;curid=4349459&amp;diff=708397028&amp;oldid=708224939#Religion like this]. The criteria for selecting images is based on [[WP:PERTINENCE]]: they should be relevant to the article, preferably mentioned in the article text and near it. Text sandwiched between images and spaced-out broken text in an indication of excess images.

===Vadakkunnathan Temple ===
[[:File:Vadakkumnathan Temple.jpg|Vadakkumnathan Temple.jpg]]

I oppose the addition of this image because of many reasons. It's not discussed in the article, there is simply no place for it, and it gives undue focus to specific Hindu temple (Why only this temple? why not other ones? or why not a church or mosque? in fact they're mentioned in the article). [[User:Ugog Nizdast|Ugog&amp;nbsp;Nizdast]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Ugog Nizdast|talk]]) 13:33, 5 March 2016 (UTC)
:I agree that there is no need for addition of that image. It is not really helpful. '''''&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Bradley Hand ITC&quot;&gt;[[User:Yash!|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;Ya&lt;/span&gt;]][[User talk:Yash!|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Yash!|&lt;span style=&quot;color:black&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;''''' 17:52, 5 March 2016 (UTC)

===Anamudi===
There are many images to choose from at [[c:Category:Anamudi|the commons]]. I chose [[:file:Anaimudi.jpg]] over [[:File:Anamudi from Munnar Gundumalai road.jpg|Anamudi from Munnar Gundumalai road.jpg]] because I found the latter a bit dubious. If it's the highest peak, what's the other one to left looking slightly higher than it? I'm just curious that's all. The first image seems more clearer but it's authenticity is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kerala&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=710339790&amp;oldid=710306067#Geography doubted]. pinging {{u|Qcrepku1}} do I go by your word alone that it's not the peak? [[User:Ugog Nizdast|Ugog&amp;nbsp;Nizdast]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Ugog Nizdast|talk]]) 19:40, 16 March 2016 (UTC)
: Fair question, {{u|Ugog Nizdast}}. I have written about this in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anamudi talk page for Anamudi]. Most of the images claiming to be of Anamudi are taken along the road on which you have the bus shuttle service for the [[Eravikulam National Park]]. The shuttle service on this road starts from 10°08′13.12″N 77°03′34.31″E and ends somewhere around 10°08′32.92″N 77°02′09.56″E. One cannot see Anamudi in this whole stretch of the road, which can be quite easily checked via Google Earth. The earlier [[:File:Anaimudi.jpg|image]], which is of Anamudi's satellite peak called Naikolli Mala, is taken from this road looking north-northwest. Many of the images from [[c:Category:Anamudi|the commons]] are taken along this stretch and frequently mistake Naikolli Mala as Anamudi. 
:For the image I have put [[:File:Anamudi from Munnar Gundumalai road.jpg|currently]], an approximate location from where the image was taken would be 10°09′02.32″N 77°04′41.83″E. One can go to this location on Google Earth,  look towards northwest and sweep left to the west. We can see three peaks, the right most of which is Anamudi. The left most peak is Naikolli Mala, which is where the Eravikulam National Park bus service goes. The peak in the centre is a subsidiary peak, which is closer to us than Anamudi. This is the other peak in the current image you are referring to. The reason why it looks higher is that it is closer to the viewpoint than Anamudi is. Hope this clears your doubts.

== Church, Mosque and Synagogue legend ==

What &quot;legend&quot; is this referring to? &quot;''According to the &lt;u&gt;legends&lt;/u&gt; of these communities, the earliest Saint Thomas Christian Churches,[53] Cheraman Juma Masjid (629 CE)—the first mosque of India[54]—and Paradesi Synagogue (1568 CE)—the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations[55]—were built in Kerala.''&quot; I think this can be removed and stated as fact.  [[User:Ugog Nizdast|Ugog&amp;nbsp;Nizdast]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Ugog Nizdast|talk]]) 02:52, 11 March 2016 (UTC)
:done. [[User:Ugog Nizdast|Ugog&amp;nbsp;Nizdast]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Ugog Nizdast|talk]]) 19:43, 16 March 2016 (UTC)

== Radiation area and Healthcare sections ==

*Naturally High background area needn't be a separate subsection, barely a two-three sentence para isn't fit for it; stubby sections are discouraged per [[WP:MOS|MOS]]. The content about it is more relevant to maybe the [[Karunagappally]] page than here, see [[WP:UNDUE]]. 
*I agree we need a healthcare section but not in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kerala&amp;curid=4349459&amp;diff=720838531&amp;oldid=720529466#Health this form]. I object to the lack of [[WP:MEDRS]] sources used for healthcare claims like this one &quot;use of chewing tobacco, &quot;fast food&quot; diets, the highest alcohol consumption per capita in the country and &quot;indiscriminate&quot; pesticide use are considered to be contributing factors&quot; to IAforums.com. This statement cannot be put unless the reliability of the source is confirmed (maybe post at the [[WP:RSN]]?) or a MEDRS-compliant source is used. 

I have partially reverted accordingly and reorganised some leftover content about healthcare into a new section, along with what was added. [[User:Ugog Nizdast|Ugog&amp;nbsp;Nizdast]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Ugog Nizdast|talk]]) 14:48, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
