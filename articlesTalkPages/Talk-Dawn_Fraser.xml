==3 consecutive gold medals==
3 consecutive gold medals.... Unless I am mistaken, Isn't dawn the only person in history to win 3 consecutive Olympic gold medals in the same event?  If so I think this is surley worth a mention here.  Thank you
:No. The record for consecutive golds in the same event is four, held by discus thrower Al Oerter and long jumper Carl Lewis. Fraser's achievement is impressive, but not a record.[[User:Jsc1973|Jsc1973]] 22:48, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

::It's a record for Olympic swimming events, but not for Olympic events overall.  [[User:JackofOz|JackofOz]] 05:34, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

==Sexuality==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dawn_Fraser&amp;oldid=37337417 Back in 2006], we said:
* ''After a short-lived marriage in the 1960s, it was often rumoured that she was a lesbian. In 2000, she published an autobiography in which she acknowledged one brief affair with a woman at a time of great emotional stress, but that she did not consider herself homosexual.''

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dawn_Fraser&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=232725728 Then it became]: 
* ''She has never remarried, which led some people to assume she was a lesbian. In her autobiography, published in 2000, she strongly denied this, but admitted to having lesbian relationships.''[citation needed]

* Note, &quot;'''one''' brief affair&quot; became &quot;lesbian relationship'''s'''&quot; (plural).

Then it became just: 
* ''She has never remarried.''

Now, it's that she's:
*''&quot;'''openly''' bisexual&quot;''
but on the strength of 1 dubious cite that simply calls her &quot;bisexual&quot;.  

This article is demonstrating its bipolarity in a bad way.   Can we come to a reasonable consensus about her sexuality as revealed by reputable sources?

If she'd never made any statement about the issue, I'd prefer to mention her marriage and divorce, and leave it at that.  Why is it relevant to state that she never remarried?  Unless there's something we want readers to read between the lines about, maybe.  

But she ''has'' made a statement about it, in her 2000 autobiography, in which she acknowledged exactly one fling with another woman, but denied this made her a homosexual.  This needs to be stated.  '''She''' decides whether she's gay or not, not some website of dubious relevance or credibility, and she's said she's not.  Until she makes a different statement, or there's overwhelming evidence to the contrary, she remains non-homosexual as far as Wikipedia is concerned.  That would be my strongly preferred position. --  [[User:JackofOz|&lt;font face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;Jack of Oz&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:JackofOz#top|&lt;font face=&quot;Papyrus&quot;&gt;'' ... speak! ...

== Flag 'Stealing' ==
This article has Fraser stealing the flag, but unless my memory is ''very'' faulty, it was eventually revealed that she did ''not'' do so. A male swimmer she was with took it but she was caught and took the blame because you &quot;don't 'dob' on other people&quot; I recall this was revealed in an epsiode of the Australian version of  [[This Is Your Life (Australian TV series)|This Is Your Life]](TIYL). This was after Frasers' own TIYL episode where she was presented with the flag, still maintaining the story that she 'stole' it. - [[user:220.101.28.25|'''220.101''']] [[User talk:220.101.28.25|talk]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/220.101.28.25|\Contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:40, 29 September 2010 (UTC)

== Post-swimming ==

I'm placing some of the items that user Fetchcomms took it upon him/herself to remove some time ago. A request for sources would have been the decent thing to do - most if not all of the items deleted are easily sourced.

:The article referenced uses the word &quot;racist&quot; in the headline and Kyrgios publicly called her a &quot;blatant racist&quot; [http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/tennis/33421964] so I'm not sure &quot;xenophobic and inappropriate&quot; is sufficient here. With clear attribution, it's not POV to use the term racism/racist. - [[Special:Contributions/134.76.61.232|134.76.61.232]] ([[User talk:134.76.61.232|talk]]) 08:12, 7 July 2015 (UTC)Dawn Fraser has done Charitable works for Aboriginal Children all over Australia. She is praised by the Aboriginal community for her works To label her a racist for telling someone to go back to where they come from does not deserve to have her labeled a racist. Please remove this liable comment immediately! I am forwarding it to Dawn so that the appropriate legal action can be taken!

While helping aboriginal people is good, it merely shows she is a good person in relation to the first Australians. It does not mean she can't have ill-feeling towards other groups of people. A racist isn't me versus everybody, just me versus the groups I don't like. [[Special:Contributions/114.30.125.101|114.30.125.101]] ([[User talk:114.30.125.101|talk]]) 01:07, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

== Outspoken views on immigration ==

I think it would be good to have a discussion here on her publicly stated views about 'go back to where your parents came from' as 1) she is a high profile public speaker and 2) these views contradict her own example ( she had an immigrant father).
