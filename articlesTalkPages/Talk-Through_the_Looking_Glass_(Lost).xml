== Feedback on article ==

Here are some comments on the article.

&quot;Reviews... were universally positive&quot; Were there any negative reviews? I could imagine some people being disappointed if they expected a huge surprise.

&quot;The episode begins... 815, the survivors&quot; Two sentences joined by a comma.

The lead section mentions the capture of 3 losties but not their release.

&quot;The life of series protagonist is featured&quot; Perhaps better to say &quot;The secondary storyline features series protagonist...&quot;

The lead section does not mention the most significant things about the episode namely the innovative flashforward and the implication that Jack will escape the island.

&quot;Actor Dominic Monaghan makes his final appearance with main cast credit as Charlie Pace in this episode.&quot; - Dom was listed in the main credits in tonight's episode &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot;.  This line is now in error. [[User:Mshatzer|Mshatzer]] ([[User talk:Mshatzer|talk]]) 03:26, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

1.1 Background

&quot;Due to the length of the episode&quot; - are we sure that the length is what causes there to be no &quot;previously&quot; segment.

Perhaps &quot;the show does not begin with a &quot;previously on Lost&quot; segment&quot; would be better phrasing.

&quot;the mole... has decided&quot; I suggest a consistent use of simple past tense would be better throughout the section, for example &quot;the mole decided to work against the Others and befriended...&quot;.

&quot;Naomi has a satellite phone, however&quot; Perhaps better to start a new sentence for however. Also, the article could be clearer as to why the phone needs to be used near the radio tower.

We do not need as much detail on Desmond. &quot;Desmond, who could see glimses of the future, told the survivor&quot;

&quot;When Locke is about to relieve himself of his pain&quot; Better to say commit suicide.

1.4 The Looking Glass

&quot;making Desmond dive into the water&quot; Perhaps worth mentioning that Desmond is in a boat

&quot;He goes down to the Looking Glass&quot; Could be clearer that this is still Desmond.

Perhaps worth mentioning the sign of the cross made by Charlie

1.6 Flashforward

&quot;The story central to Jack&quot; Perhaps better to say &quot;the secondary storyline shows Jack depressed, unshaven...&quot;

&quot;Jack goes to the memorial service&quot; was it a formal service or something else?

&quot;branding him a local hero&quot; better would be &quot;making&quot;

Did Jack run out? If so, why?

&quot;Jack then turns to stealing the medication&quot; simpler would be &quot;Jack then steals&quot;

2 Production

&quot;show runners Damon L and Carlton C lent&quot; Perhaps producers would be better


&quot;Charlie escaped death, however&quot; new sentence for however?

&quot;producing the late second season&quot; should this be &quot;the latter part of the second seris&quot;?

&quot;enterring radio silence&quot; - perhaps add more on this. why did they enter it and why will they break it?

Some parts of the Production section did not seem to quite fit with the title. &quot;Monaghan felt relief&quot; &quot;Monaghan hopes to return&quot; Not sure how to remedy this.


Images

In order to reach FA standard, I think some people will want improved captions for the pictures. I have not read up on the rules but I think the idea of the caption is to give some brief description as if talking to someone who cannot see the picture.[[User:Eiler7|Eiler7]] 01:28, 21 July 2007 (UTC)

:Thank you for your many helpful suggestions.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Through_the_Looking_Glass_%28Lost%29&amp;diff=147593344&amp;oldid=146598607 I addressed most of them by making changes to the article.]  What I did not change is discussed below:
*All the reviews I found were positive, so I kept the &quot;universally positive&quot; statement.
*I didn't mention the cross made by Charlie because I don't think it is that important (this doesn't really matter to me if someone adds it).
*I kept the &quot;show runners&quot; term - there's a wikilink so people can learn what the term means (again, this doesn't bother me).
*I just realized that I accidentally skipped over the radio silence point and I will edit this in later.
*Kept the production part with Monaghan feelings.
*I strenghtened the captions, but some of the images will probably be removed.  (I would like to get rid of the Hoffs/Drawlar picture but that is the only one I did not upload so...)

== &quot;Twenty-second&quot; episode ==

The article begins ''&quot;'''Through the Looking Glass'''&quot; is the twenty-second episode and season finale...''  Maybe it's just me, but on initial reading I thought &quot;Wow! The finale is only twenty-two seconds long?!?!?&quot;  (yeah, yeah - I know it later says it ran for over two hours.)  Without being overly didactic, is there a way to reword the opening to remove the (admittedly momentary) cognitive dissonance the introductory phrase induces?

== Flashforward Error ==

The use of &quot;flashforwards&quot; to describe the off-island &quot;flashes&quot; in this episode seems misleading.  During one of these &quot;flashes&quot; a bleary eyed, stumbling Jack is confronted by his supervising surgeon about being drunk.  Jack states that if his father, who is upstairs, is less drunk than he, then go ahead and fire him.  Jack's father died prior to the plane crash.

== This should not be a featured article ==

This is a great article don't get me wrong. I understand it has all the requirements for a featured article, but it's about ONE episode from the series Lost. Shouldn't featured articles be texts that are more centralized to a specific topic as opposed to a single freakin' epsiode of an American television show? All I'm saying is that when I get on the Wikipedia's main page and see this as the featured article... it's a little disappointing. One, not everybody watches Lost, and two, this isn't genuinely educational. This should not be featured article.

Not that this shouldn't be notable, on the contrary, I think others should be too. For example the game World of Warcraft had articles about big parts of its gameplay. They were deleted. We're talking about a game with several million users, it probably spends more time to people that Lost does, yet its &quot;parts&quot; are &quot;less notable&quot;.

== Not FA material ==

This crufty article is really not FA material and is a good example of why individual shows should be merged into the main article on the series. While the article is comprehensive about the subject, it's not particularly well written. There isn't much prose to speak of. It's more like a random collection of facts strung together in overly long paragraphs. And the biggest problem is the Plot section. It's a string of events that occur in the show with no over arching relevancy. Since it is about a TV show and uses the subject as it's main source, over a third of the article is devoted to original research. The only reason I can see why this passed FA is that it's a popular show. [[Special:Contributions/198.203.177.177|198.203.177.177]] ([[User talk:198.203.177.177|talk]]) 14:10, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

this article should be deleted on the basis that it's non-notable fancruft. deleting front page featured articles is far from unprecedented, anyway. see, for example, [[Torchic]].  as [[Talk:Torchic]] reveals, Torchic serves as precedent.

: I agree. I'd also like to point out that [[User talk:Holdsgood]] has been banned for daring to disagree with this article's current status. As he points out, it is inappropriate for ''any'' episode to be featured on the front page when Wikipedia is so openly hostile to them.

Now, they're all transwiki'd, so that Jimbo Wales can [http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=382783&amp;cid=21616649 line his pockets with cash]. What makes [[List of Lost episodes]] different? Oh - that's right - nothing.  I'd like to finish off by quoting from the talk page of the article that Torchic now redirects to:

::by selectively applying &quot;policies&quot;, you're only going to result in ill-feelings. you're going to make people who thought their contributions were worthwhile feel resentment. you're going to turn them into vandals. how does that serve wikipedia? you can't tell these people not to take it personally because you ''are'' picking on them. are you actually having information obtained through hacking deleted on other non-pokemon articles? if not, you ''are'' picking on these people and it's not fair. it does a disservice to wikipedia and to new editors.
::and if you're not picking on these people, then prove it. go delete the sections of article i mentioned. show pokemon-fans that you're not ''just'' picking on them - that you're picking on everyone.
