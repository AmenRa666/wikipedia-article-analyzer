==Comments==
I am the proprietor of sacred-texts.com. The Holy Piby is located at my site and I believe it to be in the public domain in the United States because it was not registered or renewed in a timely fashion at the US Copyright office as required by law.

I have no objection to Wikipedia linking to it or quoting it.

Following is my proposed text for the Holy Piby Article:

The Holy Piby is a proto-Rastafarian sacred text which was written by [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]], who founded an [[Afrocentric]] religion in the US and West Indies in the 1920s. Rogers' religious movement, the Afro Athlican Constructive Church, saw Ethiopians (in the [[Biblical]] sense of Black [[Africans]]) as the chosen people of God, and proclaimed [[Marcus Garvey]], the prominent [[Black Nationalist]], an apostle. The church preached self-reliance and self-determination for Africans. 

The original is very rare. There are no copies listed in either the [[Library of Congress]] or the University of California catalogs, which is highly unusual. The Holy Piby was banned in [[Jamaica]] and other [[Caribbean Islands]] in the middle and late 1920s. Today the Holy Piby is acclaimed by many [[Rastafarians]] as a primary source.  --&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:63.249.108.58|63.249.108.58]] ([[User talk:63.249.108.58|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/63.249.108.58|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

&quot;In the late 2010s Holy Piby had a prominent ressurgence in southern-West European countries, namely in Portugal where several cover bands managed to fill some important venues such as Casa da Musica in Oporto.&quot;
This line seems to be describing an artist/band called &quot;Holy Piby&quot; rather than the Rastafarian text.

What is the pronunciation of &quot;Piby&quot;? [[User:Badagnani|Badagnani]] ([[User talk:Badagnani|talk]]) 22:41, 9 December 2008 (UTC)

I'd like to know too. &amp;mdash;[[User:JerryFriedman|JerryFriedman]]  [[User talk:JerryFriedman|(Talk)]] 21:27, 21 April 2009 (UTC)

==Anguilla and the Holy Piby==
It is worth mentioning that Rogers was born in Anguilla - Many Anguillian Rastafari take pride in this fact. [[User:Seir Corall|Seir Corall]] 03:45, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

==Birth date of author==
How could it have been &quot;banned in...Carribean islands...in the middle and late 1920's&quot; if the man who wrote it was &quot;b. 1931&quot;?
[[User:209.247.5.233|209.247.5.233]] 09:19, 24 August 2007 (UTC)

:Apparently, he died in 1931. [[User:Badagnani|Badagnani]] ([[User talk:Badagnani|talk]]) 22:42, 9 December 2008 (UTC)

== Holy Piby and Rastafarians ==

According to my sources (mainly about Rastafarians in Jamaica) the Holy Piby is never mentioned in connection with the Rastafarian movement. This may be different for Anguilla—I do not have any sources specific to this country. I think the influence of the Holy Piby to the Rastafarians should be formulated more specific and backed up with sources. [[User:Ras Makonnen|Ras Makonnen]] ([[User talk:Ras Makonnen|talk]]) 09:36, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

==Restoring a source==
In response to a [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion]] tag [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holy_Piby&amp;diff=728716523&amp;oldid=717943051 noting an absence of independent reliable sources in this article], I added a reference and footnote citing this book: {{cite book|author=Charles Price|title=Becoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OC399TZD2BwC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-6768-9|pages=48–49}}  

My addition was then removed by {{U|71.246.152.193}} , whose [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Holy_Piby&amp;diff=728743147&amp;oldid=728725656 edit summary objected] that my attempt at quickly summarizing the source's description of this relationship between the ''Holy Piby'' and Rastafarianism resulted in an inaccurate statement. 71.246's objection may be right; unfortunately it was expressed via the removal of a relevant and necessary source, rather than a proposal of alternative wording. Since then, other editors have repeatedly added and removed this edit.   I am here expressing the hope that we can instead mutually agree on language.

The source describes the ''Holy Piby'' and two other books and states, in part, that these &quot;three important Ethiopianist-oriented texts, influenced the early Rastafari.&quot; My proposed text said that these 3 books are &quot;today recognized as a root document of Rastafari thought&quot;, which I still think is a reasonable restatement of the source--and I note that similar statements can be found in other sources--but I am not certainly wedded to this language.  I do think it's important to include the source, however, and, indeed, the article needs more such reliable sources explaining the relevance of this book and its connection to the others.   I propose the following:

:::Together with the ''[[Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy]]'' by [[Fitz Balintine Pettersburg]] and [[Leonard P. Howell]]'s ''[[The Promise Key]]'', the ''Holy Piby'' influenced the development of early Rastafarianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Price|title=Becoming Rasta: Origins of Rastafari Identity in Jamaica|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OC399TZD2BwC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-6768-9|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::::{{Reflist}}

If anyone thinks this is still not right, please suggest something better. --[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 00:32, 12 July 2016 (UTC)
