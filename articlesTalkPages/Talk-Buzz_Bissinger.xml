Piers Morgan featured a panel on his CNN program including Daily Beast sports columnist Buzz Bissinger and commentator Abby Huntsman in which Buzz joked about how Piers should invite radio host Alex Jones to a boxing match and “pop” him with an “assault rifle.”  To which Abby Huntsman laughingly responded, “I’d love to see that, in uniform!”  Piers remarked that he'd borrow his brother's uniform.  William Gheen, president of ALIPAC, called Morgan’s segment one of the worst he’s seen in his career.  “Monitoring the media is something I have done professionally for two decades now, and in that entire time I have never seen anything as outrageous as the Piers Morgan segment joking about killing one of their guests with an ‘assault rifle’.” There is an outstanding White House petition with 2300 (now over 3000) signatures to investigate this veiled threat to the person and family of Alex Jones under Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241.

What soapboxing?  This is a factual account of his statements on a major broadcast network, which is also probably a first in the annals of television.  Wikipedia factually details death threats received by such people as [[Barack Obama]], [[Jerome Hughes]], and [[Kathy Sierra]], even 'insignificant' ones where people were apparently joking around and overheard.  Why shouldn't it detail this one?  Let the readers decide whether it is serious or not; it's not up to Wikipedia editors to determine the seriousness, or lack thereof, of a media personality's comments (or intents) on controversial topics.  Wikipedia is a digital encyclopedia, as such there is no need to omit notable factual information for the sake of brevity.

[[:H. G. Bissinger]] → {{no redirect|Buzz Bissinger}} – Per [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. I have only ever seen him referred to as &quot;Buzz&quot;.

::Slight correction, he was credited as &quot;H. G.&quot; in the credits of [[Friday Night Lights (film)]] (just happened to catch the end of it on cable this weekend).

No further edits should be made to this section.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- Template:RM bottom --&gt;

== Lutheran Background ==

The editor who mentioned Bissinger's father's &quot;Lutheran background&quot; linked to the wrong Harry Gerard Bissinger.  Both Bissingers were born in Philadelphia in 1903, but Buzz's maternal grandmother was Gertrude Kaufman, not Hester Hatch, as evidenced here: http://www.neilpiwovar.com/genealogy/tngfiles912/getperson.php?personID=I47883&amp;tree=tree1

Buzz's father's obituary mentions a half-brother named Eli Kaufman:
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/01/business/h-gerard-bissinger-ii-75-former-bond-firm-president.html

Going through Buzz's family tree, I'm 98% certain he's fully Jewish on both sides.  Buzz also describes himself as a &quot;neurotic Jew&quot; on his website: http://www.buzzbissinger.com/books/ and he was inducted into Philadelphia's Jewish Sports Hall of Fame: http://blacktiemagazine.com/US_Society/Philadelphia_Jewish_Sports_Hall_of_Fame.htm

I'll leave it to others to decide whether those sources are strong enough for him to be counted as Jewish per Wikipedia standards.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/198.8.34.218|198.8.34.218]] ([[User talk:198.8.34.218|talk]]) 16:47, 9 March 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Balance ==

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now, let's be sure no one will think i know jack about Bissinger -- i was pretty sure ''FNL'' was about yank footie, and probably small-town Texas, but on hearing him interviewed today by [[Dave Davies (reporter)|Dave Davies]] (standing in for [[Terry Gross]]?) i was disproportionately surprised that BB's ''name'' meant nothing to me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Our coverage strikes me as (perhaps homophobically) obsessed with his having &quot;questioned his sexuality in the past and ... experimented with men&quot;, to the exclusion of his (self-describedly) life-threatening risk-taking (and perhaps to the neglect of his profligate leather habit) -- and for that matter the exclusion/neglect of his apparent dedication to the welfare of his [[wikt:family of procreation|family (of procreation)]]. IMO it desperately needs [[WP:curation]] by colleagues who (in contrast to me) will in 24 hours still give a damn about the topic.&lt;br&gt;--[[User:Jerzy|Jerzy]]•[[User talk:Jerzy|t]] 18:54, 3 August 2015 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
:The thing about his sexuality is one sentence, and perfectly balanced. That said, there may be important details that aren't included in this article that should be. I don't know him well enough; I only watchlisted the article when he wrote about his shopping and sexuality to monitor for vandalism. By all means, {{u|Jerzy}}, add whatever you think should be added before those 24 hours are up and you no longer care. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Muboshgu|Muboshgu]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Muboshgu#top|talk]]) 19:16, 3 August 2015 (UTC)
::&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That's a fully adequate response, a fair retort to my unfair insinuation, a worthy challenge, and an invitation that deserves a serious response. That said, no promise, and perhaps actually no time limit. [smile]&lt;br&gt;--[[User:Jerzy|Jerzy]]•[[User talk:Jerzy|t]] 19:40, 3 August 2015 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
:::Heh. One of the best things about Wikipedia is that [[Wikipedia:There is no deadline|there is no deadline]]. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Muboshgu|Muboshgu]]&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Muboshgu#top|talk]]) 19:49, 3 August 2015 (UTC)
::::&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Amen, and i'll go read that WP doc.&lt;br&gt;--[[User:Jerzy|Jerzy]]•[[User talk:Jerzy|t]] 20:07, 3 August 2015 (UTC)&lt;br&gt;
