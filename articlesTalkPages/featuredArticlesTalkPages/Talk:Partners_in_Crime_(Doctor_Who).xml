== What needs doin' ==

Now someone decided (without discussion, maybe...) to create the article, I'm going to sketch out a rough to-do list for it, if I may.
*Find sources for cast... ''Sarah Lancashire (Miss Foster), Claudio Laurini (Miss Fosters guard), Bernard Cribbins (Wilf, Donna's Grandad), Jacqueline King (Sylvia, Donna's Mum), Steve Braham, Howard Attfield (Geoff, Donna's Dad)'' according to the forum; we ought to source as many as possible.
*Picture from trailer, probably the &quot;spark of life&quot; frame, once we've confirmed Sarah Lancashire for this episode.
*Synopsis/extract from ''Newsround'' (RTD says &quot;strangest ever aliens&quot;).
*Ensure that no start-date is added until we know the start-date!
How's that? &lt;small style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;size:95%;color:#2F74FF&quot;&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#FFFFFF;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User:TreasuryTag|TreasuryTag]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:TreasuryTag|t]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[Special:Contributions/TreasuryTag|c]]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 17:18, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
:#DWN's guest stars are Lancashire, Verona Joseph, Chandra Ruegg, Jessica Gunning, Martin Ball, King, and Cribbins (DWM 393, page 10, &quot;30 reasons to be excited about Series 30!&quot;)
:#See above
:#RTD says something about the aliens and the special effects in the same column.
:#Only two more days to wait... '''[[User:Sceptre|Will]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Sceptre|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 17:23, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
:::Point 3... plus ''Newsround'' - we've got plenty to go on, then! I'll get working afterwards. Point 4... so we hope! &lt;small style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;size:95%;color:#2F74FF&quot;&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#FFFFFF;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User:TreasuryTag|TreasuryTag]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:TreasuryTag|t]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[Special:Contributions/TreasuryTag|c]]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 19:20, 18 March 2008 (UTC)

== Cast Notes and Production ==

Is there any reason why these two sections were cut?--[[User:Wiggstar69|Wiggs]] ([[User talk:Wiggstar69|talk]]) 23:27, 18 March 2008 (UTC)

:None of the production information was specific to the episode, and the cast info only mentioned that they appeared in earlier episodes, which isn't realy worth mentioning. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: verdana;&quot;&gt; — [[User:Edokter|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008;&quot;&gt;'''''E''dokter'''&lt;/span&gt;]] • [[User_talk:Edokter|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #080;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]] • &lt;/span&gt; 23:50, 18 March 2008 (UTC)

can we start on the other ones yet??? --[[Special:Contributions/82.21.22.241|82.21.22.241]] ([[User talk:82.21.22.241|talk]]) 16:00, 19 March 2008 (UTC)
:I've done the next one, that'll do for starters, I reckon. Have two future episodes at any one time, maybe. &lt;small style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;size:95%;color:#2F74FF&quot;&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#FFFFFF;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User:TreasuryTag|TreasuryTag]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:TreasuryTag|t]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[Special:Contributions/TreasuryTag|c]]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 21:20, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

==Hearsay==
The article has today been semi-d (at my request) for three days, due to the absurd amount of trivial non-info from anons. I suggest that we keep a very close eye out after that period's ended, as this is likely to get worse, not better. &lt;small style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;size:95%;color:#2F74FF&quot;&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#FFFFFF;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User:TreasuryTag|TreasuryTag]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:TreasuryTag|t]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[Special:Contributions/TreasuryTag|c]]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 21:20, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

===Straw poll to gauge support===
Do you support the current image, one showing Wilf and Donna, with its caption, and do you think that it is compliant with the numerous copyright, non-free content and fair use policies in force on Wikipedia?
#'''Yes'''. &lt;small style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;size:95%;color:#2F74FF&quot;&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#FFFFFF;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User:TreasuryTag|TreasuryTag]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[User talk:TreasuryTag|t]]'''&lt;/small&gt;—&lt;small style=&quot;background:#DBDBDB;border:#EB8500 1px solid;padding:0px 3px 1px 4px&quot;&gt;'''[[Special:Contributions/TreasuryTag|c]]'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 20:18, 25 March 2008 (UTC)
#'''Yes'''. Passes #4 (cinema trailer counts as publication), passes #8 if we can talk about Donna's and Wilf's previous interactions with the Doctor (which is why I think this picture is better than Sarah Lancashire). '''[[User:Sceptre|Sceptre]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Sceptre|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 20:21, 25 March 2008 (UTC)
#*This argument reads like &quot;''[[WP:ILIKEIT]] and here's how we alter the article to justify its inclusion''&quot;.

#'''No'''.  [[WP:NFCC#1]] requires that the media be irreplaceable with prose; the characters presented are engaged in nothing that cannot be described otherwise, being &quot;representative of the episode's plot as a whole&quot; is a purpose best accomplished by a description of such.  [[WP:NFCC#3a]] requires the media be used only if necessary; such necessity has not been established.  [[WP:NFCC#8]] requires that the media &quot;significantly increase readers' understanding of the topic, [and have] its omission [...] be detrimental to that understanding;&quot; I understand the article [[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)]] well w/o the two caucasoids and their hats; sans the image, the article conveys exactly the same information.  —  '''[[User:pd_THOR|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#CC0000;&quot;&gt;pd_THOR&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;|''' [[User_talk:pd_THOR|=/\=]]'''&lt;/sup&gt; | 20:43, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

===Voting is evil (and in this case, irrelevant)===
Votes are bad, and regardless, this is not an issue for which a vote can be taken, any more than one can vote on whether or not an article should be NPOV&amp;mdash;the answer is always &quot;yes&quot;, even if a vote or discussion says &quot;no&quot;. In this case, the vote is whether an image can be used, when it is not ''critical'' for understanding. It is not, and the concept of the episode can be conveyed by text alone, so both the Foundation's resolution and our nonfree content policies are clear, and it must be removed.

I do not even care about ''this'' picture, as it is only there temporary; by the time this discussion is over, the episode has long aired.

Of course, you could also respond to the core of my proposal: The presence of that field in the infobox serves to promote the misunderstanding that there is a blanket allowance of one arbitrary non-free image per episode article. Which there isn't. Every image has to be individually justified; long-standing consensus (well, outside the narrow confines of the TV wikiprojects, probably) is that this can only happen in conjunction with analytical commentary in the text; infoboxes lead editors to just paste in whatever image comes to hand without such textual embedding. In the (rare, IMO) cases where an image is truly needed for analytical purposes, it can just as well be placed freely in the text.

Just like to point out that this is not so cut-and-dried because of the fact that it's from a promotional material that's edited from the actual episode, in which case, to comply with fair use, the caption should mention something to that effect as it's not readily obvious (see [[Dracula (1931 film)]] for use of promotional material). As an image depicting the episode proper (as opposed to the promotional material), it's merely decorative as it isn't really used to illustrate anything that can't be said within a sentence. Now if the image were a cast photo or an image of alien creatures or spaceships, something that can't be easily picture through words, then it'll probably fall under the category of important.

And to respond to the above, no one &quot;gave&quot; me the authority to say so. However, the Wikimedia Foundation, which ''does'' have authority which supersedes yours, mine, or even the authority of any type of consensus (which yes or no votes don't establish anyway), clearly stated that use of nonfree material must be minimal. Allowing it &quot;by category&quot; and using it when it is effectively a pretty for the infobox and is not essential for understanding is ''maximal'' use. No one has presented an argument that the image is critical to a reader's understanding. (Remember, just &quot;helpful&quot; to such understanding is not enough.) It's the same type of thing as NPOV. The Foundation has mandated that all mainspace material on every Wikimedia project must be presented in a neutral point of view, no exceptions. We could not hold a vote on whether to instead present this article from a fan's point of view&amp;mdash;even if a strong consensus formed to do so, it would be disallowed by that requirement. The same here. Decorative nonfree images are forbidden in ''all'' cases, and consensus, polls, or anything else will not overrule that, least not unless the person voting also happens to be on the Board.

:In this instance, I am inclined to agree with inclusion (and you guys know I'm otherwise among the most critical about episode images). If the introduction of computer-animated cute little blobs is such a notable new feature in this episode, let us see them. It really makes the coverage more informative. What I object to, much more strongly, are those items where you just see a couple of guys talking and the like. It also makes it easier to accept such images if the accompanying text is actually encyclopedic. ''&quot;The technology will be used to animate the Adipose, as they are born and move around London.&quot;'' is a decent start for an encyclopedic treatment. ''&quot;But most of all: how can they stop the onslaught of the foetus-like Adipose?&quot;'' is not. Unfortunately, the Dr Who crowd has had a tendency for the style of the latter.

: I'm personally not convinced that it cannot be described with text alone. The CGI is paltry at best and has no detail that text couldn't describe.

Mrs Foster mentions the Shadow Proclamation, suspecting that the Doctor and Donna are working for, or reporting to them/it. Obviously, we've heard the term before (in &quot;Rose&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;), so it should probably be noted in a &quot;Continuity&quot; section. I'm just not sure how best to go about it, so I'll leave it to someone else. I'd guess &quot;Shadow Proclamation&quot; is the Series Four &quot;code word&quot; too, although that's Original Research of course, so we don't need to add that. :) [[User:Kelvingreen|Kelvingreen]] ([[User talk:Kelvingreen|talk]]) 19:03, 5 April 2008 (UTC)

Since it would appear Tate actually said &quot;level pegging&quot; and that is not necessarily the same as &quot;equal&quot; should that be reverted back to the original even if &quot;equal&quot; reads better?

== Continuity Error ==

OK, I'm new to this, so please forgive me my slowness. I believe I have found a continuity error in the episode that I believe should be mentioned in this article. Can I have some advice on where in the article to put it? (I put it in once, and it was removed as &quot;vandalism&quot;).
Basically, at 26mins 51secs into the episode, Miss Foster cuts one of the cables of the lift, but when the shot shifts to the lift itself, it's the other cable that severs. [[User:Masterflea|Masterflea]] ([[User talk:Masterflea|talk]]) 13:24, 27 April 2008 (UTC)

==Why are we repeating information on this page==
I have removed the following two paragraphs [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Partners_in_Crime_%28Doctor_Who%29&amp;diff=211529388&amp;oldid=211528756] from this page based on a couple of things. First, the Doctor Who wikiprojects own guidelines seen here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Doctor_Who#Episodes] state that the lead section is to be kept brief. Second, both of these paragraphs mention things that are repeated later in the article. The returning cast members is mentioned in &quot;casting&quot; and the use of Massive is mentioned in &quot;Adipose&quot;. This is the proper spot for the mention of each of these items - the opening is not. Repeating information makes the pages read poorly. Also, it is not something that has been done on Doctor Who episode releated articles up until now. If the standards for our articles have changed please explain the shift in them. Also please point out where these shifts are mentioned in the Manual of Style. [[User:MarnetteD|MarnetteD]] | [[User talk:MarnetteD|Talk]] 21:14, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

==Constant mentioning of actors names==
Beginning with this episode editors are adding the actors names to the plot synopsis and sometimes to other sections below this. This means that we have to read redundant info two or three times. This is not something that has been done before nor is it part of the Doctor Who wikiprojects MoS. When Sceptre reverted my removals of them his edit summaries as seen here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Fires_of_Pompeii&amp;diff=211462522&amp;oldid=211421420] he claims that there are ongoing discussions about this at the TV project and the Doctor Who project. This is a bit misleading to say the least. Before today the only &quot;discussion&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Doctor_Who#Use_of_cast_names_INSIDE_synopses] had one editor stating that they are not needed. Please note that both Treasury Tag's and my statements were added today. I have been through several pages at the television wikiproject and can find no &quot;discussion' about it anywhere. That doesn't mean that there isn't one so, if there is, please direct me to one that &quot;started before&quot; today. It should also be noted that policy changes are usually discussed (though not always) before implementing new standards to the MoS.

:First of all... you are aware I hope that this article became a '''featured''' article in it's current form. Removing parts from the lead, which is ''supposed'' to summarise the rest of the article, could severely damage that status. So please stop removing the Adipose paragraphs from the lead. Second... putting the actor names in the article puts them into context without having to fly to the infobox every time. I don't know if the several MoS-es encourage it or not, but agressively removing them is getting dangerously close to edit warring. In any event, they do no harm... and remember, this is a featured article (can't stress that enough). &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: verdana;&quot;&gt; — [[User:Edokter|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008;&quot;&gt;'''''E''dokter'''&lt;/span&gt;]] • [[User_talk:Edokter|&lt;span style=&quot;color: #080;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]] • &lt;/span&gt; 22:43, 10 May 2008 (UTC)

::Unfortuantely that just goes to show that becoming a featured article does not mean all that much. Especially when the decision making is up to so few. I have seen featured articles that numerous editors have worked on lose that status when the next wave of enthusistic new editors  decide to take Wikipedia in a new direction. Just pray that TTN and his allies never stray into our pages after his topic ban expires. 

::As to the particulars of this page the two paragraphs in the lead in question do not &quot;summarize&quot; items in the article. They repeat, virtually word for word, what is stated later. I can find no other lead section before or after this episodes which contain so much production detail in such a repetitive form. Next, I did not remove the Adipose paragraph&quot;s&quot;. I removed the one that was cluttering up the lead section and left the one in the Adipose section intact.

::Next, putting the actors names in the article has not been in our, or any other MoS. We have 26 classic series seasons, one TV film and 3 seasons plus 3 Xmas specials which do not list the actors in this fashion. Thus, it is not hard to see why a reader would wonder why the change happened without consensus being reached first. The edit warring has been going on from both sides and I have stopped removing them awaiting this consensus. You also did not look deeply enough to understand what I was commenting on. If the Doctor Who wikiproject decides to add them to our manual of style then so be it. But to claim that the reason for leaving them in was because their inclusion was being discussed on various talk pages flies in the face of the facts and makes it difficult to [[WP:AGF]] while being reverted. 

::One last point are you saying that [[WP:BOLD]] no longer applies once an article has become &quot;featured&quot;. Does that mean that the editors that have worked on it now get to [[WP:OWN]] it and the only improvements on readability are by those who can't see its imperfections. I take as much pride in Wikipedia's Doctor Who pages as anyone and I think that everyone involved in this discussion, which has too much crankiness going on in it from all sides, including mine, is missing the point.

:::::Let us look at a few facts about the FA discussion. First it looks like about 13 editors made some sort of comment and of those only four editors wrote in a support vote (these could be of by an editor or two.) I know that Sceptre should be counted as a support as he was and is doing a great deal of work to improve these articles so that makes five. The programme aired April 5th and the FA discussion was closed April 20th. This is before the show had even aired in the US. Thirteen editors (some of whom may not even have seen the episode) commenting over 12 days is hardly representative of the &quot;wikipedia community&quot;. I doubt that some of the items in question would stand up to a more rigorous scrutiny. This is a prime example of why FA status, which may look good on our stats, does not actually mean that much. Perhaps reopening the FA and announcing it on the talk pages for the Doctor Who wikiproject and the TV wikiproject might actually get some feedback that could actually turn this into a feature article that everyone could be proud of.

The bracketed actors' names is a standard in TV episode FAs. See [[200 (Stargate SG-1)]], [[Abyssinia, Henry]], [[Pilot (House)]], [[Pilot (Smallville)]].
