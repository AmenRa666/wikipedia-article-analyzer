The article: [[Skyscraper]] conflicts with this article, citing [[Philadelphia City Hall]] as the tallest masonry load-bearing building in the world.  Is there a distiction made in this article that I'm missing, or is someone simply wrong? --[[User:Woodardj|Woodardj]] 17:33, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
:I noticed this too. The PCH article states that the building is much taller, so perhaps the author of this article is just wrong. Should it not be changed? [[User:72.196.104.129|72.196.104.129]] 09:07, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
::I am fairly certain that this article is wrong. Whilst the Monadnock may be *one* of the tallest masonry buildings in the world, I severely doubt it is the winner of that honour. The cited source also fails to verify the claim. I'll amend as appropriate. Cheers, [[User:DWaterson|DWaterson]] 10:47, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;Neighboring buildings&quot; ==

This section is quite important and is pretty well done.  I'd add something about the building on the SWC of Washington and Dearborn (across from the Daley Center, to the Miro's right, exactly half a mile north of the Monadnock) [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=41.883205,-87.629496&amp;sll=41.884068,-87.629582&amp;sspn=0.002392,0.006046&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.883004,-87.629673&amp;spn=0.001196,0.003023&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=41.883205,-87.629463&amp;panoid=IrmP5xnLy8BJAbpxvLnxdw&amp;cbp=12,235,,0,-11.83 Google Street View]  It's &quot;common knowledge&quot; that the curve near the base of the building (shown on GSV) is a nod to the Monadnock's curve at the base.  Don't know where a reliable source is yet, but ...

== &quot;Rand McNally diagram in Early History&quot; ==
The description of the diagram cited a 1999 source that only the Monadnock remained of the great buildings in the diagram.  This is not true.  The building marked #10 is the Fisher building, which is still standing.  Behind it, unnumbered, is the still standing Old Colony Building.  And the unmarked low building at the SE corner of Jackson and Dearborn is also still standing. But it is true that the buildings marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, and 9 have all been demolished.  But because 1 other numbered building is still standing, the statement was incorrect and its deletion was justified.  [[User:Icebox93|Icebox93]] ([[User talk:Icebox93|talk]]) 10:39, 7 November 2011 (UTC)
:Actually, the building marked #10 is the Boyleston Building, built in 1875 and presumably demolished to make room for the Fisher Building in 1896 (see Rand McNally, p. 187). That same source, however, confirms that the building to the immediate south is the Old Colony (owned by the same interests that built the Boyleston, it seems), which is in fact still standing. I'm fine with the edit, although I would prefer something like &quot;of the buildings Rand McNally considered notable at the time, only the Monadnock is standing&quot;. That's what the Randall source you deleted said. And it seems an interesting (albeit quite minor ) point. --[[User:Nasty Housecat|Nasty Housecat]] ([[User talk:Nasty Housecat|talk]]) 16:44, 7 November 2011 (UTC)

== Philadelphia City Hall claim ==
Regarding the reversion of my edits to this claim by {{USER|Michaelmalak}}, I moved it to a footnote because that fact is not mentioned in the body of the article and so does not belong in the lead [[WP:MOSINTRO]]. The footnote to which I moved it specifically addresses the tallest masonry building claim, and it is the only place in the article that does. The City Hall claim is most helpful there, since it clarifies that the Monadnock is the tallest &lt;u&gt;commercial&lt;/u&gt; masonry building, but not the tallest of &lt;u&gt;all&lt;/u&gt; masonry buildings.

The City Hall claim also surely requires a citation, wherever it goes. It took more effort than you would think to find a [[WP:RS | reliable source]], but I found one and provided it, but the reversion deleted it (so please don't do that again).

Finally, the reversion also deleted a number of fixes I made to the citation format in the footnotes, which I took some trouble to do. Please be more careful with your revisions so that they do not wholesale remove things you do not mean to remove.

I have reverted the edit to restore what was I assume in good faith inadvertently deleted. I would ask that we please discuss these edits here before changing them again.

: Suggest promoting from footnote to inline and place in both body and lead. Article is currently misleading. [[User:Michaelmalak|Michaelmalak]] ([[User talk:Michaelmalak|talk]]) 15:49, 18 January 2016 (UTC)

:: I agree the claim is not clear. Looking at the source again, the claim is the Monadnock is the tallest free-standing &lt;u&gt;brick&lt;/u&gt; structure in the world (the north half, anyway), which I think is what made it interesting at the time, and underscores the fact that it was the &lt;u&gt;last&lt;/u&gt; all-brick skyscraper every built. I edited the lead accordingly.
:: The City Hall comparison is interesting for clarity, but not central to the article, I think. I edited the note to clarify that Monadnock is the tallest of its type, but not the tallest of &lt;u&gt;any&lt;/u&gt; type, a distinction that belongs to City Hall.
