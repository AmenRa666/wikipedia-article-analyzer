== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[4chan]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=700910201 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Attempted to fix sourcing for http://www.observer.com/2011/tech/creator-4chan-comes-more-mature-canvas

When you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the ''checked'' parameter below to '''true''' to let others know.

== [[Alt-right]] ==

Reference source: http://fusion.net/story/223175/uncuck-the-right-alt-right-youtube/
Reference source statements: &quot;He says he’s been posting in /pol/, the 4chan and 8chan’s anarchic, often right-leaning “Politically Incorrect” boards, for years. But his decision to get more actively involved with the alt right came this summer “when the cuckservative meme became big and the Alt Right started to explode.”&quot;
&quot;The tragedy of the situation, if you can call it that, is that UTR and his alt right pals are fighting a war that only exists in their heads and /pol/ threads.&quot;
Requested statement to add into article on /pol/: Members of the [[alt-right]] particularly use the /pol/ of image boards such as 4chan and [[8chan]].
:One person (referred to in the article as &quot;the creator of Uncuck the Right&quot;) is not &quot;members&quot; (plural). That's misrepresentation of a source. It's also an unreliable source. [[User:Sundayclose|Sundayclose]] ([[User talk:Sundayclose|talk]]) 02:56, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
&lt;s&gt;::No, it's not misrepresentation because it mentioned that the alt-right uses /pol/. How is it unreliable? [[User:Connor Machiavelli|Connor Machiavelli]] ([[User talk:Connor Machiavelli|talk]]) 03:00, 6 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
:::How is one person considered &quot;members&quot; (plural). Explain that or drop this topic. [[User:Sundayclose|Sundayclose]] ([[User talk:Sundayclose|talk]]) 03:10, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
&lt;s&gt;::::I didn't mean anything illogical, like one person being considered multiple, but rather something else which is similar in meaning. I was referring to how the source said the popular alt-right movement adherent, UTR, is a big poster on /pol/, and how it mentions &quot;alt-right pals&quot; are also on /pol/ with him, he's a big figure in the alt-right, and logically this means the requested statement is true, so it should be included for the article in the /pol/ section here.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Connor Machiavelli|Connor Machiavelli]] ([[User talk:Connor Machiavelli|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Machiavelli|contribs]]) 03:17, 6 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;&lt;/s&gt;

&lt;s&gt;::::::I never said or did that. [[User:Connor Machiavelli|Connor Machiavelli]] ([[User talk:Connor Machiavelli|talk]]) 03:30, 6 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
:There seems to be something of an obsession with adding this, even if it involves misrepresenting the sourcing. The source says &quot;He says he’s been posting in /pol/, the 4chan and 8chan’s anarchic, often right-leaning “Politically Incorrect” boards, for years.&quot; This is one person, and cannot be used to infer a general case. So it has been rightly reverted again.--'''''[[User:ianmacm|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#88b;color:#cff;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;♦Ian&lt;span style=&quot;background:#99c&quot;&gt;Ma&lt;span style=&quot;background:#aad&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;M♦&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:ianmacm|(talk to me)]]&lt;/sup&gt;''''' 08:30, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
::And of course it violates [[WP:UNDUE]]. When multiple reliable sources back this it might be time to use it, but not now. [[User:Doug Weller|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#070&quot;&gt;Doug Weller&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Doug Weller|talk]] 12:10, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
&lt;s&gt;:::I can agree with Doug Weller on that. The other quote said my point anyways. On inference from the first quote, you can infer from a big figure in the alt-right being at the /pol/ on imageboards that others in the alt-right would be there, since /pol/ is what they're all about, and /pol/ is a highly popular board, the alt-right being politically incorrect is backed up by everything out there on the [[alt-right]]. At least, it's a very high probability that they'd be there, and there particularly on those boards.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Connor Machiavelli|Connor Machiavelli]] ([[User talk:Connor Machiavelli|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Connor Machiavelli|contribs]]) 15:04, 6 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
::::A high probability does not indicate proof. If the source does not directly mention the fact that there is a population of the alt-right on /pol/, then it doesn't support it, regardless of the actual situation one observes on /pol/ (which would be original research). [[User:Al:cherin|Alcherin]] ([[User talk:Alcherin|talk]]) 15:07, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
&lt;s&gt;:::::Read the source. [[User:Connor Machiavelli|Connor Machiavelli]] ([[User talk:Connor Machiavelli|talk]]) 15:11, 6 March 2016 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;

::::::::This is hard to prove, because it is generally difficult to know who posted anything on 4chan. The site is anarchic, loosely moderated and allows anonymous posts. Linking 4chan posts to a real world identity is less than an exact science, probably even less so than linking Wikipedia user names to a real life identity. 4channers rarely say things like &quot;Hi, I'm John Smith of alt-right&quot;. 4chan does have a tendency to bias towards right wing viewpoints (some people would say that this is putting it mildly) but the alt-right connection still has problems with [[WP:DUE]].--'''''[[User:ianmacm|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#88b;color:#cff;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;♦Ian&lt;span style=&quot;background:#99c&quot;&gt;Ma&lt;span style=&quot;background:#aad&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;M♦&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:ianmacm|(talk to me)]]&lt;/sup&gt;''''' 15:32, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
::::::I looked carefully and there does not seem to be reliable sources to make this point. I think, in terms of original research, you are probably correct, but reliable sources have not connected the alt-right and /pol/ yet. The closest is some sources that connect the alt-right with [[cuckservative]], and some other sources that connect [[cuckservative]] with /pol/. However, that's synthesis, so I think we should we wait on this point for the time being. [[User:Denarivs|Denarivs]] ([[User talk:Denarivs|talk]]) 02:29, 7 March 2016 (UTC)

:The citation is from a rather dubious source too. The larger problem however, has been the successful recasting of the story by Gawker and it's media allies.
