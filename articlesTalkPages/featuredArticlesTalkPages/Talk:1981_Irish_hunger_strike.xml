[[:1981 Irish hunger strike]] → {{no redirect|?}} – First hunger strike occurred in 1980. Second occurred in 1981. Should the title be [[1980 and 1981 Irish hunger strike]]? Since incidents occurred in Northern Ireland, change &quot;Irish&quot; to &quot;Northern Irish&quot; or &quot;Northern Ireland&quot;? &lt;small&gt;--'''Relisted.''' [[User:BrownHairedGirl|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#663200;&quot;&gt;Brown&lt;/span&gt;HairedGirl]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:BrownHairedGirl|(talk)]] • ([[Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl|contribs]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:21, 10 May 2014 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 09:09, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

*'''Question'''. Did these hunger strikes overlap into one bigger hunger strike, or were they just two separate hunger strikes that were close in chronology? [[User:Twyfan714|Twyfan714]] ([[User talk:Twyfan714|talk]]) 00:29, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:: The first strike lasted until December 1980. Second started on March 1981. IRA members were still in prison during the three-month gap of both strikes. --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 01:07, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
::*'''Mildly support'''. While I think it is a bit of stretch to talk about the connection between the two strikes (which is just the IRA members in prison), in the end, they practically overlap, so I'd say merge into two. I also support moving it to &quot;Northern Irish&quot; as well. [[User:Twyfan714|Twyfan714]] ([[User talk:Twyfan714|talk]]) 12:55, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::* Maybe IRA instead of &quot;Northern Irish&quot;? --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 20:42, 1 May 2014 (UTC)
:::::Hmm...that depends. If just members of the IRA were involved, then I'd say yes. Otherwise, that would be a no. [[User:Twyfan714|Twyfan714]] ([[User talk:Twyfan714|talk]]) 21:04, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' the 1981 hunger strike is the important one as it resulted in 10 deaths.  Moving it to IRA should be opposed as it included members of the [[INLA]], including 3 of the 10 deaths. [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] ([[User talk:PatGallacher|talk]]) 15:20, 2 May 2014 (UTC)
:::There seem to be several questions that will determine whether or not this should be moved and if so, what it should be moved to:
::::1) Were these two separate strikes or were they linked in some way? 

::::In this case, per [[User:George Ho|George Ho]] (assuming he is correct), they were separated by three months, but during that time, some members of the IRA were in prison when it occurred. While that is a bit of a stretch, imo, it has enough to where it could warrant a move, but I could definitely see why one would be opposed.

::::2) Did either of the strikes involve just the IRA, or were others involved? 

::::Assuming [[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] is correct, then that would be the latter. With that in mind, it shouldn't be moved to anything with &quot;IRA&quot; in the title.

::::3) Did the strikes solely occur in Northern Ireland? 

::::If they did, then the title should be moved to Northern Ireland. If that is not the case, then it shouldn't be moved to that title.

::::4) Was the first strike in 1980 [[WP:NOTABLE|notable]] enough to be included? 

::::[[User:PatGallacher|PatGallacher]] seems to imply that the one in 1981 was more famous and notable than the one in 1980. This then raises the question of the notability of the first strike.

::::Seems like until these questions are answered, we cannot get a solid consensus on this. [[User:Twyfan714|Twyfan714]] ([[User talk:Twyfan714|talk]]) 18:03, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''. The title as it stands is fairly clunky but any of the alternatives proposed – expanding &quot;Irish&quot; to &quot;Northern Irish&quot; or &quot;1981&quot; to &quot;1980 and 1981&quot; – would only make it clunkier, without making the topic of the article any clearer.  [[User:Scolaire|Scolaire]] ([[User talk:Scolaire|talk]]) 16:49, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' I think the focus of the article is mainly around the 1981 hunger strike. Yes, there was a hunger strike in 1980, but this seems to be more of a precursor to the 1981 strike. Maybe the 1980 section could be merged into the &quot;background&quot; section.

== Thatcher's secret dealings with the IRA? ==

I found articles discussing the matter. The article is currently Featured, so this may affect its status. Links: [http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/17/northernireland][http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/30/deal-ira-hunger-strike-press][http://republican-news.org/current/news/2013/05/ira_leaders_divided_on_armed_s.html#.U19svIdOW70][http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/secret-thatcher-ira-memos-as-early-as-1986-1-5974455][http://www.newsuk24.com/news/secret-thatcher-ira-memos-early-1986/related] --[[User:George Ho|George Ho]] ([[User talk:George Ho|talk]]) 09:22, 29 April 2014 (UTC)

:Secret? Not really. The release of supposedly &quot;secret&quot; documents from the government archive doesn't always release new information into the public domain. Quite often people involved in events referred to in documents have already gone on record in interviews or released their own memoirs/autobiographies, as is the case is this situation. Occasionally the release of documents will provide new information or greater clarity on events, if that is the case you are welcome to edit the article to include this. But it already does cover the negotiations in places, so without a specific complaint it is difficult to proceed. Regards.
