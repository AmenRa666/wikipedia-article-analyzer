== Explanation of Wright's work in ''Certaine Errors'' ==

Hi, [[User:Jheald|Jheald]], thanks for your latest edits to the article. You mentioned that Wright likened the Mercator projection to expanding a balloon or soap bubble inside a cylinder. I seem to recall some of the sources (possibly Hutton) saying that Wright actually referred to a &quot;bladder&quot;. Had balloons been invented in Wright's time? Perhaps you might like to check this and update the article accordingly? — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:38, 7 May 2008 (UTC)

As you rightly say, in the original it was of course &quot;bladder&quot;.  [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|talk]]) 21:46, 7 May 2008 (UTC)

== Translation of Latin phrases ==

Hi, help would be much appreciated with translating the following Latin book titles into English:

*''De Magnete, magneticisque corporibus, et de magno magnete tellure; Physiologia nova, plurimis &amp; argumentis, &amp; experimentis demonstrata'' [On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on that Great Magnet the Earth ...] – what does the rest of the book title say?
::&quot;On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on that Great Magnet the Earth: new natural science demonstrated by many arguemnts and experiments&quot;--[[User:Rafaelgarcia|Rafaelgarcia]] ([[User talk:Rafaelgarcia|talk]]) 01:05, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

*''Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis descriptio; ejusque usus, in utraque trigonometria, ut etiam in omni logistica mathematica, amplissimi, facillimi, &amp; expeditissimi explicatio''
::Description of the wonderful rule of logarithms: a broad, easy and unemcumbered explanation of its use, in trigonometry, as well as in all types of mathematical calculation&quot;--[[User:Rafaelgarcia|Rafaelgarcia]] ([[User talk:Rafaelgarcia|talk]]) 01:05, 21 May 2008 (UTC)
*''Willebrordi Snellii à Royen Tiphys Batavus, sive histiodromice, de navium cursibus et re navali. (Tabulæ canonicæ parallelorum Canones loxodromici προχειροι.)'' Lugduni Batavorum: Ex officinâ Elzeviriana.
::Tiphys Batavus of Willebrord Snellius from Royen, or perhaps histriodromically(?), concerning the courses of ships and naval affairs. (Cannonical tables of parallels. The canons of loxodromicus (?) προχειροι )'' In Leydon Belgium: from the workplace Elzeviriana(?). Can only offer a partial translation here because I don't understand some of the words.--[[User:Rafaelgarcia|Rafaelgarcia]] ([[User talk:Rafaelgarcia|talk]]) 13:01, 21 May 2008 (UTC)
:::''[[Loxodrome]]'' has an article, that seems to be the meaning of ''loxodromicus'' here too. ''Histiodromic'' obviously comes from {{lang|grc|ἱστίον}} 'sail' + {{lang|grc|δρόμος}} 'path', hence 'navigation'. [[Elsevier]] is an historic Dutch publishing house.

Thanks, Rafaelgarcia! — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 02:59, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

== Translation of Greek word ==

In the article &quot;[[Edward Wright (mathematician)]]&quot; a 1624 book by Dutch mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius]] is referred to. The title of the book is ''Willebrordi Snellii à Royen Tiphys Batavus, sive histiodromice, de navium cursibus et re navali. (Tabulæ canonicæ parallelorum Canones loxodromici προχειροι.)''. Is someone able to translate the meaning of the Greek word ''προχειροι'' (''procheiroi'') at the end of the title? Thanks. — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:07, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

: The word πρόχειροι means off-handed, impromptu, improvised, scratchy, unrehearsed, unprepared, rough etc.  My Latin is not what it used to be but does the explanation of the Greek word make any sense in relation to the book's title? Hope I was to some help! [[User:Pel thal|Pel thal]] ([[User talk:Pel thal|talk]]) 18:19, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

Hmmm. With the help of Rafaelgarcia (see the section above), I've rendered the Latin words in the book title as &quot;[''Willebrord Snellius van Royen.''] ''Batavian Tiphys, otherwise Histiodromics (?), Ships' Courses and Naval Matters. (Canonical Tables of Parallels, Loxodromic Canons,'' Procheiroi''.)''&quot;. This book title was from the [http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/6H3AXYYXLBAV2M2DYIP4SH7RNBN4YSG5234SL5J9M65E2VUEPX-35007?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=156701&amp;set_entry=000001&amp;format=999 British Library's online catalogue]. I have to say that &quot;impromptu&quot; or &quot;improvised&quot; at the end of the book title – and in Greek too – doesn't appear to make a huge amount of sense! — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:17, 23 May 2008 (UTC)

:Maybe ''extempore'' or ''extemporaneous''?--[[User:Yannismarou|Yannismarou]] ([[User talk:Yannismarou|talk]]) 13:21, 24 May 2008 (UTC)

It's still puzzling, though. Why the switch from Latin to Greek, and why would any part of the work be improvised or extemporaneous? — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:28, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

:An older meaning of ''procheiros'', matching the original literal meaning &quot;by one's hands&quot;, would be &quot;easily accessible&quot;. That fits better. [[User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|Fut.Perf.]] [[User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼]] 10:33, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

::Yes.  It's probably a nod to [[Ptolomey]], whose book &quot;Procheiroi kanones&quot; (&quot;handy tables&quot;) tabulated all the data needed to compute the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets, the rising and setting of the stars, and eclipses of the Sun and Moon.

::Snellius is offering analogous loxodromic &quot;handy tables&quot;.  [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|talk]]) 11:01, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

:::You're a genius. :-) [[User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|Fut.Perf.]] [[User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼]] 11:24, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

::::No, I just googled ''procheiroi''.  With a good enough search engine, almost anyone can be Stephen Fry. :-) :-)

::''Histiodromice''. Histos = something woven, a web, hence &quot;tissue&quot; in medicine. Dromos = a run, hence a course or a line. So &quot;histiodromics&quot; would be something like the study of weavings together of courses; in present-day language one might say co-ordinate meshes (the meshes not necessarily being made up of straight lines). [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|talk]]) 11:27, 25 May 2008 (UTC)
:::Uhm, about this one I'd disagree, see my post in the section above, I'd say {{lang|grc|ἱστίον}} 'sail', hence 'navigation'. A compound from the 'net' word would be ''histo-'', as in [[histology]], not ''histio-''. [[User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|Fut.Perf.]] [[User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼]] 11:32, 25 May 2008 (UTC)
::::You may be right.  But ''histion'' (a diminutive of ''histos'') can apparently also mean ''web'' or ''cloth'', as well as ''sail''.  [[User:Jheald|Jheald]] ([[User talk:Jheald|talk]]) 12:01, 25 May 2008 (UTC)
::::: Sure. I haven't got access to an Ancient Greek (or Humanistic Greek) dictionary right here, but my Modern Greek one has ιστιοδρομία 'course (of sailing ships)', modern meaning also 'sailing regatta', derived adjective ιστιοδρομικός. All other compounds with ιστιο- seem likewise to be related to sailing. [[User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|Fut.Perf.]] [[User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼]] 12:13, 25 May 2008 (UTC)
:::::: Heh. Now, how's this for a source [http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/schott/schott1/jpg/s384.html]: ''De histiodromica – Histiodromica, ut initio dicebam est illa artis seu scientiæ navigandi pars, quæ navis viam seu cursum docet, hoc est, quæ navim ex uno in alium destinatum locum, magneticæ pyxidis Mappæque nauticæ ope, dirigit itinere maritimo brevissimo &amp; commodissimo.'' [[User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|Fut.Perf.]] [[User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise|☼]] 12:31, 25 May 2008 (UTC)
:::::::This is all fascinating stuff! It's amazing what a few good minds working together can achieve. Thanks to all for working out the mystery. — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:30, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

==&quot;Sciographically&quot;?==
Perhaps you would like to put your collective minds to work on another translation puzzle. Another Latin book mentioned in the article is Adriaan Metius's ''Adriani Metii Alcmar D.M. et matheseos profess. ordin. Primum mobile: astronomicè, sciographicè, geometricè, et hydrographicè, nova methodo explicatum in ... opus absolutum, IV tomis distinctum'', which has been translated [''By Adrianus Metius of Alkmaar, ordained Doctor of Medicine and professor of mathematics.] The Primum Mobile: Astronomically, Sciographically (?), Geometrically and Hydrographically Explained by a New Method in ... a Complete Work Separated into 4 Tomes''. What does &quot;''sciographicè''&quot; mean? &quot;Sciographically&quot; is not a word found in the OED. — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:49, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

Figured it out. &quot;Sciography&quot;, a variant of &quot;sciagraphy&quot;, is the branch of the science of perspective dealing with the projection of shadows, or the art or practice of determining time by observing the shadow of the sun, moon or stars on a dial: {{citation|contribution=sciagraphy|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50215781|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED Online]]|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1989|accessdate=2008-05-26}}. — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:06, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

== Time of birth ==

Hi, [[User:Jheald|Jheald]]. I indicated that Wright was probably born in September or October 1561 based on the fact that he was baptized on [[8 October]] [[1561]], but that assumes he was baptized shortly after birth. I don't know enough about the practice of baptism in 16th-century England to know whether this assumption is justified. Do you think it would be better to remove the speculative month of birth, and just indicate &quot;(baptized [[8 October]] [[1561]]; died November 1615)&quot;? — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:09, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

Have decided to remove the speculative month of birth, as it's possible that Wright was baptized more than a year after his birth. — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:52, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

== Disambig ==

[[Magnetic pole]] and [[merchant seaman]] (two occurrences) need a disambiguation [[User:Randomblue|Randomblue]] ([[User talk:Randomblue|talk]]) 17:11, 14 June 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks. I've fixed this issue. &quot;Magnetic pole&quot; now links to &quot;[[Geomagnetic Pole]]&quot;. This, unfortunately, is also a disambiguation page, but it can't be helped because the reference to &quot;magnetic pole&quot; in the article refers to both the [[North Magnetic Pole]] and [[South Magnetic Pole]]. — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:42, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

== Garveston[e] ==

There is a short stub article on [[Garvestone]] (redirect from Garveston) which I think should be linked in the article. I would usually take WP:BOLD here, but since it is FA am being a little more circumspect. Would other editors agree to this change? (I would make it &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Garvestone|Garveston]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to avoid the redirect.)

My only doubt here is if it is not the same place, but I think that unlikely, and if it is, needs disambiguation anyway. [[User:SimonTrew|SimonTrew]] ([[User talk:SimonTrew|talk]]) 06:33, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

:Are there other Garveston(e)s in Norfolk? If not, go for it. You might also want to do a search and see if you can find anything directly linking Wright to Garvestone. — Cheers, [[User:Jacklee|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ce2029&quot;&gt;Jack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#800000&quot;&gt;'''Lee'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&amp;ndash;[[User talk:Jacklee|talk]]&amp;ndash;&lt;/sup&gt; 07:52, 24 August 2009 (UTC)</text>
