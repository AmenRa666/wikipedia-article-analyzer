If anyone has a photo of Rudder's statue, that would be a good addition to this page rather than Rudder Fountain - it was already uploaded, so I figured I might as well use it. -[[User:Texink|Texink]] 04:47, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

== Expansion ==
If anyone feels it necessary to expand this article a little more, here is a reliable source to use: [http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct8.html]
--[[User:Blueag9|Blueag9]] 17:08, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

== Vision 2020 ==
Does anyone think we should include some info on Vision 2020 or on Gates's tenure? I'm torn. [[User:Karanacs|Karanacs]] 19:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

:Gates' tenure, yes (it is history now). Vision 2020: it's inception into the A&amp;M planning, yes. It's progress, no; (not history yet). &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: maroon; color: white&quot;&gt;[[User:BQZip01|&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;'''— ''BQZip01'' —'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:BQZip01|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:04, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

== Should we include these things? ==
Here are other things I've thought ''might'' have a place in this article, but I'm not sure.
*Formation of Aggie Band
*Formation of [[Yell Leader]]s
*Development of [[12th Man]] tradition
*Introduction of a mascot (first [[Reveille]])
*Milestones in athletic programs - e.g. 1939 football National Championship, 1982,1983, and 1987 softball national championships, 1957 Heisman winner [[John David Crow]], [[Randy Matson]] as an Olympic Gold Medalist during his school years
*2001 Red-White-and-Blue Out
*Aggies suing the Seattle Seahawks over 12th Man
*Cloning

Does anyone else have an opinion? [[User:Karanacs|Karanacs]] 13:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:This is just my opinion, but I think it should be solely an academic history. Thus, only cloning would fit under that criteria. I think [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies]] would be a better place to include historical athletic events, since that's where someone will first look if they want to know some aspect of A&amp;M sports. Great job on the expansion of this article, by the way. -[[User:Texink|Texink]] 20:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::Each of those things has its own article, so the history aspect of each would be suitable in its own respective article. --&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;[[User:Blueag9|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''Blue&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;font color=&quot;#A9A9A9&quot;&gt;g&lt;/font&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt;]] ([[User talk:Blueag9|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Blueag9|contribs]])&lt;/span&gt; 22:05, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::: I agree with Karanacs.  A non Aggie will not know about these events and will not look individual articles.   before  looking up at this page. i feel like a history textbook writer here.  what is notable, and what isn't.  we are living in history[[User:Oldag07|Oldag07]] 14:08, 2 July 2007 (UTC)

::: We need to add from the main article:
:::: With strong support from [[Rice University]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[Association of American Universities]] inducted Texas A&amp;M in May 2001, based on the depth of the university's research and academic programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggie_Daily&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=Texas A&amp;M Selected For Membership In Association Of American Universities|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|date=[[May 7]], [[2001]]|url=http://newsarchives.tamu.edu/stories/01/050701-7.html|accessdate=2007-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::: In 2004, the honors organization [[Phi Beta Kappa]] opened its 265th chapter at Texas A&amp;M.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggie_Daily2&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=Texas A&amp;M Joins Phi Beta Kappa Ranks|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|date=[[February 17]], [[2004]]|url=http://newsarchives.tamu.edu/stories/04/021704-10.html|accessdate=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[User:Oldag07|Oldag07]] 14:03, 2 July 2007 (UTC)  Separate section, into the current status section? [[User:Oldag07|Oldag07]] 14:03, 2 July 2007 (UTC)
:::::That's fine with me if you want to add these. [[User:Karanacs|Karanacs]] 14:04, 2 July 2007 (UTC)
::::Oldag, I doubt someone looking for a history on the band, yell leaders, 12th man, etc will find themselves on this article. Mentions of topics like that may be suitable, but anything longer than a couple sentences should saved for the topic's individual article. In my opinion, the main focus of this article should be academics and research - ''true'' university functions and a subject that does not have its own individual article. -[[User:Texink|Texink]]&lt;sup&gt;'''['''[[User_talk:Texink|talk]]''']'''&lt;/sup&gt; 06:01, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

== This sentence still way too long ==
   
''The Morrill Act, signed into law [[July 2]], [[1862]], granted states public lands to be sold at public auctions to establish a permanent fund to support colleges where the &quot;leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts...in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life&quot;.''

How about:
''The Morrill Act, signed into law [[July 2]], [[1862]], was created to establish colleges where the &quot;leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts...in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life&quot;.  States were granted states public lands that were sold at public auctions that established permanent funds for these colleges'' ???
:Your version is a lot nicer.  I already made the change in the text :) [[User:Karanacs|Karanacs]] 21:04, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

:: Thanks [[User:Oldag07|Oldag07]] 22:46, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

== Picture at the end ==  
What do you think about having one more picture at the end for current status.  something already in our commons should be more than adequate.
ideas:  
* the administration building:
* http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:AdminBuilding_TAMU.jpg

* fish pond
* http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:TAMU_Fishpond2.jpg
:Be bold &amp; just pick one!!! I say go with the Admin building. &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: maroon; color: white&quot;&gt;[[User:BQZip01|&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;'''— ''BQZip01'' —'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:BQZip01|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:26, 9 August 2007 (UTC)
::Yep, one should be there. I agree with BQ; just pick one. →[[User:Wordbuilder|Wordbuilder]] 13:49, 9 August 2007 (UTC)

:I added an image to the Vision 2020 section.  The Chemical Engineering building was added because of Vision 2020, so it fit.  I don't think any of the other images we have really fit within current status.  Of course, if you disagree, feel free to add one and we'll see how it looks.[[User:Karanacs|Karanacs]] 14:54, 9 August 2007 (UTC)
