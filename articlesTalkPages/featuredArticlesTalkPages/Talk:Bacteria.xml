== Number of Species suggestion ==

This was originally written for the [[Species]] page, but was only added in a very abreviated form.  I would like to propose inserting it into this article, following the &quot;Classification and identification&quot; section.  


== Number of Species ==

Total number of bacterial [[species]] (estimated): 5–10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sogin ML, Morrison HG, Huber JA, ''et al.'' |title=Microbial diversity in the deep sea and the underexplored &quot;rare biosphere&quot; |journal=Proc.

* 165,676 [[bacteria]] species with some genetic sequence known (of which 10,045 were in [[Microbiological_culture]])), as of 2011&lt;ref name=NCBItaxonomy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/index.cgi?chapter=statistics |title=NCBI taxonomy tool |publisher=NCBI, NIH |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rationale ===

Here is my reasoning for the above values: 

This paper: The All-Species Living Tree project.  Yarza et al. 20008 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18692976 &lt;ref name=&quot;Yarza2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yarza | first1 = P. | last2 = Richter | first2 = M. | last3 = Peplies | first3 = J. R. | last4 = Euzeby | first4 = J. | last5 = Amann | first5 = R. | last6 = Schleifer | first6 = K. H. | last7 = Ludwig | first7 = W. | last8 = Glöckner | first8 = F. O. | last9 = Rosselló-Móra | first9 = R. | doi = 10.1016/j.syapm.2008.07.001 | title = The All-Species Living Tree project: A 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree of all sequenced type strains | journal = Systematic and Applied Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 241–250 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18692976| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  provides a lower-bound estimate of 6728, since the Type Species they are describing are a subset of named species, almost all of which have been grown in pure culture and are in collections (see article).

While the estimates of 5–10 million bacteria are still current, and probably better supported (as pointed out elsewhere, the species concept is even more difficult for these organisms) the paper listed below &lt;ref name=&quot;Schloss2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15590780| pmc = 539005| year = 2004| author1 = Schloss| first1 = P. D.| title = Status of the microbial census| journal = Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR| volume = 68| issue = 4| pages = 686–91| last2 = Handelsman| first2 = J| doi = 10.1128/MMBR.68.4.686-691.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; cites a range from 10^7 to 10^9 (10 to 1,000 million) for the estimated number of species on the planet.    

There is also published estimates of 35,498 total species richness, based on the 16,000 species that have been &quot;seen by science&quot;.  This latter value is based on the number of different  [[16S_ribosomal_RNA]] or [[RRNA]] genes (also see [[Molecular_phylogenetics]]) that are 98% or more divergent as described in this paper:
Status of the Microbial Census.  Schloss and Handelsman. 2004 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15590780 &lt;ref name=&quot;Schloss2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15590780| pmc = 539005| year = 2004| author1 = Schloss| first1 = P. D.| title = Status of the microbial census| journal = Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR| volume = 68| issue = 4| pages = 686–91| last2 = Handelsman| first2 = J| doi = 10.1128/MMBR.68.4.686-691.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, the data they were basing their estimate on was much less than is in current databases, so I referenced release 10 to the RDP for a current number.  

I've included values from the NCBI GenBank database's Taxonomy section since it is current, and the repository for all sequences.  NCBI also has a taxonomic identifier for each sequence.  &lt;ref name=NCBItaxonomy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/index.cgi?chapter=statistics |title=NCBI taxonomy tool |publisher=NCBI, NIH |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright violation and incorrect information about Gram stain type ==

[[User:Braineeee|Braineeee]] ([[User talk:Braineeee|talk]]) 20:32, 11 October 2014 (UTC)I'm in a Biology course in post secondary school (ie. College) and I needed to find some information about Gram staining. I found a page with the exact same image (from a published book) only a different color. Its the image claimed to have been made by LadyOfHats and uploaded by NI74 in 2006 on this page. Changing 10% of an image (ie. its color) or other copyrighted work does not make it yours to release for free on the internet or in the public domain. That is a violation of copyright law as well. The correct Gram stain for this type of bacteria is Gram negative (using a red/pink Safranin or Fuchsine) dye. The image on this page is blue, and that is completely incorrect, it should be pink. I'm just a tad bit upset that I had to add this comment, and I had to waste my time double checking this for a homework assignment. Other Wikipedia pages about bacteria have conflicting information with this one. My sources are: http://amrita.vlab.co.in/?sub=3&amp;brch=73&amp;sim=208&amp;cnt=1 and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_staining.

:Hi {{ping|Braineeee}} Thanks for your post. Is Number 1 the image you refer to first? If it is then it's almost certain that the book you read copied the image from Wikipedia rather than the other way around. [[User:LadyofHats]] makes amazing illustrations and releases them into the [[public domain]] so that anyone can republish them wherever they like.

:I think you also refer to number 2 which was taken from p4. of [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631903/pdf/11747719.pdf this paper] and I agree that it is a little different to the original. The image is in the public domain however as it was created by employees of the [[Centre for Disease Control]]. Unfortunately it is difficult to find good images for us to use and in this case this might be the best that we can find and we need someone with a good microscope to donate a better one.

== DNA and RNA ==

This is a very useful source on bacteria. My thanks to to all who put it together . 

I am confused about one thing. The text refers to bacteria having RNA in its chromosome whereas the diagram of a bacterium refers to DNA. is there an error in the diagram or am I missing something?

: I think you mean these two sentences: &quot;Most bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus, and their genetic material is typically a single circular chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid. The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA.&quot; This means that the chromosome is made of DNA, but the nucleoid also contains RNA and proteins.

The table in the metabolism section list three energy sources:  phototrophs, lithotroph, and organotroph.  Technically, this is not correct, as lithotroph and organotroph refer to source of reducing equivalents.  Lithotrophs can be photolithotrophs or chemolithotrophs. ~~Glucono  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/50.149.237.104|50.149.237.104]] ([[User talk:50.149.237.104|talk]]) 12:33, 18 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Number of bacteria in human flora ==

The oft-quoted factoid that bacterial cells in the human flora outnumber the human cells ten to one has been revisited and is at least worthy of more scrutiny, and hence, more careful phrasing. &lt;br&gt;

== Antibiotics use in developing countries in Introduction ==

Antibiotics are used throughout the world, not just in the developing world. Could the introduction be changed to represent this? Indeed resistance to certain antimicrobials was actually found in the developing world first. Medications for malaria and Tb spring to mind.
