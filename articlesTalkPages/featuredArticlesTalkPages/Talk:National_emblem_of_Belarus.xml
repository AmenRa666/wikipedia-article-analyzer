== blue flowers at the right ==

These should be [[Cornflower]]s, not [[Flax]]. --[[User:Monkbel|Monk]] 06:38, 3 March 2006 (UTC)
:Ok, though you understand that the word &quot;flax&quot; was used in the EN page of President Lukashenko's website? Well, thanks anyways for the correction. A little heads up too, because of the incident involving Kazulin being arrested and detained, expect a lot of people to come and edit Belarusian related articles. [[User:Zscout370]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Zscout370|(Return Fire)]] [[WP:FU|Fair use policy]] &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 06:48, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

==Deleted parts==
*State emblem may be used anywhere, with the exception of forbidden cases. You are portraying this as if this dictator Luka does what he wants with emblem. 
*Second. de jure/de-facto is POV bullshit. It is emblem of the state. Period. 
*Third. I fixed some nosense phrasing into correct wording, which actually makes it clear that the text deleted by item 1 is anti-luka propaganda, rather than description of facts. Your blanket reverting is inadmissible. [[user:mikkalai|mikka]] [[user talk:mikkalai|(t)]] 21:36, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

== Pahonia ==

Under Pahonia picture &quot;The Pahonia as it appeared in 1991&quot;. &quot;Re-appeared in 1991&quot; will be more exact. [[User:Lisouczyk1|Lisouczyk1]] ([[User talk:Lisouczyk1|talk]]) 15:14, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

== 1995 referendum ==

The part &quot;However Article 74...&quot; makes no sense: I don't see any contradiction that warrants the word &quot;however&quot;: the constitution quote says about '''initiation''' of the referendum, not about the interpretation of its results.[[user:mikkalai|mikka]] [[user talk:mikkalai|(t)]] 00:59, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
:Ah, ok. I used that same reference at [[Flag of Belarus]] and if you want me to take that out there, thats fine. [[User:Zscout370]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Zscout370|(Return Fire)]] [[WP:FU|Fair use policy]] &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 01:01, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
::Mikka's right; the quote doesn't seem particularly relevant here. --[[User:Spangineer|Spangineer]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Spangineer|(h√°blame)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 04:37, 7 March 2006 (UTC)
:::Ok, remove it. [[User:Zscout370]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Zscout370|(Return Fire)]] [[WP:FU|Fair use policy]] &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 04:39, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Pahonia and the former white-red-white flag were compared with Nazi  symbols in the run-up to the vote.&quot; Does not accord reality and is piece of communists/Lukashenko propaganda. Nazi did not agree to legalize white-red-white flag since they did not have plans for creation of separate belarussian State and feared that it will cause them problems in the future. But comparing to russian communists they were clever enough to close eyes when flag was used. BTW, modern russian flag was used by Russian Liberation Army created by Nazi but this did not become the reason to call it &quot;nazi&quot; flag. Together with official links page looks like history of Lukashenko, but not Belarus. Additionally, Lukashenko used referendum for overturn and pro-russian dictatorshop installation. By this action he brutally broke constitution where it was written that referendum has not low power and can be ragarded only as &quot;advisory&quot;. Whole action accompained by controlled mass media propaganda. Even in this case given percent of voted for change is a percent of those who participated in &quot;referendoom&quot; that is less than a half of voters.I want to stress next point once more: Flag of Lukashenko never was and will never become '''national''' for Belarus. Current materials just repeat point of this guy, who once said to the whole country that F.Skaryna lived in St.Petersburg. Hope you guys are able to check the dates yourself. [[User:Lisouczyk1|Lisouczyk1]] ([[User talk:Lisouczyk1|talk]]) 12:34, 28 April 2010 (UTC)
:&quot;&quot;Pahonia and the former white-red-white flag were compared with Nazi  symbols in the run-up to the vote.&quot; Does not accord reality and is piece of communists/Lukashenko propaganda.&quot; that is exactly why this sentence wis here. This was actual propaganda used against the 1991 symbols and there is a citation for it. [[User:Zscout370]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Zscout370|(Return Fire)]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 13:18, 28 April 2010 (UTC)
::Then we have to point out that it is propaganda and symbols were not officially legalized at war time. Sentence brings different meaning in text and exactly this &quot;does not accord reality&quot;. Should we leave such a rubbish? [[User:Lisouczyk1|Lisouczyk1]] ([[User talk:Lisouczyk1|talk]]) 15:10, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

== Bobblewik ==
Bobblewik's edit at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_emblem_of_Belarus&amp;curid=457096&amp;diff=43074377&amp;oldid=43063582] is alright with me, since I asked him to do this on several occasions to Belarusian related articles. [[User:Zscout370]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Zscout370|(Return Fire)]] [[WP:FU|Fair use policy]] &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 03:13, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

== Belorusian language ==
Could someone who knows about this add a section on the language and who actually speaks it? [[User:Pawebster|APW]] ([[User talk:Pawebster|talk]]) 13:09, 27 October 2008 (UTC)

== Move to [[Coat of arms of Belarus]] ==

Belarussians call their coat of arms &quot;state coat of arms&quot;. They don't call it a national emblem, so Wikipedia shouldn't either. [[User talk:Zocky|Zocky]] | [[User:Zocky/Picture Popups|picture popups]] 13:11, 27 October 2008 (UTC) P.S: Yes, I know about &quot;coat of arms is a shield&quot; argument, but neither I, nor a great many countries around the world, care.
:I see that &quot;nor great many countries around the world care&quot; writing here &quot;history&quot; of Belarus. But I do, because I'm from Belarus. In fact, people in Belarus have several invented names for new &quot;symbols&quot;. [[User:Lisouczyk1|Lisouczyk1]] ([[User talk:Lisouczyk1|talk]]) 12:46, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

== FAR withdrawn ==
I have withdrawn [[Wikipedia:Featured article review/National emblem of Belarus/archive1]]; please see the FAR instructions:
{{quotation|Nominators typically assist in the process of improvement; they may post only one nomination at a time, should not nominate articles that are [[Wikipedia:Today's featured article|featured on the main page]] (or have been featured there in the previous three days), and should avoid segmenting review pages. }}

: Bogdan has a point, though ‚Äî this is a pretty bad FA that needs more work even to be a GA, and that should have been noted before it was scheduled for TFA: only our best work should appear on the Main Page. In 2006, it may have been good enough; today, it's far from being FA-quality. The FAR should be restarted as soon as three days have passed, if that's what our guidelines suggest. But that doesn't fix a major overlooking. ''[[User:TodorBozhinov|Todor]][[User_talk:TodorBozhinov|‚Üí]][[User:TodorBozhinov|Bozhinov]]'' 14:45, 27 October 2008 (UTC)
::I am going to fix what Bogdan suggested, was to shore up references and to use more book references. However, I cannot do this alone, so any help that can be provided, it will be great. [[User:Zscout370]] &lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Zscout370|(Return Fire)]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 17:18, 27 October 2008 (UTC)

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:2|one external link|2 external links}} on [[National emblem of Belarus]]. Please take a moment to review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=686464314 my edit]. If necessary, add {{tlx|cbignore}} after the link to keep me from modifying it. Alternatively, you can add {{tlx|nobots|deny{{=}}InternetArchiveBot}} to keep me off the page altogether. I made the following changes:
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20090107060449/http://gpk.gov.by/ru-border_patrol-history-heraldry/ to http://gpk.gov.by/ru-border_patrol-history-heraldry/
*Added archive https://web.archive.org/20081228130854/http://pbnf.org:80/symvol.html to http://pbnf.org/symvol.html

When you have finished reviewing my changes, please set the ''checked'' parameter below to '''true''' to let others know.

{{sourcecheck|checked=false}}

Cheers. ‚Äî[[User:Cyberbot II|&lt;sup style=&quot;color:green;font-family:Courier&quot;&gt;cyberbot II]]&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub style=&quot;margin-left:-14.9ex;color:green;font-family:Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Cyberbot II|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Talk to my owner]]:Online&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 07:36, 19 October 2015 (UTC)</text>
