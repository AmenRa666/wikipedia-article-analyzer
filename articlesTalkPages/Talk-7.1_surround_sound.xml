[[:8 channel audio]] → [[7.1]] — This should be renamed to [[7.1]] (surround sound). That's how it's widely known and named (compared to 8 channel audio) and it would match the naming structure with previous configurations ([[5.1]]). [[User:Sujayt|Sujayt]] ([[User talk:Sujayt|talk]]) 01:54, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

Unsure. It's a fairly esoteric name. Sure, those who know about this topic use this terminology, but many would not even recognise it as the name of a surround sound system. Would [[7.1 surround sound|7.1 surround sound]] be acceptable as an alternative? [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 07:51, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

*&lt;s&gt;'''Support'''&lt;/s&gt;.  My system is 7.1 and they are marketed as such. Google returns 215,000 hits for &quot;8 surround sound&quot;, 2,750,000 for &quot;7.1 surround sound&quot; and 169,000 for &quot;8 surround sound&quot; -7.1. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 08:08, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
**So, would you be happy with ''7.1 surround sound'' rather thn just ''7.1'' as currently proposed? [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 09:41, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
***Yes to 7.1 surround sound.  While 7.1 is correct and likely the common name, making the name clear is not an issue here.  [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 19:17, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
****See also [[Talk:5.1#Requested move]] for a proposal to move to ''5.1 surround sound''. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 18:07, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
*****I think [[7.1 surround sound]] and [[5.1 surround sound]] would be great compromises for both articles (with [[5.1]] and [[7.1]] redirected to the articles), and would unite with the most commonplace and understandable naming method. --Sujayt 19:54, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
******Agree on the redirects. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 08:03, 3 June 2010 (UTC)
****It's perhaps not a clear as it might be, but I think this is also a ''support'' vote for the alternative proposal to move to ''7.1 surround sound'', which is formally proposed below. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 05:13, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

Agree that the current name isn't right. It's not just that there are more common names, also a problem is that ''8 channel audio'' is ambiguous. For example, many early 1/2&quot; [[multitrack]] [[reel to reel]] tape recorders and a least one 1/4&quot; model were ''eight channel audio'', but they weren't 7.1, in fact they weren't [[surround sound]] at all. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 17:28, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

See also [[Multitrack recording#History]]. Eight track is a type of eight channel audio, and turns out to be more historically important than I realised. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 17:36, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' move to [[7.1]].  Support the alternative proposal below. [[User:Snottywong|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Copperplate;font-size:15px;border:#AAAACC 1px solid&quot;&gt;{{#if:Snotty|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#DDDDFF;color:#008822;&quot;&gt;Snotty&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#008822;&quot;&gt;#DDDDFF&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:Wong|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#DDDDFF;color:#006611;&quot;&gt;Wong&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006611;&quot;&gt;#DDDDFF&lt;/span&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Snottywong|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:26, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

===Alternative proposal===

[[:8 channel audio|8 channel audio]] → [[7.1 surround sound|7.1 surround sound]] as discussed above.

* '''Support''' alternative proposal as nominator, see arguments above. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 08:03, 3 June 2010 (UTC)
* '''Support''' --Sujayt 22:06, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
* '''Support (was Oppose)''' There are three different -- very different -- kinds of eight channel audio: the old eight-track cassette (sometimes called car or Lear cassettes), even older eight track audio tape, in 1/4&quot;, 1/2&quot;, and 1&quot; formats (and in analog and digital forms, and some not even tape), and the new 7.1 surround system (which in some ways is not eight channels at all!) Covering all of these in one article is probably not useful; I'm inclined to ''eight channel audio'' being a disambiguation term, pointing at the three different topics, rather than assuming that 7.1 is meant. [[User:OtterSmith|htom]] ([[User talk:OtterSmith|talk]]) 15:33, 4 June 2010 (UTC)
:Changing to support; this article has nothing to do with eight channel audio, that article needs to be written. [[User:OtterSmith|htom]] ([[User talk:OtterSmith|talk]]) 16:39, 4 June 2010 (UTC)
::Agree. Not sure a disambiguation page is the best approach, it's arguably not strictly disambiguation as Wikipedia uses the term although an appeal to [[WP:IAR]] might be a success here! I'm also tending towards an overview article on all eight channel systems, which have been particularly significant in several different areas. Such an overview would link to this more detailed article on 7.1, to relevant multitrack articles including [[multitrack recording]] and [[history of multitrack recording]] and possibly use the image at [[:File:Korg D888.jpg]], to the detailed article on [[8-track tape]], and possibly to others. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] ([[User talk:Andrewa|talk]]) 21:49, 4 June 2010 (UTC)
*'''Support''' move to [[7.1 surround sound]] per nominator.  This move would standardize these article names, as the discussion at [[Talk:5.1#Requested move]] appears to be headed down the same track. [[User:Snottywong|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Copperplate;font-size:15px;border:#AAAACC 1px solid&quot;&gt;{{#if:Snotty|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#DDDDFF;color:#008822;&quot;&gt;Snotty&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#008822;&quot;&gt;#DDDDFF&lt;/span&gt;}}{{#if:Wong|&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#DDDDFF;color:#006611;&quot;&gt;Wong&lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006611;&quot;&gt;#DDDDFF&lt;/span&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Snottywong|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:26, 7 June 2010 (UTC)
*'''Support''' per the entire discussion and [[:5.1 surround sound]]. [[User:Vegaswikian|Vegaswikian]] ([[User talk:Vegaswikian|talk]]) 21:16, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
:''The above discussion is preserved as an archive of a [[WP:RM|requested move]].  &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Please do not modify it.'''&lt;/span&gt; Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on this talk page.

== 7.1 audio in gaming ==

i think id would be worth to add a section what 7.1 audio means to gaming.
when using a 7.1 audio system or headset you will have great directional sound that is usefull in fps games, if someone tries to sneak up behind you, wou will hear them!  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/77.249.159.41|77.249.159.41]] ([[User talk:77.249.159.41|talk]]) 18:40, 26 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

This article is all about geometry, so it is screaming for diagrams to help readers (like me) to visualize what's now only written in words.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jeffryfisher|Jeffryfisher]] ([[User talk:Jeffryfisher|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jeffryfisher|contribs]]) 21:34, 23 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

I agree with this, I came here looking for a picture of the 7.1 setup. The description is really unclear, and assumes I already know how 5.1 works. I just googled for a different website instead.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.241.62.17|108.241.62.17]] ([[User talk:108.241.62.17|talk]]) 22:34, 12 December 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Need section describing &quot;6.1&quot; systems ==

There are a number of receivers that refer to themselves as &quot;6.1&quot; systems. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTS_(sound_system)#DTS_Neo:X|See this also]] There needs to be information describing what the difference between this and 7.1 systems.

Really, this article needs a complete rewrite esp. as to the audio/decoding that the individual channels are arrived at. [[User:Nodekeeper|Nodekeeper]] ([[User talk:Nodekeeper|talk]]) 18:38, 14 January 2014 (UTC)</text>
