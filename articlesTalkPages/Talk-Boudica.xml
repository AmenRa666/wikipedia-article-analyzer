==Issues==
Nice job! tanx buddy Two things - the location of the Iceni territory (more or less), would be handy;  and what happened to the daughters?  I only vaguely remember that their rape and or otherwise outraging was a contributing factor.  --MichaelTinkler

in the bit about (paraphrasing) &quot;retreating soldiers prevented from fleeing by their families&quot;, it's written a little bit ambiguously: presumably it means that the families were physically crowding the way. Alternately, it could mean that their families refused to allow them to leave, urging them to stay and fight. Since I don't know the right answer, I won't clean it up.

I've rewritten that bit - it should be a bit clearer now. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 16:56, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Everyone is a bit ambiguous about the exact dates involved. Is it really not known for sure exactly when Boudicca was defeated? Would the fact that it's descibed as 60/61 suggest that it was around the turn of the year? - Jayem

No, it's pretty clear from Tacitus that the revolt started in the spring or summer (campaigning season) and was defeated before the start of winter. Dates from Britain in this period have been worked out by counting up the years served by each governor. There's a one year margin for error because it's not clear whether Quintus Veranius died within twelve months of being appointed, or within the calendar year of his appointment. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 18:08, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I have cross referenced the bit of trivial about Boudicca and platform 9-3/4 Kings Cross station from the Harry Potter page.  --Andrew Grimmke

Yes it is true that it was started in spring but on the Roman calendar the year starts in March so it would be the March of 62 C.E but then considered the turn of the year. -Royal Russell 9:54 PM, 8/31/2005

:It's true that the Roman calendar started in March, but the dates in question aren't based on the original Roman calendar. The relavant historians (Tacitus and Dio Cassius) used the consuls to identify the year, and the consuls took office on 1 January, so events they describe are dated retrospectively using a January-December year. However, Tacitus isn't entirely annalistic when dealing with Britain in his Annals, but often sums up a period of several years at an appropriate place in the overall narrative, and Dio Cassius's account comes from an epitome which doesn't mention the consuls, hence having to count up years served by governors. The rebellion (or at least the build-up) started before seed-time, as Tacitus says the Britons had neglected to sow their crops, hoping to seize Roman grain, so it could have started before March and therefore in the calendar year of 59 or 60 and ended at the start of winter 60 or 61. By the turn of 62 it would have been all over, and Suetonius Paulinus would have been carrying out his punitive operations. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 19:18, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

Now on to a different subject: MichaelTinkler you said you had a bit of trouble with under standing where Iceni is. Well Iceni is the bump sticking out just above Kent, which is modern-day Norwich. And her daughters, Cammora and Tasca probaly poisoned themselves with Boudicca.
-Royal Russell, 9:31 PM, 9/28/2005

That &quot;bump sticking out&quot; is in fact East Anglia, comprising the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.  Norwich is the main city in Norfolk.....

OMG! I just re-read what I wrote back more than a year ago! I feel really dumb! &quot;bump sticking out?&quot; How could I be so air-headed? Anyway I go by a different name now rather than ''Royal Russell''. [[User:Jim Bart]] 04:30, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

==Death?==
Okay, I thought the part on her death was a) a bit short and didn't do justice to the in depth article, b) There is a little more to it than simply either swhe died or got ill. So I'd thought I'd expand it, just not to a geeat extent.

&quot;According to Tacitus in his Annals, Boudica poisoned herself, though in the Agricola which was written almost twenty years prior he mentions nothing of suicide and atributes the end of the revolt to socordiam indolence; Dio says she fell sick and died then given a lavish burial; though this may be a convenient way to remove her from the story. Considering Dio must have read Tacitus, it is worth noting he mentions nothing about suicide (which was also how Postumus and Nero also ended their lives)&quot;

That is what I wrote, I would like it if someone would tidy it a bit and add a source ref. I do have a ref only I have no idea as how to do it...far to confusing for me.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Defying-Rome-Guy-Bedoyere/dp/0752444409 the book is in depth and is written by a man respected in the field. The Chapter Boudica (pages 69-70) mentions the part I added.

:Thank you for your time, [[User:Wordreader|Wordreader]] ([[User talk:Wordreader|talk]]) 05:46, 6 March 2014 (UTC)

::It is not quite that simple.
::There are only three sources in antiquity that mention Boudica. Dio, Tacitus and Agricula.
::Dio mentions absolutely nothing about her being poisoned. The only times he mentions poison is when referring to Nero's disposal methods and death. Dio states Boudica &quot;fell sick and died.&quot; There is no evidence whatsoever in Dio's works that suggest she had poisoning of any kind.
::It is pure speculation on that Woods part. He seems to have made a connection with &quot;getting ill&quot; and &quot;poison&quot;. After all, if you have poison, you get ill right? But this is Woods' opinion and it is shared with neither Dio nor the Agricula.
::The Agricula put it down to indolence. He was a Tribune at the very time Boudica had her rebellion. Agricula was contemporaneity to her time of death, there is a good chance he was at the battle. Yet he mentioned nothing of poison.
::Tacitus writes of poison. He is the only one.
::Two of of three historical sources say she wasn't poisoned - and one of those sources was present at the time. If this was a courtroom, poison would most likely be ruled out as the cause of death. The only real thing that keeps it popular is tradition.
::[[DarkMithras]] 2015

:::That's something of a misunderstanding of the facts. There are indeed three sources (all of which are linked from the article so you can read them), but two are by the same author. [[Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' in about AD 98, in which he gives a fairly cursory overview of the revolt, which doesn't mention how Boudica died. He gives a more detailed account in the ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', written c.116, in which he says she committed suicide by poison.  [[Cassius Dio]] wrote his ''Roman History'' after AD 229, but the passage about Boudica's revolt survives only in an [[epitome]] or abridgement made by [[John Xiphilinus]] in the 11th century, which says that she fell ill and died.

:::Tacitus is the earlier source. He wrote within living memory of the events, and is likely to have had a first-hand source as his father-in-law, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], was a junior officer on the staff of the governor of Britain at the time of the revolt. His two accounts do not contradict each other on this point, because only one of them mentions how Boudica died. Cassius Dio is a later source, writing outside living memory of the events, and we only know what he wrote second hand. Most historians would conclude that Tacitus is more likely to be reliable on this subject. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] ([[User talk:Nicknack009|talk]]) 17:28, 28 January 2015 (UTC)

:::DarkMithras
:::That's what happens when I a) do not reread what I write and make edits b) check facts and make sure I have not crossed wires. :(
:::Okay, here is what I mean - and I have the book in front of me so I cannot makes mistakes. Take in mind that Guy de la Bedoyere is no maverick, nor is he a fringe historian. He is as accepted and as mainstreak as you can get... and he says this. 

::::&quot;This brings us now to the curious mystery of the end of Boudica. Her fate is not really very clear. Tacitus says she 'ended her life with poison'. Dio says that in the aftermath [of the battle] she grew sick and died.&quot;
::::&quot;... having served her literary purpose she was written out as quickly as possible. It is interesting that the two accounts of her death are so radically different. Tacitus ought to have been more accurate, but suicide was also how Nero ended his life eight years later and it was the was disgraced camp prefect of II Augusta escaped punishment. Given her personality, as described by the Roman historians, it is scarcely credible that shew would end her life so ignominious a fashion. So it is quite possible that when he came to write the Annals, suicide suited his dramatic purpose.&quot;
::::In the Agricola which he wrote nearly twenty years before the Annals, Tacitus attributed the revolts demise to socordiam, 'indolence', and made no mention of Boudica's end. On the other hand, Dio's account of her withering away and dying from an illness sounds more like a convenient way of removing her. Surely if she had committed suicide Dio would have known about it.&quot;
::::&quot;We really need to ask whether Boudica's real role in the whole revolt was ever really very significant at all, and just possibly whether she actually existed.&quot;

:::As I said, this is Bedoyere. It is what he writes. Wikipedia isn't biased, it tells all facts from all sides given they have a credible source. It doesn't matter if &quot;Most historians would conclude&quot;. They do not all agree, so is contested therefore be included.

::::Both versions are included. The article states clearly that the sources differ, and doesn't come down in favour of one version or the other. I explained why I thought Tacitus' account in the Annals is more likely to be reliable than Dio's, not because I wanted to rule out Dio's account, but because you were arguing in favour of ruling out Tacitus's account. De la Bedoyere is just as sceptical of Dio as he is of Tacitus, so he does not support your argument that we should follow Dio rather than Tacitus. De la Bedoyere is a well-known historian of Roman Britain, but the extract is not offering any &quot;facts&quot;, but rather his opinion on the known facts, and I would suggest this is a minority opinion at best and does not represent scholarly consensus. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] ([[User talk:Nicknack009|talk]]) 23:49, 15 March 2015 (UTC)

== Roman forces outnumbered, or Boudica's forces? ==
In the second paragraph, this caught my attention:
&quot;Roman emperor Nero briefly considered withdrawing Roman forces from the island, but ultimately Boudica was defeated at the Battle of Watling Street '''by the heavily outnumbered forces''' of Roman provincial governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus.&quot; ('''bold''' added for emphasis)

Is this correct? Were the Roman forces outnumbered, or were Boudica's forces outnumbered? I didn't edit it, since I don't know the facts, but it makes more sense if Boudica's forces were outnumbered, not the Roman forces. Can someone look into this and make the necessary changes?[[User:70.17.38.39|70.17.38.39]] 17:00, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

According to the History Channel special airing 3/26/06 - Boudica's forces outnumbered the Roman forces. However, her forces were more 'savage' and not highly trained nor protected like the Roman forces, hence the loss.

Boudiccas forces outnumbered the Romans by about 20 to 1.--[[User:Andy mci|Andy mci]] 17:49, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

==Brythonic Celtic?==
In the first paragraph the text explicitly states that she was the ruler of the &quot;Brythonic Celtic Iceni&quot;. I think this need to be less emphatic as there is a growing level of support for the idea that the pre-roman people of Eastern Britain were not in any way Celtic. Now there are theories that they might have been &quot;Germanic&quot; but there is strong genetic evidence of cultural and ethnic difference between the east a west in Britain.

I just believe that this debate about the origin of the people of eastern Britain should be reflected and that theory and evidence has moved on.

:As far as I know there is no evidence whatsoever of Germanic language in pre-Roman or early Roman Britain, and plenty for Celtic. Odd that the anti-Celticists will emphasise archaeological continuity when it suits them, and archaeological difference when it suits them, to deny Celtic influence in Britain. The evidence - some genetic but no linguistic evidence for Germanic presence in south-eastern Britain - suggests that Caesar was right all along, and the Belgae - Celtic-speakers with some Germanic roots - settled there in the 2nd/1st century BC! --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 21:55, 17 July 2007 (UTC)

==&quot;Early life&quot; section==
This section is largely rubbish. The bit about her family being well-off is okay, and the roundhouse is reasonable supposition, but there's no evidence that the (medieval Irish) practice of fostership was practiced in Britain (and the purpose of it in Ireland was more about political patronage than &quot;learning how to be sociable&quot;). The bit about &quot;warrior school&quot; and the date of her marriage are simply invented. This is not history and does not belong in an encyclopedia. Cite sources or it should be removed. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 19:22, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

==Age?==
Ok now how old would Prasutagus be at his death? What was the normal age for a Icenian Briton at the time? Or any Briton?

:Prasutagus's age at death is not given in any of the sources, therefore nobody knows. It's not even known that, as is often assumed, he died in 60. The account of the conspiracy to rebel given in ''Agricola'' suggests that discontent had been building for some time, so he could easily have died, and the Iceni lands been annexed, quite a number of years previously. Stats for average life expectancy in Britain at the time don't exist, so any attempt to give a figure would only be guesswork. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 23:07, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
::A lot of history is only guesses.  [[User:Poserlkg|Poserlkg]]
::The whole thing sounds implausibly sudden as usually told. *Why* was Boudica flogged and her daughters raped? It makes more sense if we assume a history of friction, perhaps even of active assistance to rebels in other parts of Britain: but that can never be more than speculation.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/87.112.164.240|87.112.164.240]] ([[User talk:87.112.164.240|talk]]) 13:47, 27 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Boudica's name ==
I am just a casual reader, but I noticed an error near the top of this article - was Prasutagus her husband or her father? I guess it is possible they both had the name, but not likely. An edit is needed here.

:The article doesn't say Prasutagus was her father, but I can see it how might be taken to mean that. I've clarified it. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] ([[User talk:Nicknack009|talk]]) 07:56, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

The article states that: &quot;Kenneth Jackson concludes that the correct spelling of the name is Boudica, pronounced /bəʊ'diː.ka:/, although it is mispronounced by many as /buː.dik'ə/&quot;

However, the stress markings are in the wrong place for IPA transcriptions: I assume the contributor meant /'bəʊdiː.kaː/ (with stress on the 1st syllable) and /buː'dɪkə/ (with stress on the 2nd syllable) respectively. However, I've never heard the name being pronounced with stress on the 2nd syllable - it is usually pronounced &quot;BOO-di-ka&quot; (ie. /'buːdɪkə/).

Can anyone confirm the pronunciation before I edit the article? I particularly would like confirmation of Kenneth Jackson's pronunciation of the name (note that the system of transcription used in the book may place stress markings after the stressed syllable, rather than before it). Thanks, --[[User:Malfidus|Dave]] ~ [[User_talk:Malfidus|(talk)]] 12:19, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

:To quote the article in question:

:&quot;The philological fact is that the name must have been ''Boudica'', pronounced in phonetic terminology /boudi:ka:/, in 'English' spelling it would be ' ''Bowdeekah'' ', where ''ow'' means the dipthong seen in e.g. the phrases 'tie a bow' or 'bow and arrow', and the stressed syllable is the ''dee'', with long vowel, the final ''a'' being also long. The generally accepted ''Boudicca'' is probably (and incorrectly) pronounced by most people as /budikə/, or, in popular spelling, ' ''Boodikka'' '.&quot;

:Don't know how that would be best rendered in IPA, but hopefully it should help you. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 17:08, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

:: Thanks. I corrected the article. --[[User:Malfidus|Dave]] ~ [[User_talk:Malfidus|(talk)]] 20:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)


Could some one explain to me how it should be pronounced instead of BOO-di-kah? is it Bee-oo-dik-ah?  or what? sorry I'm an air-head (see above my comments made signed as &quot;Royal Russell&quot;). [[User:Texas Drama King|- signing off as the Drama King from Texas!]] 06:17, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

:The ''o'' and the ''u'' are pronounced separately, so it comes out as something like &quot;bow&quot; as in &quot;bow-and-arrow&quot;. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 12:47, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

: I was wrong. It is in fact ''Boudica''. This spelling was used for ages before a Roman historian spelt it as ''Boudicca''. Someone in the middle ages found it and mistook the ''o'' for an ''a'' and the second ''c'' for an ''e'', hence the spelling ''Boadicea''.

The article shows a picture of a statue of Emperor Claudius. I would say this belongs to another article, and this article about Boudica should show a picture of Boudica, if such is available. [[User:84.112.148.111|84.112.148.111]] 07:04, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

==Iceni or Eceni?==
I've reverted back to the spelling &quot;Iceni&quot; for now. It may be that &quot;Eceni&quot; is more accurate (but then again, Iron Age British coin spellings are pretty variable, particularly between ''E'' and ''I''), but Wikipedia policy is that the best known version of a name should be used, and as far as I know the scholarly literature still uses &quot;Iceni&quot;. My suggestion would be to find an authoritative scholarly work that supports the spelling &quot;Eceni&quot; as the more accurate one and edit the [[Iceni]] article accordingly (the way this one does with Kenneth Jackson and the spelling &quot;Boudica&quot;), and after that, roll out the change to this article and others. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 12:37, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

The circumstances of her death are mostly speculative, I doubt there is much credence to the Train Station theory.

The location of the Metchley &quot;Camp&quot; (in fact, a series of Roman forts) is not &quot;near&quot; King's Norton in Birmingham. It is over two miles away, implying a rather large battlefield if the relevant theory is to be believed.[[User:EEye|EEye]] ([[User talk:EEye|talk]]) 01:02, 15 January 2008 (UTC)

== Recent edit reverted ==
[[User:Fabartus|Fabartus]], I have reverted your edit to the opening of the article. Firstly, starting with &quot;best known as Boadicea&quot; is incorrect, as the correct name is now very well known and used in all sources from popular to scholarly. It is also bad practice to open with the incorrect name. Secondly, the year of her death is not certain (it was either 60 or 61, but Tacitus is not precise enough to allow us to plump for one or the other, as is discussed elsewhere on the talk page. Thirdly, the opening clarification bit is entirely unnecessary as the matter is discussed thoroughly in the article. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 15:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

She IS best-known as Boadicea. I only recently discovered &quot;Boudica&quot;. Perhaps historians and scholars know the correct pronunciation, but wikipedia (like any encyclopedia) is not written for scholars who already know everything, but for the average person (who says &quot;Boadicea&quot;).

:Further corrections: Catus Decianus was not a proconsul. Tacitus says that Boudicca was flogged and her daughters raped, not that all three of them were flogged and raped. The &quot;ambush&quot; of the 9th legion is fiction - Tacitus gives no details of how it was defeated, just that it was defeated. Londinium was not yet the capital of Roman Britain. Tacitus makes no mention of the evacuation of Verulamium by Suetonius.

EVERYONE outside of Britain and US uses the Latin --Boadicea-- as the correct spelling. &quot;Who says Boadicea?&quot; -- 
Everyone, they even pronounce it as Latin BO-A-DI-CEA. Whereas &quot;C&quot; is a non-existent sound in English, and EA is construed as a diphthong.
You cannot claim &quot;Boudica&quot; is the correct spelling -- since there are no written BRITON sources of the time.

The documentary &quot;The Roman war machine&quot; states that after an early defeat to the Celts the Romans had to bribe the Celts to leave Rome. The Romans then completely changed their military tactics with smaller, more mobile but smaller groups of soldiers replacing phalanxes in case anyone was wondering.

== Name on Statue ==
Does anyone know, is there a name on the statue that illustrates this article?  I'm guessing that if there is, the name is more likely to be Boadicea than it is Boudica (unless the statue was produced in the late twentieth century, and in style it looks more likely to be late nineteenth).  Works of art tend to retain the names given to them by the artist.  If later scholarship finds new orthographies, the spelling of the original is nonetheless usually maintained.  So if someone knows this statue (or lives nearby and can go take a squint at it)...  If the statue is entitled Boadicea, I would suggest that the caption read &quot;statue of Boadicea (Boudica)&quot;. [[User:Mddietz|Mddietz]] 20:32, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

== Spellingand pronunciation ==
[[User:Kwamikagami]], I've tried to be as clear as I can. Jackson is not arguing what the name &quot;would have become&quot; (whatever that means), but what it actually ''was''. He argues that the vowels of the first syllable are a dypthong consisting of an ''o'' sound followed by a ''u'' sound, which is similar to the &quot;ow&quot; in &quot;bow-and-arrow&quot; in English - but it's not ''əʊ'', as it would be pronounced in BBC English/RP - the ''o'' is an ''o'', not a schwa. It's definitely not ''aʊ'', which is the vowel of &quot;house&quot;. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] ([[User talk:Nicknack009|talk]]) 22:42, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

- was moved by me for discussion. Normally, I simply delete game references as non-notable and to keep wikipedia from becoming a marketing tool via google search results. However, because of the cultural section's notable size, I think the paragraph, after expansion on why it is notable in how Boudica was depicted in the games, should be included. --[[User:OrbitOne|OrbitOne]] ([[User talk:OrbitOne|talk]]) 01:37, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

I'm not certain, but the caption under the picture [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boudiccagatehouse.jpg] in the article seems to represent the young lady in the picture as the subject of the article. It may be due to a long day, but I'm having trouble coming up with something that would work well in its place, perhaps something along the lines of &quot;A reenactor portrays Boudica outside a gatehouse&quot; would work, but I'd like a few opinions before changing it.

==References??? ==
What's with the first paragraphs? Has no one here ever heard of references and citations? Where was all this stuff copied from? Or was it made up? I came to here looking for some specific information about Boadicea, only to be told -- authoritatively and in a tone of immense self-assurance -- that that was &quot;formerly&quot; her name. Oh yeah? What happened -- she get married or something? What does &quot;formerly&quot; mean and who sez? In brief, without references, it's all original research. Don't believe me? Here's an example.

: &quot;Boudica has since remained an important cultural symbol in the United Kingdom. The absence of native British literature during the early part of the first millennium means that Britain owes its knowledge of Boudica's rebellion to the writings of the Romans.&quot; (From the last paragraph of the Introduction.) Without references, this pure OR.

: Here's another example. &quot;... Boadicea ... known in Welsh as &quot;Buddug&quot; ... (d. AD 60 or 61) was a queen of the Brittonic Iceni tribe of what is now known as East Anglia in England, who led an uprising of the tribes against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire.&quot; The word &quot;who&quot; following &quot;England&quot; -- to whom does it refer? In usual sloppy English, probably Boadicea, but in correct grammar, it refers to the Iceni.

No, I am NOT going to fix up this article. I came here for information, not to edit stuff. I do not want to waste time editing out the weasel words in the section on her name (e.g.,&quot;probably derived,&quot; &quot;almost certainly&quot;) or trying to figure out what the two inadequately cited authors may have meant.
The article is a mess.

::This is all rather confused; firstly the article incorrectly states that &quot;Until the late 20th century, Boudica was known as Boadicea.&quot; This is simply untrue. In fact she was known by several variants of her name, which moved in and out of &quot;fashion&quot; over time. She is called Bonduca in Holinshed's Chronicles (1577), and so also gets called [[Bonduca]] in the famous Jacobean play about her. That probably remained the most common form of the name into the 18th century, as in Purcell's ''Bonduca suite''. Boadicea is prefered by Victorian writers because they thought it sounded more dignified, but even then scholars were aware of other variants. Boudica - which is really a ''return'' to a version similar to the once-popular Bonduca - becomes more common in the late 20th century.

== Edit Request - BBC Radio 4's In Our Time ==
BBC Radio 4's In Our Time is a 45 minute discussion programme about the history of ideas, with three eminent academics in their field, hosted by Melvyn Bragg. Each edition deals with one subject from one of the following fields: philosophy, science, religion, culture and historical events. It is akin to a seminar. The entire archive going back to 1998 is now available online in perpetuity.

An edition about Boudica was broadcast with Juliette Wood, Associate Lecturer in Folklore at Cardiff University; Richard Hingley, Professor of Roman Archaeology at Durham University; and Miranda Aldhouse-Green, Professor of Archaeology in the School of History and Archaeology at Cardiff University.

== Numbers and final battle ==
Some evidence following excavations by Reading University at Silchester suggested that the city was burned and destroyed with reliable dating to the Iceni uprising, although this isn't mentioned in the Roman record. If this is correct then not only are the Iceni and Trinovantes involved but the Silures and others. The Roman numbers of belligerants involved may not be so extreme after all.

The father and son team Peter and Dan Snow, in their TV series &quot;Battlefield Britain&quot; after having surveyed the Watling Street area from both air and ground, suggested Paulerspury near Milton Keynes as the most likely site of the final battle.[[User:AT Kunene|AT Kunene]] ([[User talk:AT Kunene|talk]]) 13:17, 17 January 2011 (UTC)

Another case of African's hijacking another culture (like Egypt for example) and claiming 'dibs'. Romans used slaves, slaves were from all different areas of the world. The word slave does not mean &quot;a black person who was forced to work&quot;, possibly comes from the word Slav. Repainting Boudica as black is actually quite racist in many peoples eyes...and is equal to calling Cleopatra black (she was Greek). I can only imagine what would happen if a fringe theorist suddenly decided that Dingane kaSenzangakhona Zulu of the Zulu Kingdom was actually a white chip shop owner from Essex. Martin Luthor King was a German wasn't he? People would feel a bit miffed with all this.
This is not history, it is silly.
Besides, as the person above me has already stated, the article linked never said black people - simply slaves...who were Celts.

I removed two cultural references:

''Boudica is discussed at length by [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] as an inspiration for carrying out the [[Jack the Ripper]] killings in the [[Alan Moore]] graphic novel [[From Hell]].''

''On the TV series [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]], during a challenge to convert second-hand cars into police cars, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] fitted his car with wheel spikes he referred to as &quot;Boadiceas&quot; in reference to the mythological spikes on the wheels of Boudica's chariot.

The first is uncited, does not appear in the article, links the real identity, and does not accord with my recollection of the &quot;inspiration&quot; for the murders. Boudica is perhaps mentioned in Moore's novel, as are a lot of other historical references, but I believe the threshold for inclusion would be a mention of this fact in an authoritative work about the subject of this article.

The second uses a primary source, casual references to Boudicea would number in the thousands, and it fails to meet this same threshold for inclusion. [[User talk:Cygnis insignis|cygnis insignis]] 18:58, 3 March 2012 (UTC)

== Titles ==
The original Roman account doesn't seem to refer to Boudica as &quot;Regnii&quot; or royal although she is referred to as the wife of Prasutagus. Although she is usually referred to as Queen  perhaps &quot;Chieftainess&quot; is the more accurate description.

It also seems unlikely that could have been a mass slaughter in Londinium. The inhabitents must have been aware of the slow moving mobs advancing on the town and evcuated to Gaul and the Roman towns in Kent. As most of these towns were the other side of the now gone Wantsum channel they would be easily defended and much safer.

The references to the Hispana legion seem uncertain. On the march the legion must have been strung out for several miles and it cannot have all been ambushed at the same time. Possibly sections were.

Had Cerialis lost a whole legion it seems unlikely that his career would have survived the inevitable courts martial. As it did and he eventually became a military Governor perhaps the legion being routed and having eventually regrouped it was too late to join Suetonius in time for the main battle.[[User:AT Kunene|AT Kunene]] ([[User talk:AT Kunene|talk]]) 09:55, 21 May 2012 (UTC)

== Flogging ==
Perhaps changing the context of Boudica's flogging may make the sequence of events clearer. If Nero was considering abandoning Britain he may well have ordered his agent, Catus Decianus, to make a final sweep for any portable valuable loot to swell the Imperial coffers. At the top of the list is the client kingdom of the late Prasutagus.

When the tax gatherers arrive on Boudica's door stop she may have tried to stop the looting and ended up being flogged as a warning to anybody else who got in the way. A Roman flogging usually resulted in the death of the victim so Boudica not only surviving the punishment but going on to raise a rebellion implies that she got off lightly.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:AT Kunene|AT Kunene]] ([[User talk:AT Kunene|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/AT Kunene|contribs]]) 10:10, 26 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== No it wasn't ==

== Namesake? ==
The names 'Boudica' and 'Victoria' aren't similar at all.  I'm not doubting that some people thought this, but why? Was King William's namesake Socrates?...that would make as much sense. Maybe explain that, please.[[User:77Mike77|77Mike77]] ([[User talk:77Mike77|talk]]) 19:53, 5 January 2013 (UTC)

== Original research, vocabulary mistake. ==
Re this sentence ,'It was in the Victorian era that Boudica's fame took on legendary proportions as Queen Victoria was seen to be Boudica's &quot;namesake&quot;', there is no citation, and the use of the word &quot;namesake&quot; is a mistake. I used Bing to research the quoted sentence, and there are two pages listing sites where the sentence appears essentially verbatim. One cannot tell which copy is the original, and for it to appear in a wikipedia article without a citation suggests it was just cut and pasted &quot;from the internet&quot;.  The word &quot;namesake&quot; is clearly misused; it does not mean that two completely different names have the same meaning when translated into different languages. Respected dictionaries have the same definitions, e.g. Collins, from dictionary.com:

1.	a person or thing named after another

2.	a person or thing with the same name as another

Re definition1, Queen Victoria was NOT named after Boudica. She was allegedly somehow identified with Boudica AFTER she became Queen (and there isn't a citation for that alleged phenomenon).

Re definition 2, the names Boudica and Victoria are not remotely the same! They end in &quot;a&quot;, that's all! Boudica has no V, T, nor R, while Victoria has no B, U, nor D. That is like saying that the word &quot;veranda&quot; was named after the &quot;bazooka&quot;, i.e. totally ridiculous.

Also, the word &quot;namesake&quot; is in &quot;scare quotes&quot;, indicating that the author is aware that the two are not really namesakes, and suggesting that people at the time abused the word &quot;namesake&quot; in the manner indicated. Yet there is no citation for this nonsense.

Because they are non-referenced and ridiculous, I suggest that the mentions of this &quot;namesake&quot; mistake be removed altogether, unless a citation can be provided.
A statue of Boudica was built during Victoria's reign, fine, but they were not &quot;namesakes&quot;.[[User:77Mike77|77Mike77]] ([[User talk:77Mike77|talk]]) 15:39, 17 February 2013 (UTC)

Another thing, this sentence - &quot;It was in the Victorian era that Boudica's fame took on legendary proportions as Queen Victoria was seen to be Boudica's &quot;namesake&quot;,...&quot; - implies a non-existent cause and effect, i.e. the word &quot;as&quot; suggests that there was a resurgence of interest in Boudicca ''because'' her Celtic name, when translated into English, has the same meaning as the Latin name Victoria when translated into English (i.e. &quot;Victory&quot;), whereas, in reality, it was not this quirk of name translations that caused the resurgence in interest in Boudica, but it was rather due to the English Renaissance, as mentioned earlier in the article. So that sentence appears to be both false and redundant.[[User:77Mike77|77Mike77]] ([[User talk:77Mike77|talk]]) 17:50, 19 February 2013 (UTC)

:Wikipedia articles are copied word-for-word on many websites. I don't see any problem with the use of &quot;namesake&quot; in quotes. It's certainly not original research. It's just a a way to communicate that the names are the same in a meaningful sense. You are making a mountain of a molehill. Yes, Boudica was known in the English Renaissance, but not to the extent that she was in the Victorian era. Actually, she's a bit of an idiot in Fletcher's play. Clearly, though, there is a connection to female monarchy in both periods. The Victoria/Boudica connection is clear in several sources [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SCUbpgTPeOgC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=victoria+boadicea&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BcAjUaS6F6qG0AXt34HYAw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=victoria%20boadicea&amp;f=false] [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zqSckpZ4DGgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=victoria+boudica+namesake&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q8EjUbyAOoe20QW194C4Bg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=victoria&amp;f=false]. She's even referred to as a &quot;namesake&quot; by the Victorians [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MFZIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA541&amp;dq=victoria+boadicea+namesake&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EsIjUcrkB4O_0QXXx4DwBQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=victoria%20boadicea%20namesake&amp;f=false The Gentleman's Magazine, 1854].  [[User:Paul Barlow|Paul B]] ([[User talk:Paul Barlow|talk]]) 18:09, 19 February 2013 (UTC)

Thanks for the comment. I didn't doubt that there was a connection of some kind. The article mentions a statue of Boudica being built in Victoria's time. My beef was that the article suggests that the resurgence of interest in Boudica was because of this quirk with the translated names, and that they were considered &quot;namesakes&quot; even though their names are entirely different. I am also interested in changing meanings of words. Today we would not say that Boudica and Victoria are &quot;the same&quot; or even &quot;similar&quot;, and their translations wouldn't enter into it, so the word &quot;namesake&quot; is clearly incorrect in modern usage. But if that is how they used it then, that is fine. The article, overall, is very good, I think. It is just that one thing that bothered me. The numbered references you gave support the uncontested view that there was a resurgence of interest in Boudica, but the Magazine reference is the one that uses the word &quot;namesake&quot; in this strange fashion, which is what I was after.[[User:77Mike77|77Mike77]] ([[User talk:77Mike77|talk]]) 20:25, 19 February 2013 (UTC)

Nitpicking, perhaps, but should her name be spelt with 1 or 2 c's?  The best contemporary source, Tacitus, has 2.

::Tacitus offered more than one spelling. Celtic linguists argue that two 'c's would be incorrect. However, what does correct mean? How she spelled her own name?

:::Sorry, I misremembered the section name above. It should have been &quot;Boudica's name&quot;. [[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] back in 2006 quoted the article by Jackson as saying &quot;The philological fact is that the name must have been ''Boudica'', pronounced in phonetic terminology /boudi:ka:/, in 'English' spelling it would be ' ''Bowdeekah'' ', where ''ow'' means the dipthong seen in e.g. the phrases 'tie a bow' or 'bow and arrow', and the stressed syllable is the ''dee'', with long vowel, the final ''a'' being also long. The generally accepted ''Boudicca'' is probably (and incorrectly) pronounced by most people as /budikə/, or, in popular spelling, ' ''Boodikka'' '.&quot; Jackson, at least in this passage, does not say that 'Boudica' with one &quot;c&quot; is &quot;correct&quot;, but does seem to obliquely imply that by criticising the version spelled with two &quot;c&quot;s. Perhaps the best approach would be to simply pop in the full quotation. I have notified Nicknack009, who is still active.

In any case, Wikipedia works on authority, and an authority is cited in support of the spelling used. It seemed on the basis of my reading to be the scholarly standard, and I sought out the most authoritative scholar I could find to demonstrate and justify that.

== Fiction/Music/Film section ==
I'm not a fan of bulleted lists, especially disorganized ones like I see attached to this article. When the article was evaluated for Featured Article status for a second time, [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Boudica 2]] in 2007, you were advised, &quot;I recommend removing all such trivia to a seperate [sic] article Boudicca in popular culture as soon as possible.&quot; Since you chose not to, I have some suggestions that I hope will make the list a little bit better.

List name: 

In the &quot;Cultural Depictions&quot; section, the sub-heading &quot;Fiction/Music/Film&quot; is very informal. In the first evaluation for Featured Article status [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Boudica 1]], 2005, the sub-headings were &quot;History and literature&quot;, &quot;Modern fiction&quot;, &quot;Films and television&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, and &quot;Other cultural references&quot;. These were simple and descriptive. Why were those titles ever changed? Although the items under each sub-heading weren't bulleted, they were a list nonetheless. (I'm happy to see that the bit about her &quot;ghost&quot; is gone.)

Organization: 

Unless there's some subtle logic that's escaping me, I see no over-arching organization of the list. It's not organized by date of creation of the works mentioned, alphabetically by creator or name of work, or even by type of work. It's obviously a list of randomly tacked-on, me-too items. Why not choose an organization criteria and sort the items by it?

Run-on list items: 

Some of the bulleted items start off by stating Boudica was the subject of films or novels, then runs off the rails by including dissimilar works. Examples -

* Change of subject: ''Boudica has been the subject of two feature '''films''', the 1928 film Boadicea, where she was portrayed by Phyllis Neilson-Terry,[46] and 2003's Boudica (Warrior Queen in the US), a UK TV film written by Andrew Davies and starring Alex Kingston as Boudica.[47] She has also been the subject of a 1978 British '''TV series''', Warrior Queen, starring Siân Phillips as Boudica. Jennifer Ward-Lealand portrayed Boudica in an episode of Xena: Warrior Princess titled &quot;The Deliverer&quot; in 1997.''

* Change of subject: ''Boudica's story is the subject of several '''novels''', including books by Rosemary Sutcliff, Roxanne Gregory, Pauline Gedge, Manda Scott, Alan Gold, Diana L. Paxson, David Wishart, George Shipway, Simon Scarrow, Mary Mackie and J. F. Broxholme (a pseudonym of Duncan Kyle). She plays a central role in the first part of G. A. Henty's novel Beric the Briton, and The Queen's Brooch, a children's novel by Henry Treece, is set during her rebellion. One of the viewpoint characters of Ian Watson's novel Oracle is an eyewitness to her defeat. She has also appeared in several '''comic book''' series, including the Sláine, which featured two runs, titled &quot;Demon Killer&quot; and &quot;Queen of Witches&quot; giving a free interpretation of Boudica's story. Other comic appearances include Witchblade and From Hell. The DC Comics character Boodikka, a member of the Green Lantern Corps, was named after Boudica. Additionally, in the alternate history novel Ruled Britannia by Harry Turtledove, Boudicca is the subject of a play written by William Shakespeare to incite the people of Britain to revolt against Spanish conquerors.''

Plain quirkiness:

* Singer/songwriter Enya is found in two of the listed items.
* In this item, &quot;''Martha Howe-Douglas played Boudica in Horrible Histories.''&quot;, one must follow the link to discover that ''Horrible Histories'' is a &quot;''UK children's sketch comedy television series''&quot;.
* In &quot;''She appears as a character in the Xbox One exclusive game Ryse: Son of Rome.''&quot;, what does &quot;exclusive&quot; signify? Why is is it not merely &quot;game&quot;? That &quot;exclusive&quot; inclusion sounds like marketing.
* If you follow the link to this item, &quot;''In the fictional world of Ghosts of Albion, Queen Bodicea is one of three Ghosts who once were mystical protectors. . .''&quot;, Boudica is not mentioned at all. There's no non-WP source given, either.
* Following this link to its WP article, there's no mention of Boudica: &quot;''Boudicca is a character in the animated series Gargoyles.[48]''&quot;. The reference link given, #48, returns a blank page. The IMDb page for this show does not mention Boudica in its long list of characters: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108783/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast
* Following the WP link to The Libertines, Boudica is not mentioned under any spelling: &quot;''. . .British rock band The Libertines, refer to her under the alternate spelling (&quot;If Queen Boadicea is long dead and gone. . .)''&quot; There's no non-WP source given, either.
* There's ''another'' cultural impact section called &quot;''Other cultural references''&quot; with two more items listed. If one culture section is good, then two are better?

If these works cannot be discussed in paragraphs (I realize that lists are easier, but paragraphs yield more interesting information, in my opinion), can they at least be cleaned up and organized?

== Rape ==

== Client kings having to give their kingdoms to Rome ==


Regarding “It was normal Roman practice to allow allied kingdoms their independence only for the lifetime of their client king, who would then agree to leave his kingdom to Rome in his will,” this is not true. There is no ancient sourced which states this. Client states remained semi-autonomous entities when their ruler died and he was succeeded by a local man. Many client kingdoms were eventually annexed and usually this was connected o local political instability. The two examples given are wrong.  Galatia became a Roman client kingdom in 64 BC and remained so until 25 BC. It was originally ruled by thee chiefs and then Deiotarus became the king of most of this territory. When 
Deiotarus. Galatia was not annexed. Instead, the Romans appointed Amyntas, a Galatian as the king, to avoid fights between the Galatians over the succession. When Amyntas was murdered Augustus annexed Galatia. This was because Amyntas had been unpopular among his people and attacked and killed a prince. His murder was a revenge act for this. Galatia was annexed to maintain its stability. Although the last king of Bithynia, Nicomedes IV, was pretty much a puppet of the Romans, Bithynia was not a Roman client state. It was an ally. We do not know why Nicomedes IV bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. Presumably he had no heir. Moreover, Bithynia was under the threat of the kingdom of Pontus.

Judea was a client state of Rome from 64 BC to AD. During this time it was initially ruled by Hyrcanus. After Hyrcanus, Caesar installed Antip[ater. Antipater was succeeded by his son Herod the great, who in turn was succeeded by his sons, among whom he had partitioned his kingdom. Augustus deposed Archelaus in 6 BC on the request by the Jews, who were fed up with misrule. It was then that Judea was annexed.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:020amonra|020amonra]] ([[User talk:020amonra|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/020amonra|contribs]]) 11:05, 9 December 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

The language that you say is false seems to derive directly from this article, page 176:  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/302174/_Boudicas_Speeches_in_Tacitus_and_Dio&lt;/ref&gt;_
Below, it cites where the idea came from: &lt;ref&gt;D. Braund, “Royal Wills and Rome,” PBSR 51 (1983) esp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;
If we're going by sources rather than one's feeling it is not true based on some anecdotal evidence of client kingdoms where such things did not happen, perhaps the language should be restored, with a proper citation.
