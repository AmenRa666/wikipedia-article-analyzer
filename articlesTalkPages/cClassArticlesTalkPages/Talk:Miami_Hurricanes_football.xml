==Sources==
*The ''Cane Mutiny'' book is a good, independent source, but over 20 references to it still have missing page references.
*The football team's Media Guide is not a good source, because it is published by UM and contains self-serving statements.  Ideally, other sources should be found if possible. To the extent that it is used, page references should be added. Thanks, [[User:Racepacket|Racepacket]] ([[User talk:Racepacket|talk]]) 13:23, 31 October 2009 (UTC)
** Again, please join in the effort to better source this article. Thanks, [[User:Racepacket|Racepacket]] ([[User talk:Racepacket|talk]]) 23:08, 7 November 2009 (UTC)
*** Many page cites are missing from the PDF sources.  Please help. Thanks, [[User:Racepacket|Racepacket]] ([[User talk:Racepacket|talk]]) 22:38, 17 January 2010 (UTC)
==Phrasing==
Remember, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a sports-writer blog. Some of the writing seems to take UM's perspective rather than describing events from a neutral point of view. Thanks, [[User:Racepacket|Racepacket]] ([[User talk:Racepacket|talk]]) 16:27, 20 February 2010 (UTC)

== Graig Cooper ==

Im happy hes not leaving to the NFL this year hes a great part of this team look at this

==Jon Gruden ==
{{tld|editprotected}}
Gruden has explicitly stated that he is committed to ESPN (http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5861615&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NFLHeadlines) (though this doesn't mean he won't be the head coach for UM). However, per a search of google and every other source,  Jon Gruden is NOT the current head coach at the University of Miami; no head coach has been named, and the interim head coaching position has been filled by the former offensive line coach, Jeff Stoutland (see http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112810aaa.html). As such, the head coaching position should be changed to Jeff Stoutland (or none, or something similar) and the &quot;Jon Gruden era&quot; section should be removed. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Rankinr|Rankinr]] ([[User talk:Rankinr|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rankinr|contribs]]) 06:41, November 29, 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:[[File:Red information icon with gradient background.svg|20px|link=|alt=]] '''Not done for now:'''&lt;!-- Template:EP --&gt;. There seems to currently be an active dispute over this. You may make the edit once the protection is lifted. Until then, all involved editors are encouraged to discuss this to establish a final definitive consensus. -- [[User:OlEnglish|&lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&amp;oelig;&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:OlEnglish|&lt;sup&gt;&amp;trade;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 07:01, 29 November 2010 (UTC)
::It seems a bit irresponsible to leave something which has no support in the article during the protection period. I agree it's good to let cooler heads prevail, but there is nothing but speculation that Gruden is taking over. It's not [[WP:V]] and it shouldn't be in the article yet. [[User:Cliffhanger407|Cliffhanger407]] ([[User talk:Cliffhanger407|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cliffhanger407|contribs]]) 14:32, 29 November 2010 (UTC)

This is precisely why Wikipedia gets such a bad rap. It's pointless to discuss when, if you were to click on the links provided, you would see the facts of the situation. [[Special:Contributions/129.171.233.75|129.171.233.75]] ([[User talk:129.171.233.75|talk]]) 02:41, 30 November 2010 (UTC)
==Citations==
When citing to books such as the ''Cane Mutiny'' page numbers are required.  Please add page numbers to each footnote that refers to a book or a long document. Thanks. [[User:Racepacket|Racepacket]] ([[User talk:Racepacket|talk]]) 11:37, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
==Overlapping articles==
This article copied verbatim the history section of the media book.  We fixed that in October 2009 and it has now grown to 129,404 bytes.  On June 27, 2009, before the copyright fix user Levineps copied the article and began [[History of Miami Hurricanes football]] which is now 64,101 bytes. What is our plan for the relationship between the two articles? Thanks, [[User:Racepacket|Racepacket]] ([[User talk:Racepacket|talk]]) 12:05, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
:Apparently, the History article borrows heavily from the football media guide and has copyright problems. [[User:Racepacket|Racepacket]] ([[User talk:Racepacket|talk]]) 19:10, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
::Thank you for pointing out this previously undiscovered spinoff problem. The [[derivative work]] article has been deleted. I have replaced it with a split from this article but not removed the content from here, with summary. I'll leave that to you and other fans of the football team. --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:46, 4 January 2011 (UTC)
:::Because the history section here is identical to what was left there, I merged the article with a redirect. [[User:Racepacket|Racepacket]] ([[User talk:Racepacket|talk]]) 22:12, 16 January 2011 (UTC)

== RV of &quot;Death Penalty&quot; Innuendo ==

Several of us editors have been having a lively time of it keeping the [[Talk:Death penalty (NCAA)]] article clean of non-factual supposition. The &quot;source&quot; for the sentence I removed here is Pat Forde, a columnist for ESPN - not an investigative reporter and certainly not an NCAA COI official. Any suggestion that Miami is a) guilty of any of these infractions or b) is in danger of the death penalty is '''completely speculative''' and has no place in a factual article about the football program at Miami. Forde can speculate to his heart's content because he is a columnist - but that kind of thing belongs in a blog, or on an op-ed page, or in the national Enquirer - but it's gossip and entirely unworthy of an encyclopedia. The sentences that remain in that section are factual and sourced from[[WP:RS]], which Forde is not for '''facts''' regarding this case. I invite interested parties to take a glance at the Talk page referenced above for more. [[User:Sensei48|Sensei48]] ([[User talk:Sensei48|talk]]) 00:17, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

== Nav box standardization ==

The rigid standardization of football team nav box templates is being discussed at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject College football#Team navboxes|College football Wikiproject]]. Editors pursuing this standardization have already significantly altered the [[Template:Miami Hurricanes football navbox|Miami Hurricane football navbox]], and you may wish to review these changes add your input.
