==Notice==
The notice on ''&quot;Swedish mother tongue per se not being much of a handicap&quot;'' is, as far as I know both seemingly correct and interesting in an international context. However, I wonder if President [[Svinhufvud]] wasn't a Swedophone too?

In my opinion it's also interesting to note that Finland-Swedes could reach the top level also in other parties, as the Conservatives and the Social Democrats.&lt;br&gt;

    * fishermen and farmers from the Swedish-speaking coastal areas,
    * small-town dwellers from the adjacent Swedish-speaking towns,
    * green-minded and left-leaning middle-class intellectuals and cultural elite, and
    * rightist-inclined economic liberals from Helsinki.

Could this passage please be changed to the following:
    * fishermen and farmers,
    * small-town dwellers,
    * green-minded and left-leaning middle-class intellectuals and cultural elite, and
    * rightist-inclined economic liberals.
&quot;Why?&quot;,you ask me. Because the partys members shouldn't be classified based on their homeplace. There are many &quot;rightist-inclined economic liberals&quot; from other parts from Finland than from Helsinki, not all farmers are from the costal areas etc.

Jakke

:The first version is right. Simply because the are no SFP representation (or party structure in small finnish-speaking towns let alone in the countryside. Its not possible to vote for SFP f.ex. in [[Lieksa]] as no SFP member has ever been candidate there (other than European and presidential elections), and this is true of the uni-lingual finnish-speaking municipalities in general. &quot;Because the partys members shouldn't be classified based on their homeplace&quot; but they are, that's the nature of the system. 

:Here's what i suggest:
    * fishermen and farmers from the Swedish-speaking coastal areas,
    * small-town dwellers from the adjacent Swedish-speaking and bi-lingual towns,
    * green-minded and left-leaning middle-class intellectuals and cultural elite, and
    * rightist-inclined economic liberals
:This represents the vast majority without unnecessary ambiguity. [[User:213.243.181.212|213.243.181.212]] 12:05, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

I agree with Jakke. The listing that places rightist-inclinid liberals in Helsinki etc. is kind of prejudiced. Even though it is partly true, it is not relevant. Neither is &quot;Swedish-speaking&quot; this'n that, since the party has som finnish speaking supporters, even though they are not many. - CEB

Why is there a link to the article of [[fascism]]? Is don't understand, SFP is not in anyway a party that has any conection to faccsism. Sfp has actually advocated for minority rights and anti-faccsim. It sounds to me a litebit fenno-nationalism? // [[User: Dr.Poison]]

== Center-right? ==

A social liberal part as center-right? By most standards, including here in the U.S., social liberalism is considered a center-left ideology. Perhaps there needs to be a note in the infobox that by Swedish, as opposed to international standards, social liberalism is not considered a center-left ideology. &lt;b&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; color=&quot;1F860E&quot;&gt;[[User:BrendelSignature|Signature]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;20038A&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User:BrendelSignature|brendel]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 03:34, 18 November 2007 (UTC)
