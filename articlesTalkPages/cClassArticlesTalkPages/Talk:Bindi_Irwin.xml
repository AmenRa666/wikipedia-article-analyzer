==Impossible facts==
&quot;Bindi made her first television appearance on the The Rosie O'Donnell Show in 1989.&quot;
There is no way that is possible if she was born in 1998.  I'm thinking that's a typo, but honestly that entire sentance should be removed.  It doesn't belong where it is placed, and has no relevance to the article as a whole.
[[User:69.66.91.45|69.66.91.45]] 04:48, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
*It's a typo. Bindi's parents DID bring her with them on the TV show a matter off months after she was born.--[[User:Marhawkman|Marhawkman]] 04:45, 31 May 2007 (UTC)
**For that matter, her birth was filmed and is featured in the Crocodile Hunter series (episode 1) [[User:Youcantryreachingme|youcantryreachingme]] 11:36, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

==I have a recent photo==
I have a photo from January 2007 which &lt;s&gt;I could make available for this article. It can be seen at the bottom of [[http://www.wherelightmeetsdark.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=58 this page]] - click for larger version. I have no experience with contributing photos to Wikipedia, however. Would anyone like to fast-track me? (use contact form on that site (under &quot;WLMD&quot; menu), or user talk page here on wikipedia) [[User:Youcantryreachingme|youcantryreachingme]] 12:40, 17 July 2007 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt; I have just added to the article.

==Bindi overworked==
Hi I was just wondering why there are no references on this wikipage abut worrys that she is being over worked because of family worrys that busness will slowly die off at there zoo since her dad passed away? --[[User:MattyC3350|MattyC3350]] 09:48, 30 October 2007 (UTC)

:I would imagine no such reference would exist, as basically that would involve her mother, or someone closely connected to her, publicly stating, &quot;Bindi is overworked because we're worried we won't have jobs if she slows down.&quot;  Which of course, would never be said to the public even if it WERE true.  

:Personally, I would think that continuing Steve's work is proving helpful with the grieving period to a young girl who's lost her father.  I was the same age when I lost my father unexpectedly, and I floundered around feeling helpless and hopeless.  Eight year old kids don't usually have much &quot;power of action&quot; and so I think people should admire what she's doing.  She needs to do it, in a very real way that few people can understand.  When and if it gets to the point that being Bindi, Defender of Wildlife&quot; is no longer helping her situation, I think you can well assured she'll quit as a television personality.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/209.30.198.96|209.30.198.96]] ([[User talk:209.30.198.96|talk]]) 16:10, 3 November 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Thanksgiving's Day Parade==
Hello. I was just writing because i believe that I saw her in the thanksgiving day parade performing a song about endangered animals but it does not say anything about this in the actual article.  Is it not relevent?  I believe that it was a great milestone in her career and should be mentioned.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/68.114.55.102|68.114.55.102]] ([[User talk:68.114.55.102|talk]]) 17:33, 29 December 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:Probably because you havent provided a reference to anywhere that it can be verified.

:I agree and I just removed the recently-added &quot;personal life&quot; section. The reference was [http://womansday.ninemsn.com.au/celebrity/inthemag/1015231/meet-bindi-irwins-boyfriend this] which states that the two people concerned live in different countries, so it seems reasonable to conclude that the information is not suitable for an encyclopedic article.

==dirtgirlworld==
I actually own a fansite for Bindi and one of our admins posted information about Bindi and dirtgirlworld. I was promptly emailed by the creator of dirtgirlworld that Bindi is not affiliated with them in any way (voice, presenter, etc.), and I removed the news item and posted about what happened. This is a rumor that has been going around the web for a while now, but it isn't true. [[User:Stephe1987|Stephe1987]] ([[User talk:Stephe1987|talk]]) 06:19, 20 May 2011 (UTC)

==Age and status as philosopher==
i think &quot;espouses the conservationist philosophy as her parents&quot; is a somewhat overblown statement to apply to a childs point of view. Can we at least wait a couple years before applying such language? Ive no doubt she is committed to conservation, but she is not old enough to be considered a philosopher, only an advocate.(mercurywoodrose)[[User:Mercurywoodrose|Mercurywoodrose]] ([[User talk:Mercurywoodrose|talk]]) 06:42, 9 July 2011 (UTC)

Philosophy following makes you a philosopher it does not. - Yoda  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/220.253.81.172|220.253.81.172]] ([[User talk:220.253.81.172|talk]]) 11:06, 29 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Epistemologically, it's not sensible to pronounce s.o. to be sharing (or espousing) a philosophy, especially one so easily attributed even to historical personalities, just by subjectively and personally relating that subject to that generalization. Even with the (very broad) term 'philosophy' that semms to be employed here, it just doesn't make any sense, besides not being quoted or related or whatever. cheers.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/93.222.28.92|93.222.28.92]] ([[User talk:93.222.28.92|talk]]) 01:03, 19 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Bindi Irwin's perfect scores, 7 or 8? ==

There is a discrepancy. We state &quot;the most perfect scores with seven&quot;, but I count eight, and [http://www.enstarz.com/articles/122179/20151125/dwts-cast-winner-how-bindi-irwin-made-history-broke-records-this-season-with-derek-hough.htm this source] also says eight. Which is it? -- [[User:BullRangifer|BullRangifer]] ([[User talk:BullRangifer|talk]]) 05:27, 30 November 2015 (UTC)
: I see that there is a hidden editorial note at [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 21)]] &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--NOTE: 7 is the correct number. The 30 Bindi Irwin and Alexa PenaVega received for their Charleston in week 9 is not included. They danced that routine as a team, and perfect scores danced by teams are not reflected in each individual celebrity's total.--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
: What justification do we have for counting in this manner? Is there a RS from the official DWTS organization regarding this? -- [[User:BullRangifer|BullRangifer]] ([[User talk:BullRangifer|talk]]) 06:06, 30 November 2015 (UTC)

== External links modified ==

Hello fellow Wikipedians,

I have just added archive links to {{plural:1|one external link|1 external links}} on [[Bindi Irwin]].

== books ==

I was hoping to find a list of the books she's authored, since Wikipedia is so often a great source for that information, particularly because it lists titles without cover photos, so it is easy to copy/paste to a document for tracking titles read.  Unfortunately, there isn't even a mention of her having written any books at all.
