== The model for Tony Stark? ==

On American TV at the time was the TV series [[Hawaiian Eye]] (started 1959), starring [[Anthony Eisley]] as Tracy Steel, a playboy kind of detective in Hawaii. As well as the same initials as Tony Stark (also Tony as in Anthony), Steel looked like the early Stark with the same pencil mustache, hair style and build. ([[User:Cyberia3|Cyberia3]] ([[User talk:Cyberia3|talk]]) 20:49, 27 July 2011 (UTC))
: Is there any corroboration for this at all, other than superficial similarities? In the documentary about the creation of the comic-book character which came on some versions of the DVD for the first ''Iron Man'' movie, Stan Lee gives an interview in which he says that he was specifically looking to make Tony Stark similar to Howard Hughes, in which case the parallels in looks and back-ground would also be met. Perhaps ''Hawaiian Eye'' also used Howard Hughes as the “go-to” billionaire playboy industrialist template? [[User:Jock123|Jock123]] ([[User talk:Jock123|talk]]) 15:29, 1 July 2014 (UTC)

== Semi-protected edit request on 31 October 2014 ==

{{edit semi-protected|Iron Man|answered=yes}}
&lt;!-- Begin request --&gt;
Hello, my name is Scott Russell, and I was hoping that you could add my website link to this wikipedia page.  I just created this website and was hoping to get some traffic to it.  Below is the link to the website.  It is not fully done.  I plan on adding descriptions of the 42 suits of armor in the near future.  As for the distant future, I plan to do a lot more.  Here is the link, check it out: http://suitsofiron.com/index.html .

Thanks,
Scott Russell

[[:Iron Man]] → {{no redirect|Iron Man (comics)}} – We all love Tony Stark, but I just don't think the character really meets our [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC]] criteria. Maybe he's the single most popular subject compared to the [[Iron Man (disambiguation)|many other uses]], but more so than all others combined? I don't think so. The various sports uses and the Black Sabbath song are also quite prominent. The comics character actually only makes four of the top 10 Google Books results for ''&quot;iron man&quot; -wikipedia'', even though Iron Man comics are included in the results. He's better represented in Google results, but even there, the Ironman triathlon makes the first page and most results are actually about the 2008 movie rather than the character himself.

I hate to think about how much cleanup this is going to entail, but I'm willing to do my part on that front. [[WP:RECENT|In the long run]], I think this is worth it. --[[User:BDD|BDD]] ([[User talk:BDD|talk]]) 18:53, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Lots of other uses doesn't mean the comic book character isn't the primary topic. RECENTISM wouldn't apply either since the character predates both the Black Sabbath song and the triathlon, which is Ironman anyway, not Iron Man. [[User:Calidum|Calidum]] [[User talk:Calidum|T]]&amp;#124;[[Special:Contributions/Calidum|C]] 19:27, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' per Calidum. Easily the primary subject by this name, and the different naming of the Ironman Triathlon weakens the need to distinguish that topic even further. '''[[User:Postdlf|postdlf]]''' (''[[User talk:Postdlf|talk]]'') 22:17, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' this is ambiguous disambiguation and fails [[WP:PRECISE]] as there are multiple comics properties (and multiple Marvel Comics properties; and multiple comics characters) that may be referred to as &quot;Iron Man&quot;. This article is a fictional character article, so if it is not the primary topic and therefore should move, should be called [[Iron Man (Marvel Comics character)]]; the nominator's proposed title should then redirect to the disambiguation page -- [[Special:Contributions/70.51.203.69|70.51.203.69]] ([[User talk:70.51.203.69|talk]]) 04:02, 25 June 2015 (UTC)

==Fictional character biography==
The rampant fictography of the &quot;Fictional character biography&quot; section in this article violates so many Wikipedia guidelines on writing about fiction, such as [[WP:NOT#PLOT]] and [[WP:INUNIVERSE]]. We've had this discussion already several times in the past, leading to the deletion of fictography comics articles. (See [
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fictional_history_of_Spider-Man&amp;oldid=405598493],[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fictional_history_of_Green_Goblin], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Fictional_history_of_Wolverine_(2nd_nomination)].) The same tenets apply here. In this blow-by-blow, arc-by-arc FCB, the 2000s take up 1,470 words and the 2010s, which we're not even fully halfway through, already take up ''over 1,800 words''. The 1960s, in which most of the mythos and major characters were established, runs only 531 words! 

There's no reason for this. I hope other editors will pitch in, since it's a big job, but this FCB needs serious condensing now. --[[User:Tenebrae|Tenebrae]] ([[User talk:Tenebrae|talk]]) 01:18, 2 July 2015 (UTC)</text>
