==Drone doom?==
What's the difference between this and drone doom metal, already covered in [[doom metal]]? [[User:5theye|= ∫]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:5theye|t]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/5theye|c]]&lt;/sup&gt; [[User:5theye|5th Eye]] 17:42, 18 August 2008 (UTC)

:It's actually called drone doom and they're the same thing I think. Drone metal is just another term that is used for drone doom (or is it vice versa?) so it should have been created there instead. −'''&lt;font color=&quot;#000062&quot;&gt;[[User:CircafuciX|₪ÇɨгcaғucɨҲ₪]]&lt;/font&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:CircafuciX|&lt;font color=&quot;#082567&quot;&gt;kaiden &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;''' 05:10, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

:::::I agree, this article needs to be re-directed to [[doom metal#drone doom]] again. I have no idea why it was resurrected.

I resurrected this article, and did so because there's a good source (The New York Times) that indicates that drone metal is its own genre. It's worth having its own page; it comes from a lineage in doom metal, but has a number of other influences besides. The &quot;drone doom&quot; subsection cites no sources and is inadequate to this topic. [[User:Aryder779|Aryder779]] ([[User talk:Aryder779|talk]]) 14:17, 22 August 2008 (UTC)

:Of course drone doom/drone metal is a defined genre, but it's a subgenre of doom metal nonetheless. Right now, the article doesn't contain much more than what's already written (at doom metal) and it only uses ''one'' reliable source. The infobox lists ''ten'' genres as stylistic origins, yet none of those have sources to support them. Unless this article is greatly expanded and sourced, I see no reason to keep it.

:: I just added a number of additional sources. Incidentally: &quot;Sunn o))) place themselves in a lineage that stretches from the garage-rock sublime of bands like the Seeds and Blue Cheer to the squalling massed-guitar orchestrations of Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca,&quot; from the Artforum article. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_8_44/ai_n18764233] Not a word about doom metal here. Drone metal is as much a subgenre of drone music or minimalist music as it is a subgenre of doom metal. [[User:Aryder779|Aryder779]] ([[User talk:Aryder779|talk]]) 14:53, 22 August 2008 (UTC)

:::That's fine by me, but I think it should be moved to [[Drone doom metal]] as that is the standard name for it and also the name used in [[doom metal]].

::::I agree with 5th Eye but I think it should be [[drone doom]] as it is the correct link title and is where the original history was. Drone metal is just another term for drone doom, like heavy rock is to hard rock and it also will be consistent with the other doom subgenres.

:::::I'm sorry, but this is your POV.

It's not straightforward that these are synonymous terms, and certainly not that &quot;drone doom&quot; should be the preferred term. What evidence do you have that drone doom is the &quot;standard name for it&quot;? [[User:Aryder779|Aryder779]] ([[User talk:Aryder779|talk]]) 14:23, 23 August 2008 (UTC)

::::::I'm sorry as well since I thought you were &quot;in the wrong&quot; when you created the article out of the redirect but now as I look at the sources, it seems more understandable to me as to why you created it here. Then again, it may be the press/reviewers/etc. that are pushing the name of the genre. The title of drone metal basically blows any mention of doom out of the water though. I guess this chat has ended for the time being. −'''&lt;font color=&quot;#000062&quot;&gt;[[User:CircafuciX|₪ÇɨгcaғucɨҲ₪]]&lt;/font&gt;  &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:CircafuciX|&lt;font color=&quot;#082567&quot;&gt;kaiden &lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;''' 03:20, 25 August 2008 (UTC)

== Drone metal and doom metal ==

I think it's important to discuss the degree to which drone metal is indebted to doom metal.&lt;br&gt;
Earth and Burning Witch get their main influence from the Melvins. Now, the Melvins are generally considered the beginning of sludge metal (or even &quot;sludge doom&quot;), unless Eyehategod gets that honor. But, as it turns out, the Melvins come from a hardcore punk lineage much more than anything like doom metal. [http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/the-melvins-king-buzzo-lays-do/] I don't want to deny that Earth, Sunn O))), Boris and other drone metal groups have a connection to doom metal, and John Wray discusses this in his NY Times article. But to be clear, other than the Saint Vitus reissue on Southern Lord, there's not much debt that's ever been announced by drone metal groups to doom metal groups. Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General, Pentagram -- these are good bands, but not bands I've heard drone metal groups ever cite as an influence. My point is that drone metal is not necessarily &quot;drone doom metal&quot;. It could just as easily be called &quot;drone sludge metal&quot; or &quot;drone black metal&quot;. Sunn O))) apparently call themselves &quot;power ambient&quot;. So, I don't know, &quot;drone ambient metal&quot; is just as sensible. My point is that a merger with doom metal is not an idea that makes sense. [[User:Aryder779|Aryder779]] ([[User talk:Aryder779|talk]]) 15:56, 24 August 2008 (UTC)

Butalthough the Melvins started out as a hardcore punk band; they switched to what later became known as 'sludge metal' (which has clear connections to doom metal in general) later on-their background is pretty much irrelevant. Essentially; drone doom is what happens when you take Sludge metal to an even greater extreme in terms of slowness and heaviness. Not to mention the influence doom bands like Burning Witch (and indeed early Black Sabbath-although it would be wrong to call Black Sabbath 'doom as such'-indeed the name of the band 'Earth' was a tribute to Black Sabath) had on drone doom.[[Special:Contributions/92.3.157.247|92.3.157.247]] ([[User talk:92.3.157.247|talk]]) 15:39, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

Only bands that have articles, at least, should be included in the list of prominent bands of the 21st century. Please discuss here before reverting again.

:Agreed. If they do not have their own article they are pretty unlikely to be prominent. It is also true that all bands listed should have a supporting citation as a [[WP:RS]].--'''&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Black Chancery;text:grey 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;[[User:Sabrebd|&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;SabreBD&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Sabrebd|talk&lt;/span&gt;]]) 07:26, 25 October 2010 (UTC)
