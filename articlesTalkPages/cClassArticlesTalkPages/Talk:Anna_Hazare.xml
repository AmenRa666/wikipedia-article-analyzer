== Criticism Section==

Ridiculously biased article - one needs to compare this with Sonia Gandhi's article with a total absence of criticism. Why the double standards in bios here in wikipedia? Are congress junkies editing so much content to manipulate wikipedia articles?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/202.78.251.130|202.78.251.130]] ([[User talk:202.78.251.130|talk]]) 11:24, 1 August 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

Highly biased article. The criticism is shrouded in sections to obfuscate the details. Wikipedia needs to take non partisan stand when writing the history.Some one please start new section where his criticism can be easily read. as,yhwh 11:34, 16 August 2011 (UTC)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:As.yhwh|As.yhwh]] ([[User talk:As.yhwh|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/As.yhwh|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:: I have added a section on corruption charges. Other possible subsections here include
* Views on death penalty
* Allegations of attempts to undermine the parliament
* Allegation of flogging
Please add your comments [[User:Anupkc|Anup]] ([[User talk:Anupkc|talk]]) 19:50, 17 August 2011 (UTC)

:: I think we should expand the criticism section. Anna Hazare supports violent punishment like [[Flogging]] and sources say that he used his Army belt to beat up a person who drunk alcohol at a nearby village. Anna also wants corroupt people to be hanged, which is barberic violent [[Capital Punishment]]. Mahatama Gandhi was against ALL violence, so Anna cannot claim to be a Gandhian.[[User:Thinkspank101|Thinkspank101]] ([[User talk:Thinkspank101|talk]]) 16:33, 22 August 2011 (UTC)

:::Actually, Wikipedia's [[WP:NPOV]] policy explicitly says that we're ''not'' supposed to have a separate criticism section, because that gives it undue weight.  In general, criticism ''should be'' embedded throughout the article, except where the criticism is a major part of what makes the person notable. [[User:Qwyrxian|Qwyrxian]] ([[User talk:Qwyrxian|talk]]) 06:45, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

::::::: I can only think of one way of doing away with it,that is we can make a separate section like 'Views about politicians' or something similar to it.I expect more suggestion regarding this,so all active editors,kindly let everyone know about your views.Once we reach a final consensus over this matter,we will remove the 'controversies and criticism' section,but will make sure that each and every sourced information of that section must be retained in the article.

:This article is essentially puffery, written by Hazare or one of his fanatics.  &quot;Much-acclaimed popular Indian social activist&quot; reads like one of his propaganda articles.

==Corruption case against Anna Hazare==

Anna Hazare, by his own admission is facing 10 to12 cases at various places in the state of Maharashtra. One such case relates to misappropriation of funds in Hind Swaraj Trust at Ralegan Siddhi to celebrate his 61st birthday in 2005. The complaint has been filed under sections 406 and 409 of the Indian Penal Code.as,yhwh 20:07, 13 August 2011 (UTC)
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Patil-demands-transfer-of-case-filed-against-Hazare/articleshow/8084496.cms

: I think this issue should be mentioned in the this article. It is not necessarily an corruption issue but point that he used an trust's money worth more that 2 lakhs for his birthday celebrations in an poor country like India certainly deserves to be mentioned.

:: Here we are discussing about the possible misuse of fund in thousands by Anna Hazare but corrupt politicians and govt. officials are doing the misuse in crores. Please see the link: http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/congress-accuses-anna-of-corruption-126539 
'''''Responding to the allegations Mr Hazare said, ''The government is defaming me. The Sawant committee does not say that I am corrupt.'' On the question on the celebration of his birthday, he added. ''I've never celebrated my birthday. There were some people who wanted to celebrate it, but the trust money was returned. So where is the corruption?'''''

I think this information should also go to this wiki article under subsection &quot;Anti-corruption protests in Maharashtra&quot;. Thanks!

== Name is Wrongly Spelled ==
In Marathi Language 'Z'(झ) is not used for any pronunciation of J(ज),
All pronunciations of Devanagari words beginning with J(ज) are written in J only not Z.Z is strictly used for JH word where pronunciation is distinct from normal J.Its हजारे and not हझारे ,In Hindi Devanagari Z is used to denote such a distinction of pronunciation.e.g.Santacruz is written as सांताक्रुझ and not like the Hindi word सांताक्रुज.Maza or Majha-माझा/मझा and Maja-मजा/माजा .
Please change the article name to '''HAJARE'''
* Marathi Hazare- हझारे
* Hindi  Hazare- हजारे
'''Marathi Devanagari has different set of rules of grammar than all other Devanagari script based languages like Hindi,Bhojapuri etc.'''

==English Translation of Name==
Does Marathi Hazare and Hindi Hazare mean the number 1000? I just wanted to be sure about tranlating the name to English. I think it means 1000 (or several Thousand) eggs. Can anyone clearify if hazare  means one thousand, or several thousands?. Please update the english tranlation ot the name. Thanks.

The name Anna does not mean eggs. It is something of an honorific frequently used in Maharashtra to refer to an elder person.

:: First,Anna Hazare,does not translates to 'eggs',it has nothing to do with it. Hazare 'vaguely' translates to 'thousand'(Hazar)                  Second,is there really a need to translate a person's name into English??[[User:Maverick.Mohit|Maverick.Mohit]] ([[User talk:Maverick.Mohit|talk]]) 19:44, 17 August 2011 (UTC)

The name Anna in English does originate with the meaning &quot;Gracious&quot; or even &quot;Merciful&quot;, but most people in the West do associate the name with the feminine gender. So it will be a topic of discussion cross-culturally. [[User:Thedoctor98|Thedoctor98]] ([[User talk:Thedoctor98|talk]]) 08:46, 30 August 2011 (UTC)

This material needs to be consolidated into a tighter narrative. This is beyone the scope of routine copy editors so I have not done it. --[[User:Diannaa|&lt;span style=&quot;color:teal;&quot;&gt;Diannaa&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User talk:Diannaa|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 00:51, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

==[[WP:BLPSTYLE]] guidelines and controversies section of the article==

[[WP:BLPSTYLE]] guidelines clearly state &quot;Criticism and praise should be included if they can be sourced to reliable secondary sources, so long as the material is presented responsibly, conservatively, and in a disinterested tone. Do not give disproportionate space to particular viewpoints; the views of tiny minorities should not be included at all. &lt;u&gt;Care must be taken with article structure to ensure the overall presentation&lt;/u&gt; and section headings are broadly neutral.&quot;

But it seems an editor is interested to repeat the Anna Hazare related part of the P. B. Sawant Commission report once again in the controversies section, though it is already mentioned in a preceding section. I deleted his edit twice, as it is not conforming with above policy. I want to know the opinions of the other editors on the issue.

==Insufficient references, low quality article==
This article suffers from quite a few claims that are not supported by the links provided. I.e.: the Hindu article linked to in support of the claim that &quot;caste divisions have been eradicated in the village just quotes a press release that says Anna has done a lot to eradicate caste divisions. 

Similarly, citation 16 - Springs of life: India's water resources - does not seem to deal with Anna Hazare at all but it just appears to be a Google books result for Anna Hazare and alcoholism. It also does not support the claim that the liquor stores that were destroyed by youths were illegal. I have serious reservations about whether this article meets Wikipedia's usual quality standards and is a reliable source of information on Anna... --[[User:Naimless|Naimless]] ([[User talk:Naimless|talk]]) 06:41, 18 July 2011 (UTC)

== The events on Aug 16 and  the aftereffects ==

The events on/after Aug 16 was earlier under the subsection &quot;Arrest and aftermaths&quot; under the section Indefinite fast. Currently somebody has moved it to a special section under the name &quot;2nd Indian Freedom Struggle, 2011 - Freedom against corruption&quot; . 

* First of all this affects the continuity of the content. The events on Aug 16 should be under the indefinite fast section which is again under the Lokpal bill section. 

* The title &quot;2nd freedom struggle&quot; is not objective&quot;. It sounds rather like propaganda. 

So I suggest to revert to the earlier title and sectioning. Please comment.

Look, I cannot help you if you wish to ignore the facts available in these articles.  There is one article which quotes Hazare referring to an &quot;oath&quot; where men undergo vasectomies.  The rest include the words: &quot;forced&quot;, &quot;enforced&quot; and &quot;compulsory&quot;.  With regard to &quot;to cut them to size, the men in the village undergo vasectomy&quot; – Would you reasonably believe that 100% of the men voluntarily agree with vasectomy?

== Hunger Strike ==

I am confused about how the authorities can forbid or restrict a hunger strike.  Will they actually force feed Hazare?!  I assume they would not go that far.

Perhaps the answer lies in the statement (in the article), &quot;The conditions included restricting the length of the fast to three days and the number of protesters at the site to 5,000.&quot; In other words, they (presumably) can't control how long he actually fasts, but they are putting restrictions on the number of protesters, and then also on any public statement he will make to protesters about how long he intends to fast (or is fasting).

Do I have that right? [[User:Toddcs|Toddcs]] ([[User talk:Toddcs|talk]]) 23:37, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

== Explanation of &quot;beedies&quot; in brackets unnecessary? ==

In the &quot;Prohibition of Alcohol&quot; section, in the third paragraph, there are these lines:

''&quot;..was decided to ban the sale of tobacco, cigarettes, and beedies (an unfiltered cigarette where the tobacco is rolled in [[tendu]] also known as Diospyros melanoxylon leaves instead of paper) in the village&quot;''

A properly edited version of which would be&quot;

''&quot;..was decided to ban the sale of tobacco, cigarettes, and beedies (an unfiltered cigarette where the tobacco is rolled in [[tendu]] leaves (also known as [[Diospyros melanoxylon]]) instead of paper) in the village&quot;'''

But that has two sets of brackets, and doesn't look very good. So I'm wondering, is it really necessary to explain tendu when the link is already there, and people who want to know what it is cna just follow the link? The tendu link already leads to Diospyros melanoxylon, is there a need to explain so again in brackets?

About Anna Hazare the lines written by author are not proved. Please delete these line. I am from his village. there is no practice of flogging. Flogging is followed in rural India from past. Anna Hazare in fact educated people against superstitions. Rural people practiced several forms of superstitions to ward of addictions which sufferers could not control themselves. They themselves consented to flogging seeking for some solution. But Anna Hazare, tried his best to stop this flogging practice and encourage people to increase will power.

I checked the article from which the lines about flogging. There is no reference or proof. These lines may have been used to defame him. PLease remove it from your article unless someone prooves it.

Under the article &quot;arrest and Aftermath&quot; Please replace 

&quot;On 16 August 2011, Hazare was arrested four hours before the planned indefinite hunger strike.[91] Rajan Bhagat, spokesman for Delhi Police, said police arrested Hazare under a legal provision that bans public gatherings and protests at the park in Delhi where he was planning to begin his hunger strike. Police took that action after Hazare refused to meet the conditions put forward by police for allowing the protest.[92] The conditions included restricting the length of the fast to three days and the number of protesters at the site to 5,000.&quot; 

to &quot; In July, Anna Hazare's team India Against Corruption(IAC) writes letter to Delhi Police for indefinite fast at Jantar Mantar to oppose the bill presented in the Parliament. But due to insufficient information (like the venue cannot be handed over to an organization for an 'indefinite' period) provided by them and the limited space at Jantar Mantar, the request was turned down. then IAC requested for other venues on which fast can be conducted. Finally, Jai Prakash Narayan park (JP park) was offered by Police after imposing reasonable conditions. Of these 6 of the conditions were termed unacceptable by IAC team and refused to agree to the conditions. These 6 conditions include limiting the protest to three days and limiting the protesters to 5000 after considering the size of the park. Police said that as it is the time when Parliament is in session and many other groups come to protest the policies of govt. and JP park is in Central Delhi close to Parliament, it will not be possible to hand over the park for a long period. On 15th August, Delhi Police wrote a letter to Anna Hazare and said &quot;..you have refused to give an undertaking on all the points, as required by us. Therefore... the permission for fast/dharna at JPN Park cannot be accorded to you. You also do not have permission from the land-owning agency. Therefore, you are informed that any assembly by your organisation at that venue would be unlawful.&quot; Team IAC declared that they will not accept the conditions and conduct a mass gathering for a indefinite period at JP Park. Delhi Police decided to take a tough stand on this and imposed section 144 around JP park to prevent any mass gathering in the area. Under this provision, people cannot move in a group of more than 4 persons. Team IAC reacted to it and challenged to break the prohibitory orders. On 16th August, Hazare was detained under the provisions of  Sections 107/151 of the Cr.PC. It says that if the police is satisfied  that the person is likely to commit a cognisable offence, it has the powers to take preventive measures in apprehension of breach of peace.&quot; 

because the current paragraph actually provides incomplete information which can be misinterpreted.

Also replace &quot;Hazare ended his fast on 28 August 2011, after the Indian Government had passed the resolution for the Lokpal Bill unanimously,&quot; 

with 

&quot; On 20th August, Anna Hazare asked government to withdraw the Lokpal Bill which was sent to the Standing Committee for its consideration and introduce IAC's version into the Parliament. He made a declaration that government must pass the bill in the same format as it is directed by Anna Hazare or he will ask the masses for &quot;Jail Bharo Andolan&quot; i.e. to give court arrests to show the support for the bill. Later his team member Shanti Bhushan said that it is possible to pass a legislation in 6-7 days by short discussions within the Parliament and not sending it to Standing Committee which takes long time due to deep discusses of the bill and asking the views of all citizens. He also said that if Parliament decides some small changes to be done, it can be done only if Shri Anna Hazare permits those changes. Government refused to withdraw the bill from Standing Committee and promised team Anna that their recommendations will be given due consideration by the Standing Committee and also forwarded the Jan Lokpal Bill prepared by IAC for consideration of Standing Committee. But Shri Anna Hazare was firm on his ground and keep on demanding withdrawal of bill. After All- Party meeting and other rounds of meetings with IAC members, Hazare said that it will break his fast if Parliament start discussions on 3 major issues of the draft. These were

- This law should ensure that every state has a Lokayukta
- All government departments should have Citizens Charters to address the people's problems and any violation should be penalised.
- Every level of central and state government employees should come under the purview of Lokpal.  

Government with the help of other political parties and others decided to start discussions on all the provisions of Lokpal and all recommendations from various other sections along with with these three issues. After a long debate the house adopted &quot;Sense of the House&quot; to include these three provisions and decided to forward the discussion to Standing Committee for its consideration. Now Standing Committee will decide whether these 3 conditions can be adjusted into the law or not. &quot;

Under: Controversies and criticism &gt; Accusation of being anti-democratic and anti-dalit -- there is a quote from Kancha Ilaiah that uses a term that I think should be defined via a link. The term is ''manuvadi''; the quote: '''Dalit activist Kancha Ilaiah also commented in a similar fashion, that &quot;The Anna movement is an anti-social justice, manuvadi movement. The Dalits, tribals, OBCs and minorities have nothing to do with it. We oppose it.&quot;[132]'''

The term doesn't currently have a wikipedia page, but there is one for [[Manu_(Hinduism)|Manu]]; maybe an addition could be made to that page and the link could go to that? Or, an external link to this page: http://sacredgames.typepad.com/glossary/2006/08/manuvadi.html which at this moment is the first result for ''manuvadi'' in Google (and how I learned the definition). I cannot vouch for its accuracy, but I turned to Google when there was no link explanation for that term, and I imagine it'd be useful for other users too.

Can someone with permissions include this information in the introduction:

&quot;In the past, Hazare has fought against the use of tobacco and alchol, for literacy and against dowry and caste attitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13017897|publisher=BBC|author=Kalpana Sharma|date=7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 2003 Hazare fought for the enactment of the [[Right to Information]] act in the Maharashtra state government which gave in and enacted the RTI law on the 12th day of his 2003 fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13017897|publisher=BBC|author=Kalpana Sharma|date=7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

There is also a need to summarise the contents of &quot;Conspiracy to murder&quot; in 1 line in the introduction.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/59.95.13.253|59.95.13.253]] ([[User talk:59.95.13.253|talk]]) 00:35, 20 December 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;{{tld|edit request}}

:Not Done.  It's mentioned in the &quot;Transformation of Ralegan Siddhi&quot; section.  I don't know that conspiracy to murder needs to be stated in the introduction.  I think most public figures who've campaigned for good have had someone who's wanted to kill them at one time or another.  Also, there's a &quot;Conspiracy to murder Hazare&quot; section already. [[User:Banaticus|Banaticus]] ([[User talk:Banaticus|talk]]) 20:05, 5 January 2012 (UTC)

I strongly object. The cases of the dowry and caste attitudes that are referred to may make an interesting backdrop to the story as reported by Ms. Kalpana Sharma in the BBC, but are irrelevant in the course of discussion of how the contents of &quot;Conspiracy to Murder' relate to the incidents that occured in Ralegaon Siddhi after Hazare's arrival. The manner in which the Maharashtra government gave in to the RTI issue is also typical of the way in which the events unfolded and there can be no doubt that what the IP is requesting cannot be denied on such grounds. Kindly re consider. [[User:Theodorebalthazar|Theodorebalthazar]] ([[User talk:Theodorebalthazar|talk]]) 06:24, 8 January 2012 (UTC)

[[User:Death rider|Death rider]] ([[User talk:Death rider|talk]]) 13:29, 5 September 2016 (UTC) please let me edit this page 

i have the following info

Anna Hazare is one of India's well-acclaimed social activists. A former soldier in the Indian army, Anna is well known and respected for upgrading the ecology and economy of the village of Ralegan Siddhi which is located in the drought prone Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra state. The erstwhile barren village has metamorphosed into a unique model of rural development due to its effective water conservation methods, which made the villagers self-sufficient. Earlier, the same village witnessed alcoholism, utter poverty and migration to urban slums. Inspired by Hazareàµ®ique approach of salvaging a hopeless village, the state government has implemented the `Model Village?scheme as part of its official strategy. Hazare is now synonymous with rural development in India.
