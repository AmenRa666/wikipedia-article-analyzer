==Comment==
i'm considering getting a yupik audio language course.

i'm trying to learn everything i possibly can about the eskimos.

does anyone on here speak yupik?

For starters try the Alaska Native Language Center, http://www.uaf.edu/anlc

== Imarpik ==

Is it correct that Imarpik is the Yupik name of the Bering sea? See [[Talk:Bering Sea]]. --[[User:Amire80|Amir E. Aharoni]] ([[User talk:Amire80|talk]]) 21:52, 28 January 2008 (UTC)

== Why merged ??? ==

[[Eskimo]] peoples are [[Yupik peoples]] and [[Inuit peoples]].  The page '''[[Yupik people]]''' is mixed page! [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yup%27ik&amp;action=history This] is not true! The page '''[[Yup'ik]]''' for only [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language]] speaking people! But, the page '''[[Yupik]]''' for [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language]], [[Naukan Yupik language]], [[Siberian Yupik language]] and [[Alutiiq language]] speaking peoples: [[Siberian Yupik people]], [[Alutiiq people]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yup%27ik#Merge_with_Yupik Would you please look] The pages  '''[[Yup'ik]]''' (Central Alaskan Yup'ik language speaking people) and '''[[Yupik]]''' (Eskimo languages [excluded Inuit languages] speaking peoples). Not merged, not merged, not merged!!! --[[User:Kmoksy|Kmoksy]] ([[User talk:Kmoksy|talk]]) 23:13, 6 August 2011 (UTC)

:I've unmerged, and move the articles to more obvious names. (&quot;Yupik&quot; and &quot;Yup'ik&quot; were just too close.) I've tagged it for expert attention, since there may be [[WP:content fork]] issues. Kmoksy, depending on how comfortable you are editing English, you can either straighten this out yourself, or explain here what needs to be done so that each article covers its proper subject. — [[User:Kwamikagami|kwami]] ([[User talk:Kwamikagami|talk]]) 01:37, 7 August 2011 (UTC)

==Sorting this article out==
This article seems to move back and forth between discussing all Yupik peoples and then only the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people]]. Since the title is plural, it should probably be expanded and made to consistently cover all Yupik peoples. -[[User:Uyvsdi|Uyvsdi]] ([[User talk:Uyvsdi|talk]]) 17:04, 20 July 2012 (UTC)Uyvsdi

There is no reason why [[Yakama]] had to be fiddled with at all, because [[Yakima, Washington]] is spelled differently.

***You've opened four different discussions. Each response is for the particular discussion it appears in. You hadn't left any notice of a combined discussion area either, until your response to me. There's only the ''See notes on [[Talk:Chipewyan#Requested move]]'' indicating that the rationale can be found at the other page. People have left these kind of notes referencing already closed discussions before, so it is not an obvious conclusion that you want a unified discussion area at that location from this page's rationale. Nor is the discussion at [[Talk:Chipewyan]] pointing to which other discussions were opened to companion it as part of the 30-page limit, and which are not part of it, but merely use that discussion's points as the rationale. (IOW, the discussion are not highly linked, so leaving a separate point at each discussion will mean the closing admin will definitely see it, as the {{tl|discussion moved}} indication or similar has not been explicitly stated in the subsidiary nomination pages; nor even indicated at the &quot;prime&quot; discussion where the subsidiary nominations were located) Considering the fact that other users besides myself, have lodged opinions at several of your non-&quot;prime&quot; discussions, it's not very clear to several users that this is meant as a single discussion at a single location. -- [[Special:Contributions/70.50.151.11|70.50.151.11]] ([[User talk:70.50.151.11|talk]]) 15:21, 13 March 2014 (UTC)
::The limitations on bulk RMs I coped with as best I could; hundreds of articles are involved, 120 only so far have been posted, and all concern a central titling issue and what should be a convention.  And you know what?  You claim &quot;several&quot; discussions have been opened, but I've watchlisted every single item now, and do not see &quot;several&quot; but only the main one at [[Talk:Chipewyan people#Requested move]] and a brief one on [[Talk:Cayuga people#Requested move]]; and your two on Yupik and Yaquina. That's all.  So please stop exaggerating; I did post notices on the talkpage at WP:IPNA and at CANTALK and, yes, should have thought to be more explicit on the mention of the Chipewyan people talkpage about the other three groups of RMs and links to them, and to make you happy I will now.  But complaining that *I* didn't centralize discussion when you repeated yourself on four different pages with the same post - and now making a case for decentralized discussion, is hardly &quot;procedural&quot;.  Common sense would have told you, from the link to the rationale for the group on [[Talk:Chipewyan people]], that that would be the place for centralized discussion, but I forgot the common sense is in short supply around Wikipedia, especially on matters of procedure.  The procedure that is at question here is how it was that so many articles got changed without discussion, and if the RM process weren't limited by number in such cases....it seems you just want to pick this apart procedurally without actually considering the overall issue....about a group of RMs which need to be addressed collectively......applying separate guidelines to over a hundred similar-topic articles is not workable; especially when the convention/guideline used to change them doesn't even exist except in the claims of the perpetrator.[[User:Skookum1|Skookum1]] ([[User talk:Skookum1|talk]]) 16:21, 13 March 2014 (UTC)

::::Are you suggesting that [[Inuit]] should be disambiguated with &quot;people&quot;?  We have other kinds of &quot;Eskimos&quot; in Canada, e.g. the [[Inuvaliut]].

Not, as many Canadians already know, and I'm sure you do too, that 'Inuit&quot; is already a plural, as is &quot;Inuvaliut&quot;.  And re [[Inuit language]], a title created to replace [[Inuktitut]], this was done against MOSTCOMMON as &quot;Inuktitut&quot; has been an established and regular term within Canadian English for decades now.  I note also there is a category [[:Category:Eskimos]] which is of dubious utility given the derogatory sense of that name and exoynmic origin of that name as perceived by the Inuit et al. (at least in Canada) per the naming convention on indigenous peoples and tribes: ''&quot;&quot;How the group self-identifies should be considered.
