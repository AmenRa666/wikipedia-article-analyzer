The Chart of abuse of women / children;
In the chart of 2006, Sweden (among others) are marked black (as a country with (I guess) a significant number of women and childrend seeking refugee in USA claiming abuse in their 'black' homeland. I would very much like to see some documentation of this (as well as for the other European countries). I'm myself a Norwegian (Norway is marked white) and have never seen Sweden as an abusive country, contrary it is more a country of absolute political correctness! gunnar_hellem@hotmail.com
:''as a country with (I guess) a significant number of women and childrend seeking refugee in USA claiming abuse '' - No. It's a country from which the Center has had any clients. [[User:Raul654|Raul654]] 07:49, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
:Yeah there's no implication that Sweden is somehow abusive. I agree with you - it is a very nice country - but they have had some women from there come for help.[[User:UberCryxic|UberCryxic]] 13:03, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

== Inconsistent viewpoint? ==

From the article:
::''Tahirih helps women who are attempting to escape from such abuse as female genital cutting, domestic violence, human trafficking, torture and rape.''
It has seemed, over time, that the consensus of editors at [[Female genital cutting]] is to prefer that article title over such suggested alternatives as ''Female Circumcision'' or ''Female Genital Mutilation''.  One of the reasons for this is the position, forwarded on FGC's talk page by some who support the FGC title, that it is a POV to portray FGC as abuse (ie., some insist that FGC is not ''necessarily'' abuse).  Yet this article outright and openly describes FGC as &quot;abuse&quot; (along with a number of other activities about whose abusive nature there is no dispute).  
It seems that the editors of the two article have differing views on whether the procedure qualifies as abuse.  What is the best solution to overcoming this mismatch in viewpoint?  Cheers, [[User:Kasreyn|Kasreyn]] 22:06, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
:Of the 5 places where &quot;Female genital cutting&quot; is used (and alluded to abuse), most state it as the organization's belief:
:#In the lead: &quot;''Tahirih helps women who are attempting to escape from such abuse as female genital cutting'' : in this case it is not stated as Tahirih's belief, but if women are attempting to escape, they would probably think it's abuse.
:#In the section on &quot;Beginning: &quot;''Fauziya Kassindja was a Togolese teenager who fled her native land in 1994 to escape from a forced polygamous marriage and a tribal practice of female genital cutting.''&quot;  This is a factual statement.
:#In the section on &quot;Growth&quot;: &quot;''According to the United Nations, two million women undergo female genital cutting in Africa every year.''&quot;: This a factual statement, but the previous sentence uses the word abuse, so it could be changed to state &quot;claimed abuse&quot; or something like that.
:#Section on &quot;Female Genital Cutting&quot;: Section clearly indicates that it is the organization's belief.
:#Section on &quot;Criticism and response&quot;: The section again places it as Tahirih's belief. (&quot;''Tahirih posits''&quot;).
:So I don't see much of a problem. -- [[User:Jeff3000|Jeff3000]] 22:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

== Forced Marriage Initiative ==

I wish the article mentions the [http://www.tahirih.org/advocacy/policy-areas/forced-marriage-initiative/ Forced Marriage Initiative], just so any American that happens to come across this article could hear about [[forced marriage]] in increased chances. --[[User:Lo Ximiendo|Lo Ximiendo]] ([[User talk:Lo Ximiendo|talk]]) 08:49, 23 December 2012 (UTC)

== Featured article review ==

There appears to be a consensus at [[WP:NPOVN]] (permanent link [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/Noticeboard&amp;oldid=626704565#Tahirih_Justice_Center here]) that in this article's current state it does not deserve the [[WP:FA|Featured Article]] designation. The main concerns are a pro-subject [[WP:NPV|bias]] and an over-reliance on [[WP:PRIMARY|primary sources]] [[WP:ABOUTSELF|affiliated with the subject]]. Participation is invited to fix these issues before the article gets [[WP:FAR|reviewed for delisting]]. --[[User:DrFleischman|Dr. Fleischman]] ([[User talk:DrFleischman|talk]]) 21:20, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
:Based on comments at NPOVN, I've:
:*Removed the entire &quot;Growth&quot; section as parts of it being based entirely on primary sources, and parts of it being [[WP:SYNTH]]
:*Removed the entire &quot;Fundraising&quot; section that was based on primary sources only.
:I've left the tags concerning the whole article in place because it still relies extensively on primary sources (even the book ''Do They Hear You When You Cry'' is co-authored by the founder). I am not sure about notability; there seem to be periodic news items about this organization. They just aren't used in this article, although they should be. Notability could be determined by an AfD discussion (I would participate). If this article will be discussed in FAR, I would support delisting it as a Featured article.
