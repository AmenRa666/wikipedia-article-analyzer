==Untitled==
The discography section is confusing - the &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; and &quot;Universal&quot; sections seem to overlap each other chronologically. It is also not noted when the band changed labels and under what circumstances. --[[User:Jeffthejiff|jeffthejiff]] 18:55, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Updated and expanded the article hopefully resolving the issue about change of record labels. --[[User:Cavie78]] 11:00, 27 Oct 2005



So, my guess is that this band is known as &quot;Charlatans U.K.&quot; because of the 1960s group known as &quot;The Charlatans&quot;; it'd be good to have more about that. [[User:JD79|JD79]] 03:01, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

:(From The Charlatans Authorized History): Apparently the maganer for the Charlatans (UK), [[Steve Harrison]], was pretty &quot;pissed off&quot; about this old band, being as they had broken up before Burgess ''et al''. &quot;were even toilet trained&quot;. Harisson is supposed to have remarked, that if they aren't working on anything then &quot;they were nothing&quot;. [[User:CJ DUB|CJ DUB]] 01:56, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

The original line-up, that supported The Stone Roses at Spike Island, actually didn't include Baker. Baz Ketley was the singer and guitarist. After Ketley quit the band, and Tim Burgess took over on vocals, Baker was then brought in to cover guitar. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jonnycigarettes|Jonnycigarettes]] ([[User talk:Jonnycigarettes|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jonnycigarettes|contribs]])  as of 22:53, 22 July 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;


=== Tony Rogers ===

Removed this from the article 'cos it didn't fit but if anyone wants to slightly rewrite the section on Rogers joining to get it in here it is:

previously toured with a band called job (pronounced jobe) releasing an acclaimed album called ROSARYBEADS'N'ICECREAM with brother Don Rogers

=== Tim Burgess ===
Why does it say Tim Burgess (Northwich) on here but on the Tim Burgess Wikipedia page it says he's from Salford? He sounds like he's from Salford or Manchester.  -- &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:195.224.113.189|195.224.113.189]] ([[User talk:195.224.113.189|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/195.224.113.189|contribs]])  at 09:58, 26 February 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:He's definitely from Northwich, we went to the same high school![[User:Yellowxander|Yellowxander]] ([[User talk:Yellowxander|talk]]) 20:50, 28 May 2013 (UTC)

===Sanctuary===

It refers to new label Sanctuary - but they only released one album and a compilation. What happened ? -- [[User:Beardo|Beardo]] ([[User talk:Beardo|talk]]) 18:58, 22 March 2008 (UTC)

This section refers to the fact that the album was produced by Jim Lowe and links to an article on a Jim Lowe. I have doubts that this is the correct Jim Lowe as I personally was a signed artist with Sanctuary Records and we used a London based engineer called Jim Lowe, a Google search suggests he has graduated to production since the days I worked with him. I suspect that is the same Jim Lowe as used by The Charlatans and not the one linked to in the article.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Drinky|Drinky]] ([[User talk:Drinky|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Drinky|contribs]]) 02:30, 6 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Marque or Marquee ==

It refers to the New York [[Marque]] which link is not relevant. Does it actually mean the [[Marquee]] club - though again, we have no article. -- [[User:Beardo|Beardo]] ([[User talk:Beardo|talk]]) 19:49, 22 March 2008 (UTC)

==Charlatans singles==
I've notice that The Charlatans singles all have articles, with the exception of Crashin' In, which redirects to the self titled album. Most of the articles are tiny stubs with no information at all. The most surprising thing is that some of the empty articles are singles from The Charlatans more successful &quot;Height of Britpop&quot; era. I'm not The Charlatans biggest fan but i would like to see someone, who is a keen contributor or a follower to expand these articles to give the information they deserve, after all they were one of the greatest bands of the 90's.[[User:PhilOak|PhilOak]] ([[User talk:PhilOak|talk]]) 05:39, 22 November 2009 (UTC)

==Jon Brookes==
Word spreading that drummer Jon Brookes has died. Any confirmation?[[User:AuntFlo|AuntFlo]] ([[User talk:AuntFlo|talk]]) 10:09, 13 August 2013 (UTC)
:Confirmed [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23682282] --[[User:Racklever|Racklever]] ([[User talk:Racklever|talk]]) 10:40, 13 August 2013 (UTC)

== Jim Spencer and Craig Silvey ==

The links to Wiki pages for this pair go to unrelated pages. As far as I can tell, the Jim Spencer and Craig Silvey referred to here have no articles on Wikipedia. 

Would it be OK if I delink their names so it's just plain text?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Prak Mann|Prak Mann]] ([[User talk:Prak Mann|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Prak Mann|contribs]]) 21:23, 17 May 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
