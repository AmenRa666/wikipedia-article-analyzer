==87 Million Copies?!==
Breakaway cannot have sold 87 million copies worldwide! Isn't it 8.7? Sources, please...  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/83.254.117.37|83.254.117.37]] ([[User talk:83.254.117.37|talk]]) 20:30, 10 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Digital Restrictions Management?==
Some CD's put anti-copying software at the edge. On this CD, data is clearly written on the CD's edge, and the songs are separated by small circles of unused space. Is this due to [[Digital Restrictions Management|DRM]]? Can the band of written data on the very edge of the CD be deactivated by going over it with a Sharpie? [[User:SteveSims|SteveSims]] 19:44, 27 June 2007 (UTC)

== Contradiction ==

Quote: &quot;In Canada, the song was also extremely popular, peaking at number three.&quot;
Quote: &quot;...with the song Breakaway which has not been released outside of Australia and the US.&quot;

Someone needs to fix this. [[User:MorwenofLossarnarch|MorwenofLossarnarch]] 21:57, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

I don't know...but songs are rarely released in just the U.S. without Canada, right?

[[User:68.229.164.101|68.229.164.101]] 13:08, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:Songs are almost always released in North America, which, in this case, means just Canada and the U.S.[[User:Adamsmo|Adamsmo]] 02:12, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

== Another contradiction ==

In the Addicted article, it says that it's ''rumored'' to be the next single, and the actual Clarkson article also states this. But also Clarkson's box in her article with her singles includes Addicted with them, and this says that Addicted has been ''confirmed'' to be her next single. Please, someone help us? [[User:MorwenofLossarnarch|MorwenofLossarnarch]] 00:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:Addicted was a double A-side single with Breakaway in the U.K.  But that's all, and Breakaway was the only one that charted.[[User:Adamsmo|Adamsmo]] 02:12, 19 May 2007 (UTC)

== Yet Another Contradiction ==
&quot;Addicted&quot; '''Not yet confirmed''', &quot;Addicted&quot; is supposed to be Clarkson's sixth single from the album. It was supposed to be the fifth single, but was rejected because of being to similar to her last to songs &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot; and &quot;Because of You&quot;. '''But, it is now certain that Addicted will be the sixth and final single from the album.''' [[User:Tombadevil|Tomba]] 00:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Billboard Charts==
Breakaway is the 10th best selling album of 2006 &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/71.225.206.193|71.225.206.193]] ([[User talk:71.225.206.193|talk]]) 20:54, 8 February 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

All this excessive information about the albums commercial performance makes for a particularly dull read while basic facts aren't mentioned at all. Who played on the album, y'know, musicians? 10 producers are named but only one performer. And which studio was it recorded in? How long did it take? etc

== Album cover ==

The covers of the first release and the re-release with DVD are different. So please don't remove the old cover &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Freddyfu123|Freddyfu123]] ([[User talk:Freddyfu123|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Freddyfu123|contribs]]) 16:21, 5 May 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

==Fair use rationale for Image:Breakway-uk.jpg==
[[Image:Nuvola apps important.svg|70px|left]]
'''[[:Image:Breakway-uk.jpg]]''' is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in '''this''' Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Breakway-uk.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is  other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation can be deleted one week after being tagged, as described on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#Images.2FMedia|criteria for speedy deletion]].

==87 million copies?==
In this article says something like this ... &quot;The album has as of 2008 sold over 87 million copies worldwide and is the most successful &quot;Idol&quot; alumn album to date.&quot; It's way too much. This would mean that this album outsold Come On Over ([[Shania Twain]]) by over 1 to 2. And also the reference is not helping either. Something has to be done.[[Special:Contributions/78.97.4.178|78.97.4.178]] ([[User talk:78.97.4.178|talk]]) 13:51, 10 March 2009 (UTC)
