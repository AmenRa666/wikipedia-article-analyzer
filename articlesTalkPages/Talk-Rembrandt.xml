== Listing External Link ==

I would like to add our company link to your Rembrandt External Links. 

We represent the complete collection of Rembrandt etchings by Amand-Durand, featuring Rembrandt's self portraits, landscapes, biblical scenes and other portraiture. Our website is www.rembrandtart.com.


Thank You, www.rembrandtart.com

Why is the article located at [http://www.anthonychristian.co.uk/ezine14.html www.anthonychristian.co.uk/ezine14.html] not relevant enough to be included in the external links?  

It is written by a very well known art-historian and makes the interesting point that Rembrandt did, in fact, use impressionist techniques 400 years before the impressionist movement.

== 4 or 5 pictures per row + new additions  ==
[[File:51001.jpg|thumb|'' Young Girl at the Window'', Hendrickje, 1651 REMOVED]]
As it is now with 4 pictures per row + additions we have a gallery that has 12 rows + the drawings,= that makes it '''15 rows'''! - and  that is an '''enormous''' gallery. Before, with 5  pictures per row  we had a gallery that was 6 rows + the drawings. I strongly oppose these changes, they are not an improvment. 

I like pictures and galleries but one has to make a selection, and this supposed to be a good article. 12 rows plus the drawings it is just a big, giant, and even more unselected gallery as it was before, with a lot of pictures that are NOT famous or representative for Rembrandt. Themes are repeating themselves, a good deal of the new pictures are unsignificant works, their visibility is extra bad due to the small size and the dark quality of Rembrandts works.  When we were talking about the gallery, above,  were talkig removing a few '''more pictures''', not adding some new   pictures.  If not getting any response, (as usual) start an Rcf, soon.

:Agree; I've trimmed 3 rows I think. How over 4 per row works on smaller screens etc I'm not sure. Otherwise I'm in favour. [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 14:18, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
::That looks fine...[[User:Modernist|Modernist]] ([[User talk:Modernist|talk]]) 14:21, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
If we take 3 per row, we will have even more rows, it will be long-long and small. We must select the pictures that are representative and look good in the gallery. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 14:24, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
:Aside from the fact that I added a few very important paintings including his first painting - Rembrandt is one of the most important painters in European art history - get off it...Try reading this:[[WP:OWN]]...[[User:Modernist|Modernist]] ([[User talk:Modernist|talk]]) 14:31, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
::Now, now, exacly when I thought we were having a civilized discussion here.  Hendrickje, that was his second - woman, we can't remove her. And his first picture it doesn't look much in the gallery, it probably looks better in the article, if we have to have that one. Try reading  [[WP:OWN]] yourself, it is you who take things personally. And [[WP:POLITE]] too.  I don't care about ownership, I care about quality. I  know very well that Rembrandt is one of the most important painters in European art history, that is why we have to make it good. I read enought art history to know that. As long as the changes are for the better, fine. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 14:34, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
:::Make a section of early paintings and since the first painting also includes a self-portrait; write that up as well; and remove it from the gallery. I think the article is fine right now...[[User:Modernist|Modernist]] ([[User talk:Modernist|talk]]) 14:39, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
::Well, for example, that is a good idea. [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 14:42, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
:::Try it...[[User:Modernist|Modernist]] ([[User talk:Modernist|talk]]) 14:43, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
..No, I will NOT. I know quite a lot about art history and I am an academic but English is not my first language. I can write that kind of things in Swedish, but in English, that will not work well - '''but''' that doesn't mean that I am not good at arts, because I am. And some of the Rembrand that I added were pictures  which, while not particularly well known, were none the less wonderful examples of Rembrandt's art. This kind of things I can judge. &lt;sup&gt;And I probably can write better in English than you in Swedish.&lt;/sup&gt; [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 14:51, 13 July 2014 (UTC)

&lt;/gallery&gt;
One has to think over certain paintings placement, shall it be in the gallery, or not. Shall it be in the article or create a single row of a  possible bigger gallery? As someone said: putting together galleries that look good takes a lot of work. Jamming together every picture  after a timeline is not always best.  You need to choose high quality images that sit well together and  you need to arrange them as if you were hanging works in a real gallery. - [[User:Hafspajen|Hafspajen]] ([[User talk:Hafspajen|talk]]) 15:15, 13 July 2014 (UTC)

::OK; hope I explained how I was thinking, and sorry if i was a bit sharp, but it is not so nice to hear ''one of the most important painters in European art history - get off it.'' - I am good at art articles in my own way, and can help.

==Selection==
I am not entirely satisfied with our selection of his works. We say: '''''Having achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high ... Rembrandt's greatest creative triumphs are exemplified especially in his portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible.''''' Well, selfportraits we have to many of in the gallery  really, but we removed portraits lately. We should have more portraits, more organized after themes and not entirely  timeline, more - of the great works he had, genre painting, portraits, and so on. 

Just as Nabokov had no use for social, moral or political advocacy in art, he was equally disinterested in classifying art by themes or generalities, looking instead into the details of a work of art in order to extract its essence.

Hello fellow Wikipedians,
