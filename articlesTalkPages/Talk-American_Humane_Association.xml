== Article corruption ==

The article got corrupted by a person removing the controvery section: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Humane_Association&amp;oldid=649694700#Controversy
This section has to put back in the article.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/84.119.188.147|84.119.188.147]] ([[User talk:84.119.188.147|talk]]) 01:28, 22 November 2015 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Controversy==
&quot;Increased protection from unwarranted controversies.&quot;  
Seems like this should be in a separate controversy section. It doesn't seem like a role of the organization to stop controversy or decide that it is unwarranted. There has been a lot of controversy about AHA and if they really protect animals used in films. I'll research and document some, then post here for review.

*I have removed and replaced this whole paragraph as the website no longer exists and a well-intentioned but misguided user, LA Animal Lover, had added unsubstantiated criticism of the AHA over the Flicka deaths (as they had done to the [[Flicka]] article). There still seems to be controversy as the AHA claim the deaths were unpreventable but the LA ASD report contradicts this (at least in one case).

== New organization name? ==

This organization seems to have changed its name to &quot;American Humane&quot; (without &quot;Association&quot;). Is this correct? [[User:Badagnani|Badagnani]] ([[User talk:Badagnani|talk]]) 04:28, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

:I don't think we should change it until they announce that they have changed it. At the moment, they are a bit schitzo about using both names. On their About Us page [http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/], they start out at AHA and end up as AH; although their home page is AH. If any change is called for, it might be to add &quot;American Humane Assocaition, '''also known as American Humane'''....&quot; [[User:Bob98133|Bob98133]] ([[User talk:Bob98133|talk]]) 16:31, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

I am with the organization and we definitely have NOT changed our name. Sometimes people will shorten it to American Humane when typing it or saying it, but the full name is American Humane Association. [[User:AHA1877|AHA1877]] ([[User talk:AHA1877|talk]]) 13:17, 1 March 2012 (UTC)

:Every movie I see uses the acronym AHAD, including on that copyrighted tagline.  Yet nary a PEEP in this article!

:What's the &quot;D&quot; stand for?  I'm stunned at how difficult it is to google this up. [[Special:Contributions/209.172.25.45|209.172.25.45]] ([[User talk:209.172.25.45|talk]]) 09:00, 12 May 2013 (UTC)

==Notes==
In the spirit of full disclosure, this page was updated on February 29, 2012 by myself, a current staffer at American Humane Association. I went to great lengths to edit the content that was provided for upload from a neutral perspective. Our intention was to better clarify what American Humane Association does and to clear up some confusion that might exist about our programs or between us and other similar non profit organizations - not to promote ourselves. Any &quot;fluff&quot; that may be present is unintended. We welcome further contributions and clarifications where &quot;fluff&quot; is present - and are amenable to removing said content. [[User:AHA1877|AHA1877]] ([[User talk:AHA1877|talk]])

== Dating ==

In the beginning of the article it says that &quot;In November and ''December'' of 2013, the Hollywood Reporter ''ran'' a major feature &lt;snip&gt;&quot;. Seeing as it isn't December yet, can a clarification be made? Possible options:

* Wrong year

* Wrong month

* Writing style made to appear to refer to past events as not to require editing later on

* Time travel

* Prank

So, which one would that be?

P.S. I sense a [[WP:COI|conflict of interest]] regarding the above section, since representatives of an organisation / people being referred to / etc are normally discouraged from editing related articles due to possibility of introducing an unintended bias.

== History ==

I think the history section should be shortened a bit. I think there is a bit more information than necessary, and a lot of the information on which states attended what conference in the 1800's is a bit redundant. Does anyone have a source for a more concise summary of AHA's founding?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Animalluvr99|Animalluvr99]] ([[User talk:Animalluvr99|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Animalluvr99|contribs]]) 22:18, 2 March 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
