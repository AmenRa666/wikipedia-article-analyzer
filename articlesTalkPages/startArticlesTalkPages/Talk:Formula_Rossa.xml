==Layout==
Maybe we could add a section about the layout of the ride. [[User:Theguywhohatestwitter|Theguywhohatestwitter]] ([[User talk:Theguywhohatestwitter|talk]]) 00:23, 26 October 2009 (UTC)

==Infobox==
Maybe there should be an infobox about details on the ride. Since details are scarce, I'm not sure about making one. Should we? [[User:Theguywhohatestwitter|Theguywhohatestwitter]] ([[User talk:Theguywhohatestwitter|talk]]) 00:23, 26 October 2009 (UTC)

== Safety goggles not required ==

When I was there on December 31st 2010, only the two passengers in the front seats were required to wear goggles. The rest of us were not even offered. [[User:Velle|Velle]] ([[User talk:Velle|talk]]) 15:46, 4 January 2011 (UTC)

:I noticed that it was only the front 2 in some of the reverse POVs released. I have fixed it now. Seen as you have been on the ride maybe you could please add some information about the queue, station, ride experience etc to help expand the article away from being a stub. Thanks &lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #0072BC;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Themeparkgc|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0072BC;padding-left:1px;&quot;&gt;Themeparkgc&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Themeparkgc|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff;background:#0072BC;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:11, 5 January 2011 (UTC)

I was there on the end of October 2011, and everyone has to wear goggles.

They have heaps of glasses for the formula rossa. After the ride, you have to give back the goggles!

Can someone chance it, or wait for better evidence?!?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/49.183.229.194|49.183.229.194]] ([[User talk:49.183.229.194|talk]]) 11:02, 19 February 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Correct length and units policy in infobox ==

http://www.rcdb.com/m/4485.htm states 2000m (fan page),

http://www.intaminworldwide.com/amusement/Home/news/FormulaRossa/tabid/150/language/en-US/Default.aspx states 2.2 km (manufacturer),

http://www.ferrariworldabudhabi.com/en-gb/attractions/formula-rossa.aspx states 2.07 km (operator),

http://www.ferrari.com/English/about_ferrari/Theme-Park/Pages/100506_Formula_Rossa.aspx/ also states 2.07 km (brand owner)

The 2000m from rcdb and therefrom derived 6,561 ft in the infobox seem to be the most unofficial, but there's still a contradiction between manufacturer and operator.

The problem with the feet value is that it suggests false precision, as no source provides any customary units, even the 2.07 km only offer a quantification of 10m. According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Which_units_to_use , metric units should be applied here, but the roller coaster infobox template uses customary units.

Is there any policy about units for templates that are applied to areas with different measurement units? [[User:Makrom|Makrom]] ([[User talk:Makrom|talk]]) 00:49, 1 August 2011 (UTC)

:I've reimplemented the infobox using metric units. If you have a look at the [[Template:Infobox roller coaster#Usage|documentation for the roller coaster infobox]] you will see that it supports both types of units. I've utilised the statistics from the [http://www.intaminworldwide.com/amusement/Home/news/FormulaRossa/tabid/150/language/en-US/Default.aspx manufacturer's website]. I feel these would be the most correct as the manufacturer is the one that actually built the ride and would have access to the exact specifics. I think RCDB may have got the statistics when Ferrari World released them in a press release before the park opened and has left them like that. The two Ferrari sites would have had their information coming from the same place (possibly the request to build the coaster and/or the original plans measured the track as 2.07km). Kind regards &lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #0072BC;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Themeparkgc|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0072BC;padding-left:1px;&quot;&gt;Themeparkgc&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Themeparkgc|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff;background:#0072BC;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 06:19, 1 August 2011 (UTC)

::I think your argument for the manufacturer specs is valid. Also I didn't look close enough at the template options, this should clear the metric issue. In fact, isn't that a precedence for all the other coasters outside the U.S.? Furthermore, there's still the issue of false precision, this would be solved by implementing length_km and length_mi, but I don't think that's high priority. I've sent Intamin a mail, asking whether they are confident about their statement. [[User:Makrom|Makrom]] ([[User talk:Makrom|talk]]) 13:53, 1 August 2011 (UTC)
:::According to the email answer, signed by Intamin Amusement Rides Int. Corp. Est, the track length is 2120 meters. But can this be used as a source? [[User:Makrom|Makrom]] ([[User talk:Makrom|talk]]) 00:31, 2 August 2011 (UTC)

::::Unfortunately I don't think that could really be used as a source. Interesting, none the less. If you wish to discuss changes to the roller coaster infobox please feel free to add a new section to [[Template talk:Infobox roller coaster|its talk page]]. &lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid #0072BC;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:Themeparkgc|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0072BC;padding-left:1px;&quot;&gt;Themeparkgc&lt;/span&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;[[User_talk:Themeparkgc|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#fff;background:#0072BC;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Talk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:47, 2 August 2011 (UTC)

== Maximum acceleration G-Force: 1.7Gs ==

In the Ferrari world site it only states that &quot;You’ll accelerate up to 240km/h and see what 4.8 Gs really feels like.&quot;  However, they only ever state that the G load is 1.7 anywhere else.  Wouldn't expect the rest of the track to be that hard, as its at a much slower speed.  If anyone can verify 4.8 Gs, change it back, but I don't think the average person can just pop into a roller coaster and do that without passing out/vomiting.

== formula ross ==

it is a awesome coaster to ride but it is scary so i suggest that the younger people out thre should not go on it until they get older  &lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/50.250.35.141|50.250.35.141]] ([[User talk:50.250.35.141#top|talk]]) 15:06, 21 September 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>
