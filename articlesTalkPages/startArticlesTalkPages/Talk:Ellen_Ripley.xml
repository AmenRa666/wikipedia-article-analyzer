== Corrections ==

The year the Ripley was born in and the year that ''Alien'' takes place in were given in Ripley's biography and the Nostromo Flight Plan, both of which are available on the Alien DVD, which means they probably are canon. I've also removed the mention of Ripley's daughter dying of cancer. In the movie Burke never said what the cause of death was. The line about her dying of cancer is from the script. &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/218.214.143.84|218.214.143.84]] ([[User talk:218.214.143.84|talk]]) 12:45, 16 September 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt;

:Another thing, Clemens mentioning that there hasn't been a case of cholera in 200 is probably a mistake on the part of the script writers of Alien 3.

::::::::::::Nope, I'm right, Ripley the character isn't Ripley the clone. Not at all. Wikipedia may be many things but innaccurate, no. Ripley the clone is a device made up over a decade after Ripley the warrant officer who escaped the alien. 1979. &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Chandranova|Chandranova]] ([[User talk:Chandranova|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Chandranova|contribs]]) 22:07, 22 March 2007 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

←It's about the article pages. Currently, There is an Ellen Ripley article, and a separate article on her clone. See the tag at the top of the article mainspace. The merger is about moving the Clone article to this article. Your &quot;system of thinking&quot; would mean that we should separate Luke Skywalker the moisture farmer from his Jedi Knight counterpart. Technically they are two different points in the character's history. The Clone is not a &quot;new&quot; character, it's a spin from the original character, and thus it's information should be on this page.

== Ten Months? ==

In the first film, it was remarked that it would take ten months to get back to Earth; however, from the dialogue, the one who spoke mentioned the slowdown time and getting into orbit (I can't remember the quote verbatim). This seems to imply that they would have gotten to Earth sooner had they not stopped and taken the time to (apparently) decelerate, then accelerate again.

:Seems like common sense. If you stop traveling, set the ship down on a planetoid, and have a little adventure, naturally it's going to take you longer to get home than if you hadn't stopped at all. --[[User:IllaZilla|IllaZilla]] ([[User talk:IllaZilla|talk]]) 05:09, 6 December 2009 (UTC)

::Not what the Original Poster intended. I think they were comparing fictional space speeds. Aliens tends to use an older more &quot;Einstein-ian&quot; view of space travel, similar to the Slowerthanlight website. As such, the ship has mass which needs to be accelerated up and down (in space) before travel between stars. THUS: It took Ripley 57 years to reach Earth because her ship and life pod were not &quot;at speed&quot; as the ship was before they responded to the distress call. The Nostromo had to have had powerful engines to get to speed, and most of the ship must have been fuel storage, which is the only explanation (beyond just plain looking cool on camera) for the size of the ships in the Alien movies and the tiny crews  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/75.43.18.19|75.43.18.19]] ([[User talk:75.43.18.19|talk]]) 18:52, 6 November 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

&quot;Ripley has been selected as the eighth-greatest hero in American cinema history by the American Film Institute, as the fifth-coolest hero in pop culture by Entertainment Weekly,[2] the ninth-greatest movie character ever by Empire (the highest-placing female of the list), and the eighth-best movie character of all time by Premiere,[3] In 2011, John Scalzi called her &quot;Clearly the Best Female Character in Scifi Film&quot;.&quot;</text>
