The Australian review cites this review as moderate in quality, and possibly the only review that dealt with studies before 2008 a more comprehensive view. With a change in wording I see no reason to not add this review.

Who is edit warring who? Seems disingenuous to cite me for edit warring when I made a change and was reverted. I cited the review conclusions specific to the technique, that's how we best serve science, the review, and the encyclopedia.

::LittleOliveOil we negotiated the heck out of this above - a long and unpleasant negotiation - but we finally reached a point where everyone was happy enough and not too unhappy.  Unilaterally reopening that, especially with no prior discussion, is a prime example of [[WP:TENDENTIOUS]] editing and is just disruptive.  If - and I hope you think long and hard about it - you ''really'' want to re-open this negotiation again, please start a discussion here, taking into account the work we already did.

:::We did not discuss this section and the specific wording which reflects the conclusions reviewers reached on the technique. We were discussing the lead.

:::What I said is that the technique is a long-used technique in theater and that the research is less dominant than is AT use in a practical setting in theater ( summarizing myself). I am working on an article as a whole , so in that light, whatever my views are I am attempting to deal with the research in a forthright and accurate way. The information I added was specific and very specific to the reviewers own words. The words edit warred  in place were  not and were as far as I can see sourced to a blog. Jytdog do not threaten me,  and do not mischaracterize my actions or try to make them what they are not. You reverted a good faith edit as did Alexbrn. As I said above but I'll repeat it, I have no interest in a discussion in which my actions are mischaracterized, and where there is tag teaming. What is tendentious are the efforts to mischaracterize this technique, one that is so mainstream in the theater world as to be blatantly obvious to anyone who has any kind of experience in theater /dance. I understand some editors here do not have this kind of experience, but what is not acceptable is to paint pictures that are false both of the topic area and the editors editing here.([[User:Littleolive oil|Littleolive oil]] ([[User talk:Littleolive oil|talk]]) 18:55, 9 September 2016 (UTC))

::::I'd add. I have no interest in this technique's health benefits outside of the  posture that is necessary for healthy and effective movement in a performance format. I had no interest in the research, did not even know there was any, and had no idea the technique was being touted for its other health benefits. Its use, lets call it clinical, is clear. So no I didn't come to this article trying to skew the research as is implied by some editors and Jytdog above, and could care less personally; it doesn't impact me in a personal way. However, the bias exhibited here in terms of wanting to make sure the technique is characterized as a pseudoscience when its not a science, its a movement technique, and when it looks like there is legitimate research connected to the technique is mind boggling. I can only wonder with real amazement as to how a movement technique has come under the thumb of  the pseudoscience fighters.([[User:Littleolive oil|Littleolive oil]] ([[User talk:Littleolive oil|talk]]) 19:24, 9 September 2016 (UTC))
:::::Is it a pseudoscience? Awaiting comment in the thread above! [[User:Alexbrn|Alexbrn]] ([[User talk:Alexbrn|talk]]) 19:35, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::No interest in getting into a discussion when editors start mischaracterizing. I've said what I have to say, but I will ask you a question. Is an apple pseudoscience or is it that there is a possibility that research on that apple, just a fruit and a food, could be pseudoscientific? Science is the tool and the servant not the master. I was shocked to hear a physician here say medicine is science. I find that broad brush  approach surprising. Medicine, I hope, is a healing modality; its servant along with the physician is science.  Pseudoscience theories according to Wikipedia,  &quot;...characteristically fail to adhere to scientific standards and methods.&quot; Few people eating apples or teaching a movement technique as is taught all over the world with AT are carrying on scientific research. As with apple eating there may be good research on AT and there may be research which does not comply with scientific standards and methods. Pseudoscience is possible with both. Neither the apple nor the AT technique are pseudoscientific in and of themselves, and the while science behind eating the apple serves the apple and its benefits, the apple is not in and of itself science. Since you and others have allowed reviews on the study of the AT into this article I have to assume that per our RS you consider these reviews to be science not pseudoscience. Perhaps you have discarded other research as not compliant with good scientific standards-pseudoscience.([[User:Littleolive oil|Littleolive oil]] ([[User talk:Littleolive oil|talk]]) 22:10, 9 September 2016 (UTC))

:::::::::In my view AT is notable for its use by people in the performing arts to help them be more aware of their bodies so they can perform better.  The claims about &quot;health benefits&quot; are fringey and are not a big deal overall, and are appropriately WEIGHTed in the article.   The fuss over the lack of evidence that it is good for much healthwise (treating any actual disease or condition) is hard for me to understand.  This is not like acupuncture or something. [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] ([[User talk:Jytdog|talk]]) 22:44, 9 September 2016 (UTC)
::::::::::Yes and its notable because of its world wide use not because of the research on it. I agree. I wouldn't expect to find health benefits from what is basically a posture technique beyond the kinds of effects good posture and good balance bring. Fringe  may be a better word to describe its research at this point in time.([[User:Littleolive oil|Littleolive oil]] ([[User talk:Littleolive oil|talk]]) 23:00, 9 September 2016 (UTC))

You have to stop insisting the section and content was discussed; it wasn't. The lead was discussed; this content was not. Furthermore, mischaracterizing what an editor says and does as you did with me is the worst kind of personal attack. And you did personalize this conversation above when you said to Montana, &quot;If you are not interested in stirring up old stuff, then this conversation would not have been restarted for the second time, by you.&quot;  Deal with the edit and the legitimate question of why wording for the conclusion which accurately summarizes the conclusions in the review   has been superseded by another version which is further from the wording of the review and possibly OR.

:::We are not &quot;renegotiating&quot; anything.

In a normal situation, this would be a small wikignoming edit.  I believe that within the article space, [[WP:POINT]] is applicable.

:::::No discussion of motives.  You were explicit in wanting to re-open discussion about this section, which we did beat to death not long ago.  You wanted to renegotiate it.  So here we are. [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] ([[User talk:Jytdog|talk]]) 23:23, 19 September 2016 (UTC)

== Update done ==

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_technique&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=740097580&amp;oldid=739891828 in this dif].  I used quotes extensively since we seem unable to agree on paraphrasing.  This approach usually resolves differences on that front.

:Pretty sad that this was necessary. [[User:Alexbrn|Alexbrn]] ([[User talk:Alexbrn|talk]]) 05:59, 19 September 2016 (UTC)
::This change, at least, reflects the source accurately which is what I was requesting. While there may be an overabundance of quoted text at least we now have accuracy. I am fine with this change.([[User:Littleolive oil|Littleolive oil]] ([[User talk:Littleolive oil|talk]]) 14:06, 19 September 2016 (UTC))

:::There was a bit of overuse of the word &quot;claim,&quot; I did a bit of wikignoming on that.  Yeah, we won't be a featured article any time soon, but that works well enough for now to settle the immediate issue.

== Note ==

big bolus of unsourced content was added back in 2009 in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander_technique&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=291335709 this dif].  Need to see where that come from... [[User:Jytdog|Jytdog]] ([[User talk:Jytdog|talk]]) 09:40, 19 September 2016 (UTC)

:That section has a few sources now.  Looks like it is mostly descriptive.  Probably no rush there, as it describes concepts, makes no scientific claims.
