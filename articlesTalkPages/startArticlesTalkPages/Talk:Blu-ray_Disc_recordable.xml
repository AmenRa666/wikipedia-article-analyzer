== Fair use image needed ==

This article is in need of a fair use image of a BD-R. If someone can upload one that would be greatly appreciated. --[[User:Jzhang|Jack Zhang]] 04:49, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

== Currency type needed ==

This article mentions several prices, in dollars, but does not state which nation's dollars are meant. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/203.97.251.203|203.97.251.203]] ([[User talk:203.97.251.203|talk]]) 06:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned --&gt;

:Isn't the standard is you don't specify what country Dollars you are talking about the assumtion is it's USD?  [[User:Arwen4014|Arwen4014]] ([[User talk:Arwen4014|talk]]) 12:39, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

Well if you can covert £ (Pounds) in Great Britain into dollars (USA) or whatever country you need a conversion in, a Blu-Ray Disc ReWriteable with a 25GB compacity (BR-RE) costs £(GB) 24.94, this is for a single disc, that has enouth for 240 minutes of recording time. [[User:J2F Duck|J2F Duck]] ([[User talk:J2F Duck|talk]]) 07:02, 20 February 2008 (UTC)

While on this subject I see there are estimated costs of the Recorders and DIscs on the page.   I'm going to update them because the prices are falling.   But what about just removing that information all together. [[User:Arwen4014|Arwen4014]] ([[User talk:Arwen4014|talk]]) 12:41, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

== CD Link is incorrect ==

The CD link on the page links to Compant Disc instead of Compact Disc.

== Theoretical Maximum of reading ==

the page states that the theoretical maximum of reading would be around 12x because any faster the disc would wobble too much to be read properly. I think that's a practical and not a theoretical limit.  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/88.0.142.204|88.0.142.204]] ([[User talk:88.0.142.204|talk]]) 22:20, 13 January 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

:People out there try to guess when BD-RE 4x will get out. Why isn't it there? Is there a theoretical limit as well?

There should be footnotes made for each drive speed to make note of when a commercial drive has been made available and an asterisk next to each speed that has yet to be made viable at the consumer level.
== Laser frequency. ==

Does anyone here know the frequency that the Blu-ray-recordable laser operates at?

== Max file size? ==
Where do I find out the max file size that can be burned? I'm sick of rarring huge files into chunks to burn on DVD-R -- with the max 2G filesize. Not having to do that would be a big reason for me to switch despite the triple-per-byte blank media cost... [[User:ClintJCL|ClintJCL]] ([[User talk:ClintJCL|talk]]) 02:28, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

: I've just been trying to figure this out.  I can't find information on the web.  Writing a single file the size of the free space reported by Windows (47332mb exactly) doesn't work; when you come to burn, Windows says the burn requires 48.9 GB.  That's not useful, since it's rounded off.  [[User:Toby Douglass|Toby Douglass]] ([[User talk:Toby Douglass|talk]]) 21:28, 17 May 2010 (UTC)

: The max file size is calculated no differently than for a CD or DVD - it is a function of the file system used when authoring and capacity of the media. Using the [[Universal_Disk_Format|UDF]] 2.50 format when writing backup files to BD media yields a max single file size of 16EB; well beyond the capacity of any media you will be using. I don't think this information would be particularly valuable in this article as it has nothing to do with the media itself - rather the manner in which information is recorded to the media.

== New Egg Spam ==

Is it fair to add such commercial site's reference.

== Correction of the mebibyte values ==
36 Mbit = 36 x 10 &lt;sup&gt; 6 &lt;/sup&gt; bit = 4500000 bytes = 4.5 MB

1 MiB = 2 &lt;sup&gt; 20 &lt;/sup&gt; = 1024 kibibyte = 1048576 bytes

:Therfore:
:4500000 bytes / 1048576 bytes = 4.29 MiB

The same value is reached if you use the Ration SI/Binary of 0.9537 for megabyte to mebibyte for example in the article on [[Mebibyte]]:

4.5 MB x 0.9537 = 4.29165 MiB

9 MB x 0.9537 = 8.5833 MiB

18 MB x 0.9537 = 17.1666 MiB

27 MB x 0.9537 = 25.7499 MiB

36 MB x 0.9537 = 34.3332 MiB

45 MB x 0.9537 = 42.9165 MiB

54 MB x 0.9537 = 51.4998 MiB

([[User:Sababu|Sababu]] ([[User talk:Sababu|talk]]) 11:50, 18 September 2010 (UTC)).

:For the GB to GiB conversion factor 0.9313 would have to be used ([[Gibibyte]]):

:25 GB x 0.9313 = 23.2825 GiB
:50 GB x 0.9313 = 46.565 GiB

== wrong speed info for 1x, 2x, etc. ==

see &lt;ref&gt;[http://blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/White_Paper_General_3rd_Dec%202012_20121210.pdf blu-ray no-fee specification 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

the speeds given on the page are based on the speed of the hard drive reading the data, not the blu-ray media actual speed. the actual 1x speed is 36MB/s.
you can multiply for 2x to get 72MB/S etc. Blu-ray specification organization probably erroneously uses SI units instead of IEC units in their specification. and I suspect that since the disc industry uses GiB for disc data sizes, you should probably also use (?) MiB for the speed, since Microsoft typically also uses MiB and labels it as MB, etc., a lot of the industry does this (like with RAM, SSD's etc)...
so 

* 1x=36MiB/s×1=36MiB/s
* 2x=36MiB/s×2=72MiB/s
* 3x=36MiB/s×3=108MiB/s
* 4x=36MiB/s×4=144MiB/s
* 6x=36MiB/s×6=216MiB/s
* 8x=36MiB/s×8=288MiB/s
* 10x=36MiB/s×10=360MiB/s
* 12x=36MiB/s×12=432MiB/s
* 14x=36MiB/s×14=504MiB/s
* 16x=36MiB/s×16=576MiB/s
* 18x=36MiB/s×18=648MiB/s
* 20x=36MiB/s×20=720MiB/s

and so on. also, for those who don't know the difference between IEC (computer units) and SI units, I wrote a web page which shows the differences. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesusnjim.com/conversions/SI-units-IEC-units.html SI and IEC Units compared side-by-side]&lt;/ref&gt; see also the web page on IEC unit specification &lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html IEC unit definitions: The binary prefixes]&lt;/ref&gt; .
