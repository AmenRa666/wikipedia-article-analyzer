== Coates's cider ==

It would be good to add something about the Coate's cider factory to this page.
Does anyone have a reliable source that they could use?
[[User:J Hawker|J Hawker]] ([[User talk:J Hawker|talk]]) 17:20, 31 March 2008 (UTC)
:I can't find much apart from links with [[Adge Cutler]] who used to work there, but {{cite book |last=Haley |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Wordsworth Dictionary of Drink |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5X6oVI-qngwC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=coates+cider+nailsea&amp;source=web&amp;ots=S2FfH8j64v&amp;sig=O12xDdtcAjJ4CU-CePpu0H9OQeM&amp;hl=en#PPA151,M1 |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2005 |month= |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |location= |language= |isbn=1840223022 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=151 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }} does say: it was bought by Showerings of Shepton Mallet in 1956. And that the brand was later merged with Gaymers and absorbed by Matthew Clark Brands. Also the [http://www.ukcider.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Producers_in_Somerset cider wiki] (not [[WP:RS]] which says an oak vat from Coates was moved to Rich's Farmhouse Cider in Watchfield. I think the whole article should be revised in line with [[Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements]] and then this could be brought into the history or economy sections?&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:50, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

== Religious sites ==

I dispute the fact that &quot;Nailsea is a largely Christian town, being approximately 78% Christian, with 'no religion' the second largest group with 16% of the population.&quot;  This is clearly nonesense.  There is no settlement in Britain (or elsewhere) where nearly 4 out of 5 people would claim to be a Christian.  Conversely, there is no settlement where a mere 16% of the populus would describe themselves as being Aethiest.  If these figures were true, then Nailsea would be a barren cultural and spiritual monoculture, which it is not!  The truth of the matter is that about 5% of the British public purport to being a Christian.  Nailsea is no different!  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/77.3.69.33|77.3.69.33]] ([[User talk:77.3.69.33|talk]]) 20:34, 5 February 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
:The figures used for this (&amp; correctly cited) are from the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]]. Do you have any published surveys or other data which would give a different view? There are towns in Britain where Christianity is no longer as dominant (eg [[Leicester]] where only 44.7% of the population declare themselves as christian). Therefore I feel it is an appropriate piece of information to include in this article and will help readers (from all over the world) to get a picture of what Nailsea is like.&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:08, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
:Interestingly the figures for the whole of England from the 2001 census show Christian: 71.75%, No Religion: 14.81% (see [[Demography of England]] for more) so in this respect Nailsea is fairly typical of England as a whole.&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:17, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
:I take your point about the 2001 Census returns.  However, there is a world of difference between what people wrote in response to that misleading question and the reality of what happens in church on a sunday morning - as statistics produced by the Church itself reveals (see [http://www.vexen.co.uk/UK/religion.html#ChurchAttendance]).  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/77.3.105.223|77.3.105.223]] ([[User talk:77.3.105.223|talk]]) 06:45, 7 February 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


:Would it not be possible to change the wording of the section in question, so that it states that the percentages given are derived from the census? Something like this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:In the 2001 census 78% of Nailsea's respondents claimed 'Christianity' as their religious preference, with 16% of respondents claiming 'no religious preference', the second largest group.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:This would emphasise the relatively old source, and the fact the data comes from a census, allowing readers to form their own conclusions as to its reliability. --[[User:ThisSpace|ThisSpace]] ([[User talk:ThisSpace|talk]]) 20:22, 9 December 2009 (UTC)
::This seems reasonable &amp; I have changed to the text you suggested - just adding wikilinks &amp; improving the citation of the sources.&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:50, 9 December 2009 (UTC)

== Distance from Bristol? ==

In the lead it says Nailsea is about 7 miles from Bristol &amp; in geography 8 miles - surely they should both be the same if it is to be repeated.&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:17, 23 November 2009 (UTC)

== What else is needed to get this article to GA? ==

I've been looking at the guidelines at [[WP:UKCITIES]] and would be interested in what other editors think is need to get this article to meet the [[Wikipedia:Good article criteria]]? Obviously we need to reference (or remove) the uncited claims, but is there anything else which would be required?&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:30, 4 July 2010 (UTC)
:I'm up for it. I think that the Education section and the Sport section would need a small extention with more references (I'll get to that later) and some extentions on the article all together (there seems to be some layout issues). But other than that the articles looks fine. However, the history of the town seems to be a bit small and the Governance doesn't have any citations at all. I'll be happy to help out as soon as possible but those are the things that would need to be mentioned anyway. [[User:Jaguar|Jaguar]] ([[User talk:Jaguar|talk]]) 20:10, 25 April 2011 (UTC)
::Thanks - I've added some references for the governance section. What layout issues are you seeing?&amp;mdash; [[User:Rodw|Rod]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rodw|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:43, 25 April 2011 (UTC)
:::It might just be me on my eighteen mile long monitor but I have minimised the window and still see a few images taking up some numurous sections. For example photo of the church does take up a couple of headers in the Religious Sites section which might cause a few layout issues for some people but it shouldn't matter too much. A few prose extensions in the article could sort them out; I will be happy to extend them but other than that the article looks great!
