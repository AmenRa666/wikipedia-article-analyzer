== Singular or Plural ==

I support using the singular since it is a single band. We wouldn't say &quot;Frosted flakes are a brand of cereal&quot; we would say &quot;Frosted flakes is a brand of cereal&quot; bands like [[The Black Eyed Peas]] use the singular. It is not the plural are I think it makes more sense and is more accurate. inviting [[User:Bruce1ee]] to provide feedback if they would like. [[User:Bryce Carmony|Bryce Carmony]] ([[User talk:Bryce Carmony|talk]]) 06:10, 6 October 2015 (UTC)
:[[Comparison of American and British English#Formal and notional agreement]] states that in British English collective nouns normally use plural verb forms, while in American English they use singular verb forms, ''except'' when the collective noun is plural, in which case a plural verb is used. The Beach Boys is a plural collective noun, so &quot;are&quot; is used, not &quot;is&quot;. —[[User:Bruce1ee|Bruce1ee]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Bruce1ee|''talk'']]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:23, 6 October 2015 (UTC)
::Using that logic we would say &quot;Frosted Flakes are a brand of cereal&quot; Which we wouldn't do. Why would we use your argument only when it selectively suits you? lots of bands (Guns n Roses, The Wallflowers, etc) use Is not are. This article is about the band. the band is named the beach boys. The Beach boys is the band this article is about. The beach boys are the band this article is about? to me Is not only sounds more readable it's more accurate. Since there is only one band named the beach boys the band is singular. Just like the united states is singular because while it has 50 states it's a single entity. the Beach boys had multiple members but is still only a single band.

:&quot;The Beach Boys were a great band&quot; - yes.  &quot;The Beach Boys was great&quot; - umm.... no.  [[User:Ghmyrtle|Ghmyrtle]] ([[User talk:Ghmyrtle|talk]]) 08:48, 6 October 2015 (UTC)
::You are confusing referring to something as a hole and referring to something as a combination of individuals. Pop-tarts is yummy to eat = makes no sense, reffering to individual pop-tarts as each being delicious to eat. compared to Pop-tarts is a brand. which refers to the &quot;brand&quot; as a single entity. The Beach Boys (the boys who made up the band) =/= &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; the band itself. Just like the &quot;Utah Jazz&quot; Franchise =/= The players on the &quot;Utah Jazz&quot; team. It's subtle but makes sense. League of Legends is a fun game, not League of Legends are a fun game. why? because the game is a single entity. You can't go off of &quot;what sounds right&quot; you have to go off the conventions of grammar.
:::Some people miss the point about this. When a band's name includes a plural noun for a group of people, such as &quot;The Beach Boys&quot;, &quot;Eagles&quot;, &quot;Carpenters&quot;, then it is usually more grammatically correct or common sense to use &quot;are&quot; instead of &quot;is&quot; and &quot;were&quot; instead of &quot;was&quot; and so on. It is just grammatical silly to say &quot;The Beach Boys ''is'' a band&quot; instead of &quot;The Beach Boys ''are'' a band. The verb in this case refers to a plural entity (the band members) and not the singular entity (a band).

::::I agree if we were referring to the individual members of the band I would say are. Those beach boys are so cool. but the boys are in a band that is titled &quot;the beach boys&quot; which this article is about. so when we say &quot;The Beach boys is a band&quot; that's 100% correct. No style guide written treats the title of a singular entity in the plural. [[User:Bryce Carmony|Bryce Carmony]] ([[User talk:Bryce Carmony|talk]]) 15:38, 6 October 2015 (UTC)

== Wilson, Jardine and Marks still in 'current members' ==

Isn't it time to remove them? They haven't been in the band for a good few years now.  &lt;small class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/101.98.246.64|101.98.246.64]] ([[User talk:101.98.246.64|talk]]) 14:24, 8 May 2016 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
